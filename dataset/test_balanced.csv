1.0,Tablet broke in the case.
1.0,"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience."
1.0,Horrible!!! Stopped working at 9 mos.. Do not buy
1.0,I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.
1.0,"I made a purchase of a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive and up to now I realize that their capacity is less than 1GB, please I require help, whether it was a mistake or damaged pen drive wine"
1.0,"I purchase it on July 26/2015, as soon as I connect to my computer it got installed, follow all the instruction, mess with it for over an hour and finally gave up, couldn't make it work, today is Aug 30/2015, try to return it, but expiration date to return was Aug27, not happy with the product, instruction on the box can miss lead you easily, I'll be careful next time ordering anything from Amazon! not happy at all"
1.0,Just got this today. First i noticed that it come with 2 usb ports one you have to use to plug it up so you only really get one extra. Also set up on my laptop and started running it for like 20minutes then laptop crashed. I have HP dv7. Where it vents from the corner and theres really no fan in the corner. Maybe my 17inch laptop is 2 big but the only thing i liked about it is its quiet and clips that keep your laptop in one place.
1.0,"The plastic that holds the iPad in place started to break after four weeks.  Surprising, because the case never got damaged, or dropped.  I would suggest people to buy something else"
1.0,Drive is slower than SSDs purchased nearly 4 years ago.
1.0,"This is frustrating. I bought this sky wifi smartpen and very dissapointed because it is not working. I live in Istanbul and if I send it back to USA for a replacement, sending it is also quite a lot cost and waste of money and waste of time. I heard that the company charges $49 for a replacement and,that means this pen will cost me almost $300 rather than $200 (also adding the shipment cost) even that it is not my fault. My pen was brand new and seeing it not working after unpacking my product is very very dissapointing. Never used and it seems like I purchased a defected device, which is not working at all. No lights, no sounds, nothing... I searched internet for a solution and found out that I'm not the only one. There are many many buyers complaining about the same problem. This pen is a total dissapointment."
1.0,My tablet screen cracked because of the case the pen cracked it
1.0,Terrible product! My daughter received it as a gift and the battery keeps dying and there is no storage to speak of.  Spend a bit more and buy an iPad.
1.0,Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues.
1.0,"Absolute junk. Poor image quality. Flimsy construction. (It fell apart in my hands taking it out of the box.) The method for updating firmware is a joke. It does NOT connect with the Amcrest NVR that Foscam sells, even though Foscam tells you it does. (Amcrest tech support told me they have LOTS of problems with Foscam cameras, ESPECIALLY THE C1.) If you for some reason decide to purchase this garbage, put Foscam's tech support phone number in your speed dial-you're gonna need it.<br />AVOID-AVOID-AVOID!!!!"
1.0,"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on."
1.0,I wish I had returned it. I've had wired versions of this mouse I've used for over ten years. LOVE IT. However this one never tracks correctly. I've tried gaming mouse pads and different placements of the usb connector. Nothing helps. It sucks. REALLY WISH I HAD THE CORDED VERSION. =(
1.0,It fractured after 1 month
1.0,"This thing might be OK, but unbelievably, it can not be set up to boot when power is applied.  Someone has to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time it's powered up.  This makes it useless for Kiosk work, which is a role that it would be perfect for otherwise.  I've never heard of a computer that didn't have a &#34;Boot when power applied&#34; option in the BIOS.  This is a bizarre and severe limitation."
1.0,I does NOT fit correctly in my phone.  Because of that it doesn't even register that it's in my phone.
1.0,hand worked anything I plugged it in.
1.0,"I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating ""media scanning"" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don't believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It's a dud. So disappointing."
1.0,"Loved the price  but not durable at all, back broke off in one week (normal use) didn't drop or used inappropriately.  Case fits good, and iPad is protected just missing back arm."
1.0,Bought hoping to use all 10 ft of the cord. All 3 have stopped working because the Lightning plug part wore out from being bent around a lot. To fragile to be used. Better luck just buyin and extension cord with a 3' charging cable if you want use it far from an outlet
1.0,"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card."
1.0,When my iPhone 6 is plugged in using this charger the phone starts randomly changing screens and does not respond correctly when I try to type on it.
1.0,Overheats in minutes. Lasted 3 days.
1.0,Dosent work for Xbox like it says it does
1.0,Worse reception than my Belkin n100 router I had. Returned it. Good interface but poor range
1.0,"It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I'm still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon's return policy was quick and painless."
1.0,"all 3 does't work , come with connectivity problem"
1.0,They stopped charging after a week
1.0,"When attempting to play a blu-ray dvd, the drive ejects itself and re-connects itself to my computer continuously until I give up. Very very poor product."
1.0,Until it broke it was great then send it in to get repaired and now it's very very slow and there's voices in the background which I have no idea to get rid of
1.0,Works 30% of the time.  iPad stops charging with a &#34;Device not supported&#34; error.
1.0,"The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB.  See &#34;http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTSE9H_us.pdf&#34; for Kingston DTSE9 product specifications and check for yourself.  In fact, *nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. The top capacity on the market is the 1TB Kingston Predator.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.  You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.se drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves.

1.0,"It did not work at all, it was a dud, and I was unable to return it."
1.0,"Showed up under search for &#34;portable blu-ray player&#34;  but is actually a blu-ray disc/recording device.  Had purchased this for grandchild to watch movies in the car, but there is no screen and it is not portable - must be plugged into a PC.  I have returned it."
1.0,Some keys stopped working on the qwerty row of the keyboard a few days after I received this product.
1.0,"After 32 days of use, conveniently just after the return window, the space bar stopped working, rendering it useless.  Do not recommend."
1.0,Very sad the mouse pad has a mind of its own since day one. I had a different keyboard that looks similar and actually cheaper which worked fine. This one is disappointing.
1.0,Came with a blown speaker replaced it and new one came with a blown speaker as well buy from razor instead
1.0,I ordered this on the 19th and was satisfied with the quick shipping only to be disappointed by the product itself. The product itself was too large to fit in the laptop to charge.
1.0,Although while it worked it worked we loved it. I am very disappointed that the warranty is only for a year and a year and one week after I bought this for my son we ended up with a black screen and were unable to get the issue resolved and were offered a &#34;deal&#34; on a new one. I passed... if they don't last more than a week after the warranty without any options to fix it I will go with a different product.
1.0,"I have RCN in Chicago. Currently they are upgrading everyone to 110Mbps at the same monthly price as 50Mbps... PLUS they are requiring this equipment. Wired downloads are 100Mbps+, which is great. Wireless cannot get above 40Mbps. The tech specs claim that this modem is capable of 3x3 wireless (aka 450Mbps download over wifi)... but that is not possible with the current firmware, which RCN will NOT allow to be upgraded. I was getting faster Wifi with a 50Mbps provider speed and a cheaper router."
1.0,"Don't buy this laptop, it's good at first but after 3 days of having it problems started popping up. First connection kept getting disconnected and 2days after that, the &#34;BSOD&#34; Driver Power State Failure kept happening every 30 minutes. I'm just here to help you save your time and money."
1.0,"HUGE disappointment. Battery life horrible, even reading books.  Hard to connect to internet even sitting directly in front of a modem.  Wish I had spent the extra money on Ipad mini.  Will not recommend this product to anyone."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on this! I have had nothing but problems with this laptop! It freezes up, it shuts down and takes away all my desktop setting randomly (the background picture and custom color) I have to manually clear the cache every few weeks or the internet is so slow that it takes a while to even type something out! Speaking of internet... the only browser it will run properly is Explorer. It barely functions after running Netflix or Photoshop even if you exit out of them... and I find the touchscreen pointless. That is a feature I just don't use.<br /><br />Buy a different laptop, because this one is not worth the money! I would give it a zero rating if I could."
1.0,"Gave this item as a gift this week, just past the 30-day return window. When my son opened the package the tablet was DOA. It would not charge. Would not power on. We tried other micro USB chargers, to no avail. I believe DEAL CHASER should either replace this item or refund my money."
1.0,"Battery did not work,  I return it"
1.0,The charger on this tablet is very loose and almost impossible to use
1.0,Not user friendly at all.  Have brought earlier models which I liked.
1.0,Product stopped working after a day. Worst waste of money ever
1.0,doesn't fit at all
1.0,No option to give below this. I thought that the Battery had gone in just 20 uses in 2 months.. can't believe. Was very slow too. No customer service.. Worst. Can't even be repaired since it's totally gone.. seems like mother board died within 2 months.. How can I get my money back ?
1.0,O.K
1.0,Worked great the first few weeks but will no longer turn on.  Its 3 days before the cut off of not being able to return it any longer.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE.  I've had to replace it 3x, and on the 4th replacement I gave up and just took their 80% refund.  That's right, they would not refund 100% when the Kindle never worked properly.<br /><br />Now let me tell you about how I used it... I used it to repeat ONE song to put my kids to sleep.  It only repeated an ocean waves/white noise song.  Over and over, it's only task.  Three different kindles, all ended up frozen on either the AMAZON screen or the FIRE screen.<br /><br />They were very kind to send replacements.  Sure they came quickly but they all froze doing the same task even w/ different song files.  Save yourself the money and the headache of continually replacing this thing.  I plan on using my 80% refund on buying a real white noise machine which I know will not freeze."
1.0,No appreciable increase in signal strength
1.0,"forget loading this into your cart.  a one day pause and this junk went up 16.99, in ONE DAY.  I don't give money to aXXholes."
1.0,"Apparently I know 2 people including myself who have received defective units and also returned it. My provider, Cox, blamed it on the modem since once they replaced it with a different modem, the service was working fine and smoothly."
1.0,Broken sent back
1.0,Macbook Pro stopped recognizing drive. Lost CD inside because of &#34;no eject button&#34; Very noisy while running. Sent back for refund. Do not buy this drive.
1.0,"I have used this cable about once a month since I received it. A little over one year after purchasing, it does not work anymore. Disappointed."
1.0,This has got to be one of the worse controllers I've came across in years. I got this one from Gamestop and within a week the right thumb stick got stuck in the up position. It looks like a spring must have broken in it. Best to get the sony version while they still make them because this is  some shhhhh it!
1.0,"I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  I'm glad their returns are so easy!"
1.0,"Contrary to the description, this does NOT fit a Toshiba L750 Satellite laptop."
1.0,"bad, I never worked, has bug in the software"
1.0,"It lasted me about 3 months, now it's a paperweight. It's not worth the small amount of money, spend a few more dollars and buy a decent battery."
1.0,Just image we bought this piece of junk hoping to get our monies worth. It worked for eight months and crashed!!! The warranty for this product was approxiamately 1 to 2 months. That says a lot about this product. Good luck to those people who bought this product and it went beyond eight months. Amazon labeled this product as new! The customer service label or sticker found below the laptop was tampered with. Nice one Amazon.
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these, hoping at least 1 would work.  Wishful thinking on my part...  Both quit responding as I downloaded files to them, and could no longer be recognized by WIN7.  Windows offered the option of formatting the drives - at a maximum of 32GB.  This is a total scam..."
1.0,"Cable barely works, only charges my phone like half the time"
1.0,"My Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD works fine with a 16GB SanDisk card, but the 32GB card died in less than 3 months.  SanDisk will replace the card under warranty, but the SanDisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month.  For two months, the card worked flawlessly, and then it started to have intermittent errors.  I thought it might be a problem with my phone, so I tried a 16GB card, and I never had a problem. When I returned to the 32GB card, the intermittent problems returned and got worse.  Eventually the card completely died, and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computer-connected card reader.  Both Windows 7 and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when it's well seated.I plan to update this when I have used my warranty-replacement card for three months, but that will be at least four months from now."
1.0,"It worked fine at a start and offered great speeds, but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day (at least once per hour).  That made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time.  I installed Watchdog and noticed that the Google+ process also incremented its CPU usage.  I read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microSD cards, probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted.  In another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation SanDisk microSD cards.Now I decided to purchase a Samsung one which can be found similarly priced.  My phone stopped acting up, and its battery life came back to normal."
1.0,"Junk! Do not buy! Bought 2, returning both."
1.0,Awful controller. Buttons don't work
1.0,I bought this for the exact model but it doesn't fit at all.
1.0,The only reason I give one star is that I cant give zero stars.Just lost all my files in the SD in my S3. I cant believe I trust my valuable information in this company. AVOID THIS ITEM. Dont recommend it.
1.0,"Fast card while it worked.  Died less than a week after return period expired....  Must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive.  Some fail, some last forever.  Not SanDisk's fault, not amazons fault - it is what it is.  BUT it is for this reason that i think Amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category.  Dont worry amazon, i still love you - but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one..."
1.0,"First of all I am not sure if the product i received is a CLASS 10 memory card. The reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my WINDOWS 8 system is 1.4 MB/Sec. Also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive 'Disk Cannot Be Formatted' error.I am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop, Do not recommend SANDISK please check other brands."
1.0,"Product arrived and worked for only a month. Now it will not take a charge, it says plugged in not charging. I would not recommend this manufacture of laptop batteries. Shop around and always read the the reviews."
1.0,"When I first got this router it worked flawlessly. It has been three months and now the wireless connection is the most frustrating connection I've dealt with in my life. If I restart the router it works fine for about five minutes, and after that it regularly pings greater than 500ms locally. It is not a connection issue by my devices as several devices in my home all have horrible ping to this router. inSSIDer shows that the signal is strong and isn't dropping so it must be something with the actual routing and not the wireless connection itself.<br /><br />It makes basic wireless internet browsing a horrendous experience, let alone online gaming which is half of what I purchased this router for."
1.0,These cables did not work at all for charging any of the IPad models we have that use the lightning connector. So I'm not sure why they would even sell them claiming that they did.
1.0,Purchased this to record an epic rubicon trail trip. Within two hours I got an sd card failure. Had to break out a slower card to finish recording trip.  FAIL.
1.0,"I've requested a replacement, so I'll update this review after I receive a replacement.  But the first card I got, it could be read, but every time I put it into the computer, it said there were errors with it.  It couldn't repair the errors.  I couldn't even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work.  I could create folders on the card, but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders.  I tried many many things and nothing worked.  I know SanDisk makes decent products, so I will change the review later."
1.0,"You can do anything with the remote and even google remote on your phone. It is cheap chineses made, if you has been use chineses product made you known what I mean . Just me , it is very difficult use the signal from remote very interrupt. Don't buy it, try Product made by USA company like Amazon, Apple and Google cast"
1.0,"Terrible. Do not buy!!! Tip broke off the first one I ordered in less than a week. Purchased a second one, thinking maybe it was something I'd done, but tip broke off of that one as well."
1.0,"Have been through two of these - one within the warranty, one just past warranty.  While performance was good (albeit short range on the 5g band) - they didnot last!  Problems occur with loosing one of the two bands - intermittently - followed by a full failure.  Both these units had full UPS protection their whole short little lives so it's not a power problem. Both used in a nominal home setting (approx 10 connected devices).  Too expensive to try again.  Excellent statistical end-of-life engineering ASUS!"
1.0,Not very good.
1.0,they worked for one week and then diied
1.0,"The product is flawless. The software updates are not. They took over an hour to install and update. My on screen keyboard is UNUSABLE it's so slow. A hard reset fixed it today, for the time being. I've heard one or two say that it went back to being slow after a few days. Time will tell.<br /><br />Hold down the power button for 15 seconds or so, until it shuts down. Do not hit anything on the screen when it asks you if you want to power down. Just hold down the power button until it shuts off. Wait 20 seconds before turning it back on. If it helps you, find this post useful. This needs more attention.<br /><br />The product itself is worth five stars but if the new software update makes the keyboard useless, then you can barely use your kindle the way it's meant to be used and that's a big deal. Even a brand new car with a shot out motor is only worth a few hundred bucks. I wanted to rate this higher, but I can't.<br /><br />Please fix this! Swype and keyboard functions are ESSENTIAL.<br /><br />EDIT: it's slow again today, I had to repeat the process."
1.0,"not good at all. after a week, a key felt down"
1.0,Kindle Reader was returned because it was not as versatile as my Kindle Fire.  Protection Plan was therefore not usable nor transferable to my other unit.
1.0,The stand is sub-par and doesn't even attach to the ipad.  Taking the label off left a sticky mess that I can't remove.  Now I find out it would cost more to return it than I paid for the item.
1.0,This battery did not last one hour.  The amount of money charged for this battery was totally not worth it.  Even though they returned most of my money I would not recommend it at all for any reason.  Save your money with this company.
1.0,"Got this to use with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition. Put it in, seemed to work. tried to get the data from the card after using it for a second and the card says it needs to be formatted.Looked to gopro's website and it is NOT on their recommended card list. Reason being is that the card isn't fast enough. It's a class ten yes but clearly not fast enough.Definitely get the recommended card, IF it does work at first it will probably die in a couple of days."
1.0,It keeps disconnecting and the volume isn't that high
1.0,"I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on 'mount sd card' it said it didn't understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It's extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don't understand why it's that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn't know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster..."
1.0,Top handle ripped within a week. So dissatisfied with this purchase.
1.0,"Very disappointed!  This is my 5th, and last, Toshiba. I bought this laptop specifically because the specs say the memory is upgradeable to 16g, which I wanted to do to improve the speed of video editing.  What Toshiba is falling to tell customers is that the memory can only be upgraded by them, at an obscenely expensive cost...almost as much as the laptop.  All my other Toshiba's allowed me to upgrade my memory via a little access door on the bottom.  Not this one.  There's no way for the user to upgrade the memory, and Toshiba is intentionally misleading consumers by not stating this fact in the specs, or on the Amazon sale page.  Likewise with the hard drive.  If you want to change the HD to a SSD, or even have to re-seat the HD (which my older Toshiba has required more than once)  it's not possible.  This laptop is specifically designed to cost the user as much money as possible when it needs anything at all. Even the simplest of upgrades requires an expensive trip to Toshiba.  This laptop is so woefully deficient in memory that you can't even take a screenshot of a Facebook page when you have no other program open but your browser, and 55% of your memory available. (See photo)  Secondly, this laptop is physically dangerous in that the edge is so sharp it actually cuts your wrists when trying to type on it.  Perhaps Toshiba anticipated that customers would want to slit their wrists after waisting $700.00 on this cheaply made hunk of junk?  If so, this laptop is equipped to do the job.  Simply sliding your hand over to the numbers pad can draw blood....really.  Unfortunately, since it was not &#34;dead on arrival&#34; I can't send it back to Amazon, so I'm stuck with an over priced hunk of junk and the hope that there will be a class action suit regarding both the wrist slashing, and Toshiba's false and misleading claim that the memory is upgradeable.  Unless you are contemplating suicide by laptop keyboard, avoid this Toshiba like the plague.."

1.0,Doesn't work at all!!
1.0,"Very unhappy with this card.  I used it to shoot pictures of my husband driving the &#34;8 laps at Daytona&#34; drive.....  Looked at the photos on the card in the camera, they were all there and they were great pictures!  I went to download it to my computer and the picture card crashed, I lost all of the photos!  Not at all happy with the card, but my IT department saved the day and they were able to recover the photos!  So, a once in a lifetime experience was lost and then found!  But, if I hadn't known someone I would have lost those memories forever!"
1.0,"I expected the color to be a little brighter than it actually is. Also, the material looks really cheap.

1.0,"I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just ""a dud"", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead."
1.0,This computer is regretfully slow and not what I expected.

1.0,"Just as someone else had experienced, the cable started having issues after only a few days. At first, I had to wiggle it into a particular position to get it to work, and then it ceased to work completely. Bad QC I guess.<br /><br />I haven't tried to return it, because my time is worth more money than what it's worth. If they sent me a package to return it, I would, but I'm not going to all the trouble of sending it back. I got another cable by another manufacturer (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TZH85K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it's working properly so far. If the second one fails, I'll probably buy an Apple version of the product, because I have to have it this or two of my monitors become useless for my Intel NUC."
1.0,"This is a review of the *bundle*, not the actual NUC.<br /><br />The RAM is cheap Chinese crap that offers extremely poor performance.

1.0,"[IMO]<br />Although I don't own a G933, but I own a G930.<br />After reading all product description, I think this is a rip off for a gaming headset with this price tack.<br />Reason as follow:<br />1. As always, you cannot get a real 7.1 headset from Logitech because of the cost I think, so the claiming of 7.1 surround sound must come along with the famous buggy Logitech control software. So the * come behind 7.1 surround sound actually saying,&#34;YOU CAN ONLY GET 7.1-LIKE SURROUND SOUND WHEN YOU USING PC AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSOLE &#34;<br />2. Carrying the same idea from the last point, the claim of Multi-Platform Compatibility actually is silly, G933 can support it just because a 3.5 mm audio jet was added as one of the inputs. once you plug the audio on this G933, here is what you got: A WIRED, STEREO headset with LED lighting on it, it do sound like a $20 headset to me. ...<br />What?! it is a $200 gaming headset?! Come on!<br />3. Customizable lighting? What the...?! I CANNOT EVEN see the lighting on the headset while I am wearing it! COME ON genius!<br />4. G930 is a much reasonable choice I think, if you know how to fix the auto-turn off issue by a hack on the Logitech gaming software<br />[/IMO]"

1.0,Does not fit Samsung note 10.1 but clearly says it does?
1.0,"If you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. I bought this card in November of 2012 and it worked great for a while. The card started failing in my Galaxy Note 2 in the beginning of January. After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. If you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. I am glad I used dropbox for my phone so I did not lose any pictures or videos."

1.0,wrong part for my laptop hp xt178
1.0,Like many others I report that this piece of crap didn't work (Mini White HDMI to AV RCA Converter).  The RCA video (yellow video output) wouldn't sync up as input to a known good display device (tried switching this converter to either NTSC or PAL).  A total waste of money as Amazon won't give a refund.  It's clear these folks are putting out a fair number of these that are junk with only a few folks reporting success.  You can form your own theory as to how bad you want to imagine the depths of Chinese junk manufacturing. The single sheet &#34;User Guide&#34; is a similar joke.  The promotional-speak in it and on the box says no power adapter is required when in fact this box must be powered (using the supplied USB cable) by the 5 VDC of a USB port.  Don't waste your money and I wish Amazon had some way to just terminate availability of such a waste of time/money of their customers.  I am now all the more suspicious of buying anything more from Amazon in general.
1.0,Horrible!
1.0,I bought this bookbag for my husband to use for his college classes. He has some back problems so carrying his books can be hard on him . College books are not light and I needed a reliable bookbag that could handle the weight of a laptop and a few thick text books. I was disappointed in this bag the second I opened the box. The material the bag is made of is very thin. The stitching looks unreliable and I felt it would come lose easily. When I put the books in the bag the bag didnt seem like it was capable of holding them. There was no cushion or protection for the books. The straps are not well sewn on and also look as though they could come lose easily. Overall this seems like a cheaply made bag I could get from any walmart or target and I was completely unsatisfied with the purchase. A bookbag is something that needs to be well made and reliable and this one failed to meet those standards. I returned the bag for a refund immediately.
1.0,"Arris has the worst customer service ever!!!<br />The modem was stop working in 10 months, the modem still under warranty and Arris customer support  refuse to take it back to repair or replace."
1.0,I purchased this for a 4k monitor the AMH 399U (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XTVGM7C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00) (a korean monitor). I knew going in that the cables that came with the monitor wouldn't work and that they would cause flickering and complete picture loss. I purchased this cable preemptively. Upon receipt of the monitor I plug in the cable into my Gigabyte 290X video card and the monitor and was greeted with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. This was the highest this cable could do stating that it had an communication issue. The default cables with the monitor work at the appropriate resolution but flickered as expected. I don't know if this is an issue with length in excess of 2 meters or not. I ended up getting an Accell UltraAV B142C-007B cable and it works perfect. Maybe try the 6Ft version and milage may be better. For 4K stay away from this cable.
1.0,Computer would not boot up.  It powered up but would not boot up.  Sent back and ordered another.  Hopefully the new one will work properly.
1.0,"Horrible product. A month later, it stopped working. Reached out to seller and was told that it wasn't their problem, basically, and to contact Amazon customer service. Do not buy. Waste of money, especially when you're battery is on it's last leg. Look elsewhere."

1.0,"After this, I think I'm completely done with this brand. This is the 2nd HP laptop I have purchased (for school work, general Web surfing) where the screen just quits. 1st time I was in the middle of typing a report when I took a break for dinner. When I returned the screen was asleep (not unusual) but would not wake up (unusual). Pretty much the same thing happened again on this most recent purchase (Nov. 2013). This laptop has hardly been used and wasn't even opened until after Christmas.  It's been used maybe 1 week out of a month on average.  Possibly less. I spent more time on my cellphone because it was much faster responding.  I had/have verizon fios wifi and speeds were great on everything else connected.  Pretty ridiculous HP. The system lagged from the start and the touchscreen didn't seem very accurate so I mostly used the keyboard and mouse. I'll be staying away from HP laptops going forward  that is for sure!"
1.0,don't buy.....waist of money!
1.0,"This monitor arrived to my house broken, when it was posted as hardly been used."
1.0,DOES NOT cool laptop. Fans are moving but very little air is being put out. I bought this because it had a good rating. Makes one wonder about that now. Bad product!!!
1.0,"It's a beautiful however, the top case is very difficult to remove and the corners have already broken off on my case. I've only had it for a week and it is already falling apart. Will most likely use it for now and buy a better replacement that is more sturdy."

1.0,I have not been able to get one of these flash drives to work yet even formatting them
1.0,"I absolutely love this tablet!  Very clear screen, easy to see even with my eyes, quick processor, just the right thickness and weight.  Excellent memory capacity, with or without a card.  Only problem I've had is when it lays flat, the screen wants to go black and I have to pick it back up for the screen to come back on.  It almost acts like a bad battery connection.  Otherwise, I really love it!  Update:  I've had my tablet now for 5 months and it is really starting to have some issues.  Although I've made it a point not to put much on it,  it has become very slow, apps don't want to open, when they do, it returns to lock screen on its own, touch intermittently becomes unresponsive, screen continues to go black for no reason, and it quit reading my memory card, also made by Samsung.  Really getting apprehensive about this tablet lasting any amount of time  Update:  have had this 6 months now and the issues are almost unbearable.  Touch quits very frequently throughout the day,  it freezes, still not reading my memory card, have to restart it several times a day because the screen just goes black.  Update again:  contacted Samsung for assistance with these issues.  Nothing!  Not even a we can't help you! In spite of my entire family owing Samsung phones and tablets, I  am seriously questioning ever buying Samsung ever again."
1.0,Did not work to use PS/2 keyboard with USB port.
1.0,"I said I'd change my review if I got it to work and I did. This software is garbage, The USB to SATA drive works but forget cloning any drive/OS with the software. Use some freeware to get it to work. I'd go ZERO STARS if I could with this crap.<br /><br />I will change my rating if I get it to work, but so far, what a kludge of system.<br /><br />Specs: Lenovo Thinkpad i3 Core, 8 GB of RAM, Windows 7 Pro<br /><br />Firstly, if your old drive has bad sectors (which is why many of us replace an old drive), this is going to be a NIGHTMARE for you to use. I have learned this because the &#34;read&#34; part of this software will always find the two bad clusters (8,192 bits each) and freeze on its second scan of the disk and refuse to clone the drive even though it resolves all but 2 bits of read errors out of the 16,384 it finds and refuses to close out the cloning. 5 times so far today. Yes, chkdsk, SMART and Diskcheck just ignore/resolve these bad sectors, but this program won't.<br /><br />Secondly, it will only work well and at a decent speed if you created a bootable version of the software on a CD/DVD-RW or thumbdrive and boot it from there through BIOS. They neglect to tell you that. Don't try to clone from Windows, it's just not going to happen.<br /><br />Thirdly, for Lenovo users like me who are stuck with the bloatware we cannot get rid of, don't try to clone C: to USB. Lenovo won't export its Firmware of the HD to a USB beyond System Recovery. To even get your OEM HD to attempt to clone from a Lenovo to the new HD, you have to swap the original drive out, place it in the SATA-to-USB and install the new HD (SSD/SSHD) in the laptop's HD slot, boot the software for this program from BIOS and wait 45 minutes to see if your bad sectors will be read or not. (They probably won't.) Lenovo will let their proprietary garbage come *in* to the computer, but not *out* of it.<br /><br />I'm glad this system works for some or even maybe most, but it refuses to work for me even though it said it would.<br /><br />Based on the reviews I have seen about this company from those of us who can't use the Apricorn Upgrade System, I doubt Customer Support will be anything beyond &#34;I don't know&#34; if I try to resolve this due to our &#34;compatible&#34; systems not being compatible.<br /><br />I took a risk with Apricorn, I made a mistake. I'll keep trying to get it to work since I spent every last dollar my poor wallet had to save my computer and life's work, but I don't expect to spend a dime more with this company.seen about this company from those of us who can't use the Apricorn Upgrade System, I doubt Customer Support will be anything beyond &#34;I don't know&#34; if I try to resolve this due to our &#34;compatible&#34; systems not being compatible.

1.0,"I purchased this card (the 64GB version) to use in a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone. It worked perfectly for almost three months, at which point it just stopped mounting. The phone detects a card, but is incapable of formatting it. It's even worse on my computer, which does not even detect the card anymore (and yes, I'm using an SDXC-compatible USB reader).I contacted SanDisk for an RMA and they will probably replace it, although the replacement process is needlessly slow and painful.I had bought this card based on the glowing reviews, but I'm going to stay away from SanDisk products from now on."
1.0,"I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate."
1.0,horrible
1.0,The docs for my Smart Phone said that this card would work in it.  After talking to SanDisk support I was told that a 32GB card was the max for my phone.  So I returned this card for a 32GB.  This card is probably a very good product.  Just the documentation for my phone was bad.
1.0,"I bought this with Costco Black Friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago.  Today when I was transferring video files from my phone to the card, I wasn't able to because it stopped half way.  Now, nothing can be written on it.It was purchased from Costco, so it's not a fake Microsdhc card.  I tested it out its authenticity with an app on Google Play and verified that it's real too.  Still, it's a piece junk.  What is Sandisk doing to its reputation?I would advise shopper to choose other brands over this.  Surely, it's cheap; but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it?"

1.0,"Update 03/04/16: Nothing like bad customer service to ruin what should have been great product. If you are going to run hard tubing with this or any other combination of the AX series be ready to exchange rads several times before finding one without defect because if you wait longer than the return policy here on Amazon allows XSPC support will claim that their bad QC is an industry standard and that it not qualify this radiator for an RMA. The issue here is that the built in ports on this and my AX360 rads are in a angle. Why would that be a problem you ask? Well good luck running a straight run out of it into something else. It looks awkward and sometimes just plain not safe since you will be putting a strain on the tubing due to the angle of both fittings not matching. This should be grounds for a RMA but XSPC just plainly told me that it was not and it is quite common defect on rads... Yeah lost all my faith in this guys after that and for now on will move on to another brand. And will always thoroughly check the goods for minor junk like this that can go highly undetected.  My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on aesthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I don't care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recommend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture."

It's slow ..I have  amd  fx 8 core 4.0 ghz , geforce 960 superclocked 4gb ram and  still 16gbs or ram 1866 each  stick and yet i am unable to open  windows  in a decent time  ..I am far from happy this is the only motherboard from asus I have bought that has given me such headaches.. I have  gotten gigabit  but stopped cause of the fact their ports blow in like 6 months So I thought to buy Asus again and now I am stuck with a motherboard that  is not good .. I got this board to replace my old one after it fried  from my  fx 8 core processor and it was a decent price as I am on a limited income"
1.0,"I received the adapter today and plugged it into my Windows 10, usb3.0 enabled, solid state hard drive, i7-4790 4.0 ghz cpu, 16GB memory gaming machine. The machine sits next to a Macbook pro I use for work. Both connect to my Verizon FIOS home router via wireless connections.<br /><br />I expected there would be some slight slowdown in network speed given the Macbook has a built-in network card and there is USB translation going on with the Satechi USB connector. However, using www.speedtest.net (Ookla) from both machines, the Macbook pulled 3.49 Mbps up and 5.48 down, whereas the Satechi pulled 2.43 Mbps down and 0.62 up. I repeated the test three times at different times of the day and got very similar results.<br /><br />If you want a wireless connection for browsing Yahoo, Satechi will do it for you, but don't expect anything else.. I bought it based on some reviews on Newegg and Amazon which said the Satechi was surprisingly fast, and I simply don't see anywhere near &#34;surprising&#34; unless its &#34;surprisingly slow&#34;. Weighing whether I want to try returning the Satechi or whether I'll just eat the $20 I spent on it."
1.0,"The 64GB card I purchased actually contains 4GB of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64GB drive in various drives and readers. Of course, this took me a while to figure out since I only just got around to copying more than 4GB of data to the card, but with some testing I have nonetheless discovered this to be the case.The card I bought was in Amazon Frustration Free packaging. I don't know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions, but I suspect that I will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on."
1.0,"Very complicated to configure new drives, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Was spending a lot of time with their (relatively useless) phone support and figured out myself how to do it.<br />The unit does not work with four 5 TB drives, made it work with four 4 TByte.<br />It is slow, takes forever to boot up. The web interface suchs."
1.0,"GIGABYTE GA-H97N-WIFI motherboard failed after 10 months. Product includes 3-year warranty, one of the reason for my purchase. Very common problem with Gigabyte motherboards, according to Google. Warranty policy essentially requires customers to pay additional fees in order to receive warranty repairs. Called their customer care. Chuck Liu (service manager), Maggie Lin (warranty manager), Gary Tam (operations manager) all stated that the policy of requiring customers to pay additional fees to receive warranty repairs cannot be changed. Gigabyte is making defective products and selling them for profit. Attempts to have Gigabyte honor their warranty guarantee without additional charges have failed.<br /><br />Avoid Gigabyte at ALL COSTS! Unreliable products and horrific customer service. Their motherboard failed. Their warranty is more expensive than it looks. Total cost = retail price + retail shipping + cost of recovering data + cost of shipping to RMA center + cost of replacement motherboard. Just talked for over an hour to Chuck Liu, their service manager in CA, Maggin Lin, warranty manager, and Gary Tam, operations manager. According to Gary, he's the one running the whole US Gigabyte division. No one at Gigabyte can offer a truly no cost warranty. If your Gigabyte product breaks, you'll need to pay at least shipping to get it fixed. Do not take the chance with Gigabyte products. Gary hung up on me in the end because he had &#34;better things to do.&#34;<br /><br />Paid out-of-pocket and sent the motherboard in for &#34;free&#34; warranty. After Gigabyte received the package, they sent me pictures of the board coming apart in one corner. The board was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap for shipping. It's physically impossible for it to sustain such damage during shipping, especially when there's no indication of the outer packaging being damaged. Highly suspect that Gigabyte intentionally damaged the board to avoid dealing with &#34;demanding&#34; customers. Then they trashed the board that I bought, not even bothering to send it back. Could have used it for target practice or hung on the wall to remind all my clients of how bad Gigabyte is.<br /><br />I've been in tech support field for over a decade. Gigabyte really perfected the art of treating its customers like garbage. 2nd to none."
1.0,"My computer wouldn't recognize the first battery I received.  The seller replaced the battery, and the second battery worked well for about 3 months.  It has now stopped working.  I'm willing to try a third battery, but not sure how to contact the seller since I'm past Amazon's return policy.  Based on the current track record, I don't have high hopes for the third battery to work."
1.0,"If I could rate it less than 1, I would have.  I have had a number of computer users try to get the problem resolved for me. The last one was while I was on vacation, and my great (or is it grand, which she is) niece (who's Very Good at computers!) worked for 3 days on it and couldn't get it to work. Her mom took pity on me and got me an Apple keyboard which works!!!! They both suggested I return the Newstyle. It's obviously no use to me. It LOOKED good, but didn't turn out that way.

1.0,"After installing this software it seems to have damaged my operating system to the point that I had to rebuild my computer from the ground up. When I called the company for support (their 800 number) they said that their software had never had a problem. I am running Windows 10 and MS OFFICE PRO 2013.<br />I also gave him access to my machine. He then began asking me questions about the age of my computer, operating system, etc. Eventually he pulled up my task manager and showed me that all Microsoft items had stopped. He said that my computer was unstable and that I needed a level 3 technician's help to &#34;fix&#34; my VERY damaged computer (which was working fine before installing this product&#34;).<br />They were willing to provide a level 3 technician for a price!!! I knew it was useless to continue and hung up.<br />Having been in the computer industry since 1967 I decided to fix it myself which took several hours but now my computer is back working fine. I would NEVER EVER install this on any computer in the future (BTW - I bought my computer just 6 months ago and it is quite powerful and has never had an issue."

But they really let me down with these one.<br /><br />In my previous build i had these same fans but in red... Well, i bought a new case and said to myself ''I should try the ones with the white LED&#34; BIG MISTAKE! I ordered here and when i received them (I live in Dominican Republic btw) one of them was making an unbearable noise. Well, I contacted customer service and they sent me another pair... guess what? both of them were making the same noise. I wasn't planning on incurring in shipping/return charges so i decided to try them at a low speed and still the same noise. At the end i sold them and bought my fans locally (way more expensive but oh well).<br /><br />I don't know what happened but these white led fans disappointed me! I was expecting better, Corsair :("

1.0,"Similar to other critical posts I cannot get get this device to work in WISP mode with hotel wifi that presents a login page.  It seems to connect, but after browsing one or two pages (passed through excruciatingly slow) then every page after that redirects to the 192.168.8.1 setup page.  Forcing a 60 sec+ reboot at nearly each config change is unacceptable,  I'm disappointed because the form factor, minus the quality issues cited in other reviews, is great and I was looking forward to using this to be a single connectivity point for all devices while traveling.  I'll be returning this and looking into other gear noted in these reviews.  No point trying the wired access as I need both as advertised."
1.0,just when i got this laptop the Wifi kept turning off. I called tech support 4 times and each time I get someone who doesn't understand English. I got tired of trying to solve this issue with them and decided to return it. I wish companies in the US would hire people who have better command of the English language. This could be a small fix but i have to suffer because these companies don't want to pay higher salaries for American workers who would really help their customers.

After the cords were allowed to cool down, they no longer worked with my iPhone 5s.  Since I view this product as a fire hazard, or worst case - damaging my phone, I simply threw the 3rd one away, along with the other 2 useless cords."
1.0,To small
1.0,This arrived and it was smaller than I thought it would be - okay I can deal with that.  Then I used it and I actually really liked hot it felt on my wrist.  Then two days later the silicon junk started leaking out the bottom.  Clearly the top was not glued down properly.  What a piece of junk!  Do not buy this mouse pad you will regret it.
1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! I got two day shipping and it has now been I would say 6 days' yet still I do not have my tablet. also before I had bought another kindle and only had it for 6 months if that and it just stopped working on me. And they would not replace it. Mind you I had nothing to do with it from it stopping. This company sucks they are a fraud of a company!
1.0,"I don't kno what's the problem but it never worked.Had to order a charging stand,hope it's gone work."
1.0,"Garbage out of the box.  There is a reason that it runs so inexpensive - the cable is delicately thin and easily susceptible to internal breakage, which is likely what happened to mine.  Brand new, plugged it in, nothing...  Played with it a while assuming that it must be something I was doing until I just got a black screen.  Started over and used a more robust (but sadly shorter) VGA cable that I already owned to troubleshoot the situation; my own cable worked perfectly.  Back to the garbage I foolishly bought, again and still nothing.  Now I'm tossing it and saving up for a more expensive, more sturdy cable.<br /><br />The lesson learned here?  Most of this quick and cheap solution type stuff is garbage - quickly degrading, non-functioning, crap.  There is no easy cheap fix, just exercises in frustration.  You get what you pay for, and most of it is all trash off the line.  The best use of this particular cord might be to hang the person who designed it, but that's about it."
1.0,case is all I expected EXCEPT that it will not stay standing up as shown in this picture. What is wrong????
1.0,We returned it because it was to small to hold a 17' laptop.

1.0,"Let's start off with the one plus. Yes this keyboard can be washed. I've washed it in a dishwasher and I've submerged it completely in a sanitizing solution and it worked afterwards. That's the only positive thing I have to say about these keyboards though.<br /><br />This product is the Supreme poster child for terrible design. I think the people who designed this never once sat down and actually used their product.<br /><br />Where to start... the Home button is right next to the backspace button, so if you're used to a regular US keyboard layout then you're going to spend a lot of frustrating time getting used to the new layout, as the cursor moves where you don't want it to be and you erase perfectly good text. As if that weren't enough, they located the right trackpad button right where the heel of your right hand is when you use a natural hand position for typing. So if you use the \\""built in hand rest feature\\"", your right hand will push the button and your cursor will move to wherever you have it pointed to, which is almost invariably not where you want to be typing. The trackpad itself is too small for any real use and you'll find yourself begging the heavens for a mouse.<br /><br />And then there's the sticking keys. Out of the four keyboards that we tested, two of them have keys that stick down. One has a problem with the F1 button and another has a problem with the 4 key. Not only is it badly designed, it's also very badly made and I don't expect they would last very long under normal use. Not that I could bring myself to use one long enough to find out; its ability to resist the sudden deceleration of hitting a wall, or its ability to wistand the weight of a Freightliner truck, would get tested long before I ever washed it enough times to find out if it can withstand repeated washings.<br /><br />popped back up. See what i mean? Just for the record this sentence ws typed usimng the keyboard in question. The key spacing is all rong, and the comma key juststuck in the down position,, and now it [<br /><br />Maybe... MAYBE... if you work in the medical industry and type by pecking at the keys with two fingers... this might be worth your time and money... But if you're entertaining the idea of this as a work tool, one that has even the remotest link to the concept of productivity, you would do yourself and your company a great disservice by spending money on one of these."
1.0,"I do not usually write reviews, actually this is my first on Amazon.<br />I bought this one after reading many positive reviews here.<br />I was going to use it with Windows 10 to talk to Cortana instead of my Webcam mic and to use it to record high quality sounds as well.<br />But guess what:<br />1- you should talk to it directly to catch your sound, even when the volume control all way up (PC+Mic)<br />2- it has a very bad static noise (There is NO noise cancellation whatsoever)<br /><br />My webcam do a very much better than this one although it is connected to Asus Xonar sound card, I'm very disappointed<br />And As I live outside US I can't return this garbage, what a waste!"

Terrible item and a waste of my money! DO NOT purchase this item."

A wait of 20-80 seconds for a save and reboot each time I make a change on the router. What a frustrating exercise in futility!<br />3. Attempting to save a simple port forward saving forces router to reboot, and without saving the rule.<br />4. Mine has consistently dropped the Internet connection and is in some sort of reboot loop at the moment after attempting to save a port forward rule. Not cool!<br /><br />If I can get it to reset properly, I'll try DD-WRT on it to see if that helps. Otherwise, this will be an Amazon return."

1.0,"I really liked my earlier model, which broke after 14 months, now you have really screwed up with this model of Kindle. Some objections include: when accessing the list of already purchased books, you have to sift through the illegible &#34;book covers&#34; for the titles,  3-6 at a time, which are interspersed with &#34;recommended purchases&#34; which you can accidentally buy--since you can't read the title anyway on half of the &#34;book covers&#34; anyway. Seems a guise it encourage additional purchases, accidentally.  The efficient text listing of previously purchased books utilized on the previous model was MUCH better<br /><br />Also, any random touch on the device may change the page perhaps tens of even hundreds of pages ---and finding the original site where you left off is very cumbersome at best--IF you can find it without re-reading half a dozen chapters to see where you were<br /><br />There are also some other minor complaints, but basically, it seems you took a good device which was working well, and screwed it up !!!<br /><br />Also, in an apparent effort to manipulate customers into subscribing to the &#34;Kindle Unlimited &#34; deal, the prices on individual books purchased have abruptly and dramatically increased.<br /><br />So take my advice--if you have not purchased a Kindle, DON'T--stick with books."
1.0,Bubbles everywhere didn't stick good the first time already had to use second one. Doesn't perform as marketed

1.0,"Picked this up on sale.. doesn't work, only shows up as a 1MB (yes, Megabyte) card that I can'd do anything with.  I already threw away the original packaging too.  I'm sure returning it is going to be a huge PITA because of that.UPDATE: After writing this (albeit, short) review I found this is not uncommon.  I also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying ""The SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Card works with any microSDXC compatible device.""  That was all the motivation I needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced."
1.0,Not 15.6.
1.0,Didn't like the color and it wasn't as expected.
1.0,"I was looking for a case that my child could easily carry and that would protect the kindle from impact if she dropped it. That it does. Unfortunately, the case is extremely thick and the hole for the headphone very small, so it is almost impossible to plug them in. Also the buttons to turn it on and for volume are so hard to push that I have trouble doing it, so my little daughter stands zero chance no matter how hard she tries. So if you are OK with your kid not being able to turn the device on, adjust volume or plug in her headphones I guess this case might work for you. For me that kind of defeats purpose. And I go crazy trying to plug in the charger through the little whole in the thick case. Poor design in that regard. The impact protection is good, but other than that I find it disappointing."
1.0,"[UPDATED Jan 21, 2016]<br />I have many Seagate drives and will continue to buy them. But my particular experience with this 8TB drive bears reporting and is why I give it only 1 star.<br /><br />I bought 2 of these 8TB drives, here, in late March of 2015, brand new. One was for backup of the other. The drives were on a table top and never moved. The primary drive was used heavily most days, with many concurrent reads and writes, and synced up to the secondary drive at night. Both drives were safely detached and powered down each night, until used again.<br /><br />One morning last August 2015, when I connected the primary drive to my computer, Windows suddenly now says it is seeing a &#34;ASMT 2115&#34; USB Device. In Disk Manager, this drive shows 3 partitions, 1 raw and 2 unallocated -- instead of the single NTFS partition I had in place.  I've never ever seen this kind of thing before, but a google search did report that others have had a similar situation before with other Seagate drives, but the contexts were different from mine and in the end, I could find no definitive explanation or remedy. Neither could Seagate. A senior Seagate tech person  came on to my machine remotely and we tried a number of things but the result was the same: No explanation, no solution, the drive data is lost. I returned the drive and they sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />THAT WAS THE FIRST DRIVE. Now, 4 months later the 2nd drive from this same order, which I had since made the primary heavily accessed drive, fails to connect to my computer. Different problem from the first drive: This one shows up in Devices & Printers and Device Manager as Backup+ Desk, but does NOT show up at all in Disk Manager - so it's not an issue of it being offline. Again, Seagate sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />So those are the facts of my experience with this drive. It's probably and hopefully a very rare isolated problem.  The serial number of this drive shared the first 7 of 8 chars with thefirst drive, ending in &#34;R&#34; while the first one ended in &#34;Q&#34; so I assume they were manufactured at the same time. Seagate would not confirm, but I suspect there were problems with the earlier production runs of this 8TB drive and I got stuck with lemons.  For one thing --- Seagate does NOT normally ship NEW drives as replacements even in warranty.<br /><br />One other problem that costs a star in my rating is that this drive cannot be used to with Windows 7 system image creation. You get a I/O error early on in the process. The same with the Seagate 5TB drives."
1.0,"This drive was great, until it died. The power supply crapped out after a little over two years. A little research on the Internet showed that this is a common problem with this unit. The seller took several weeks to get back to me, then suggested I get a power supply on Amazon. I bought one and figured out how to install it (you better be handy to do this), and now it is back up and running. If this dies again, I am going to remove the internal hard drive and install it in a better drive enclosure.<br /><br />This was a great unit when it worked--it was easy to rip my entire CD collection onto the drive--but it simply isn't made for the long haul. I expected more for $450. Buyer beware."
1.0,"Windows 10 is NOT compatible with this Samsung 850 Pro 1TB Hard Drive. The Magician Software included and the Data Transfer software included are not recognized by the PC when you install the software programs. And the 1TB SSD itself is also not recognized by the PC! There isn't even a Letter that is assigned to the SSD when the connection is made with the recommended StarDust connection cable! The connection simply says &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; Even after manually assigning a Letter to the SSD, it is still identified as &#34;ASMT1051&#34; and doesn't work with the Data Transfer Software or the Magician Software. ... StarTech said in a comment that USB 3.0 powers only 900mA and is not compatible with all 2.5&#34; SSD units if they require more than 900mA of power. This Samsung unit says it uses 5 Volts and it also says 1.5A (1,500mA). The bottom line is that it truly is a disappointment that so many people are having this problem with the Samsung SSD units when working with Windows 10."
1.0,Totally devastated this card failed the very first time I used it. With irreplaceable images. Hours/days worth or work and destinations - all lost. Spent hundreds dollars to try to recover the images with no luck. Incredibly disappointed.
1.0,"Didn't work out of the box. I plugged it in and nothing, this has never happened to me with any router EVER! Therefore I guess this is not really a review but rather a warning to stay away from this product."
1.0,"Do not buy, card failed on the third usage.  Kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.Then, it's a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to Amamzon inLexington, KY.The failed card was in a GoPro White Edition. Needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in November is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back.  Card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of April.  6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.Out of all the items I bought from Amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro SD card is too much.  I'll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.Refund Update, once again Amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig.  Amazon is where I shop for 2 reasons.  1. I live 50 miles frombig box stores and 2. they ALWAYS make things right with no muss ...no fuss.I replaced the dead card with Amazon brand Micro 32 gig SD micro card.I have purchased Amazon branded SD cards before and they work just as good as any.Not to mention the cost savings."
1.0,None of them work. Not worth the buy
1.0,"The back portion doesn't properly attach to the back which means you can't stand up your device. In order to return it, I had to pry off the case with a friend bc it was such a hard fit. Not worth the money."
1.0,The charger broke the first time it was used!
1.0,In less than a month the screen showed a good side the other half very dull! Will be asking for a refund!
1.0,Too many scratches.
1.0,"Junk did not work at all, and never will due to plastic parts that snapped off"
1.0,"This was horrible. It came torn. Just out of curiosity, I tried to put it on to see if it was worth getting a replacement - it wasn't. It would've been way too loose to use."
1.0,After 24 hours of having this I am not happy with it. The key board constantly stops working followed by a USB driver malfunction. The memory is awful as if you have more than 2 apps running it bogs way down. Also my biggest complaint is it is advertised with 32gb of storage which is far from it. It has 23gb of storage and out of that only 12gb is available which makes upgrading to windows 10 impossible as 15gb is needed.
1.0,Sorry but these don't work reliably.  I have an iPhone 6 and these do that &#34;bing bing bing&#34; of going in and out of contact when plugged in.  Annoying.  I keep trying alternatives to paying full price for the Apple ones and so far I keep getting disappointed.  Don't waste your money on these.
1.0,"Had to return this item, it would not fit properly into the adapter that it came with.  Return was no problem, but I am reluctant to buy another one."
1.0,Overheated and died on first use. Total waste!
1.0,"I purchased this with high hopes, even after reading a review that will be similar to mine below.<br /><br />This is a great concept, but something is wrong with the execution. When I type on the keyboard, the trackpad randomly clicks. I wanted to love this item, but it is simply unusable. I am forced to return this, as the product is clearly defective. I've tried multiple orientations (trackpad on left/right), and nothing works."
1.0,Unable to unlock  Instructions very poor.  Would not recommend it to any one.
1.0,"Neither controller worked at all. They feel nice in the hand, but wont pair no matter what I try.  I will have to wait over a week for replacements to arrive. I will update review if new ones work."
1.0,Update: changing to 1 star. Case fell apart after only 1  year of light use. It seems like a knock off product. Glue is coming off separating the case making it useless. The case is also very stretched out creating a gap (see pic). I thought I was getting a great deal since my first apple case from the Apple Store died after 4 years and was used daily and twice the price. Little did I know this cheap knockoff case would barely last a year. What a rip off!
1.0,"after having little or no Internet service on this laptop I assumed it was Verizon's router. Had them change it twice to no avail. I canceled Verizon and had Comcast cable draw a line and hook me up. Even worse than Verizon. I called back Verizon (who were patient and understanding) and hooked up the original router. Then I tried two different signal boosters. Doing office work at home and losing Internet is frustrating to say the least. My son bought the same laptop a week before I did - he gave up on his months ago replacing it with an HP. I persevered. I never thought that it was the laptop. I bought a small Asus notebook to travel with and sat it next to my laptop and had 5 bars of signal. The Dell had noting but an icon spinning saying no Internet access. Now the laptop is out of warranty. I posted and Facebook and saw that hundreds or people were having the same issue.  After having me run diagnostic tests for two weeks Dell sent me a PM saying it was a bad wifi card, but the laptop is out of warranty. I asked their  &#34;out of warranty&#34; department to send me a new wifi card and I would pay to have it installed. They refused. A new wifi card is aobut $25. For that amount, Dell has seen my business for the last time. The laptop needs to be tossed out the window. Never Again!!!!!"
1.0,This is the worst product I have ever gotten from Amazon.  No customer support.  They will not return my calls.  The tablet stopped working after 90 days and no I get an email saying that the warranty is good for only 90 days.  Don't waste your money!!!!  One Star is too much for this piece of garbage!!!
1.0,Arrived as it was supposed to. However it doesn't work. My tablet wasn't that drained but its been plugged in for thirty minutes and there is no charge at all.
1.0,Seriously the worst laptop I've ever owned. I would recommend spending 100 dollars more to get something that actually works. It's VERY slow
1.0,The iPad case keeps unsnapping! it does not hold together well at all! I wish I would have went with another brand!
1.0,"DO NOT buy this monitor. There was crazy backlight bleeding 1 month into use but I decided to keep it. One year into use, I came to realize how bad the monitor really was. I had my ASUS ROG G75JW gaming laptop connected to the monitor through a HDMI cable when I heard a pop sound and both the monitor and laptop went out. I smelled smoke and checked all connections and found char marks on both connecting ends of the HDMI cable. The monitor was unresponsive and the laptop would not turn on either. I found char marks on the motherboard close to the HDMI port ASUS has REALLY bad quality control!"
1.0,"A month and a half after purchase...  My device powered off while the card was in use (batteries ran out).  Since then, doesn't work.  The device doesn't recognize it.  Doesn't respond to recovery, reformatting, partitioning... nothing.  I've used EaseUS, ZAR, HP USB Disk Format, and a couple others.  No dice.  Nothing can read it or fix it."
1.0,"Worked for a couple of days just like the first one I purchased from this seller. The screen is overly sensitive, causing the tablet operate on its own without touching it. Unfortunately, it's totally useless after two attempts at installing two different screens. Waste of time and money."
1.0,Does not work on Windows 10 or 7. No product support from their website. Can't find drivers...very disappointed. Tried on 3 different computers with no luck. Never had these kind of issues with a plug and play mouse. On the plus side it does look and feel nice.
1.0,worked for about 2 weeks. then it died.ordered a secondary one. that one didnt even work. So off to Dell i go to buy a replacement.
1.0,if you search the word &#34;Pesen&#34; you will notice that the seller was using another storefront until consumers discoverd this card is a counterfeit with half or less storage space. I did purchase and test this item and can confrim that it only has 40GB of usable space. Don't buy this product.
1.0,the space bar not responsive!
1.0,Lots of disconnecting issues and file system errors right from the start.  Can't even return it because it's impossible to erase the data that did get copied.
1.0,Didn't fit my tablet at all! Cheap!
1.0,"This keyboard absolutely does not work with Windows 10 tablets.  Windows connects and pairs with the keyboard successfully, but then immediately drops it and starts to reconnect again.  Downloaded new drivers, tweaked bluetooth and power settings, -- I even cleanly reinstalled Windows -- nothing works.  This is really surprising, since preview versions of Windows 10 have been available to hardware developers for a very long time (since 2014), so it never occurred to me that this would not support Win10... especially since it unambiguously advertises &#34;Compatible with the windows system Bluetooth-enabled tablets&#34; in the description.  On another sour note, this is a pretty bad implementation of keyboard functionality -- there is no page up or page down, for example.  They already have a Function (Fn) key on there, and it controls the media commands, so there is no reason not to include those basic features.  Sloppy.  As a final negative, the On/Off button is under the keyboard, very small, and actually really difficult to switch since it's recessed.  Other wireless keyboards have it on top and easily accessible, which is a just an obvious design choice that this keyboard gets completely wrong.  Wasted half a day on this.  It's going back."
1.0,I am going this product for now a 1 star as the motherboard showed up without the clamps for the memory!  Not much else but to question MSI's quality control methods as this seems like it would be a glaring item of note.  I saw it as soon as I took it out of the bag.  Very displeased because now I have to return to Amazon and then wait for the refund to credit to my account before buying another board.  Nothing like sitting your son down to put together his first real PC and have this happen.<br /><br />UPDATE:  My only option was to return for a refund.  Now the price has jumped from $136 to $175!!!  So much for buying it again.
1.0,"From the first day I got it out of the package, it didn't work. I tried it the next day and it worked. That was the ONLY time it worked. I gave it a few tries on different TVs and it just doesn't work."
1.0,Broke off in my PC within a week.
1.0,Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased.
1.0,They dont work well with apple products
1.0,"This laptop would not allow me to download anything, not even adobe.  Was not able to access the search engine &#34;Internet Explorer&#34;"
1.0,I purchased four (4) items from amazon and when I opened the box my 32gb memory card was missing. So rating this product is truly impossible
1.0,Was not told refurbished til lgot box it is slow and buttons font work well and programs that ce installed are slow. U can definitely tell. Would not do that again
1.0,"The clips which hold the battery are very flimsy and broke, so now the battery does not stay on."
1.0,"I get 50Mbps with direct wire but with one device wired through this switch the speed drops to 7Mbps. Not the direct pass through advertised. The barely-any-English Tech Support was difficult to reach, highly scripted, and less than helpful.  I will return for exchange of same product, still hopeful I got a bad unit.  I'll update this review after receiving replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: Replacement unit was comparable in poor performance to the first. In the end, I failed receive a product consistent with the product description, specifically: &#34;full wire-speed&#34;. It works, yes, but at 1/3 the speed of my wireless connection and 1/7 the speed of direct wire.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone who has other options."
2.0,"Worked fine for one week then one of the units got burned, ie, smell electrical burn and its LAN side did not work any more!!"
2.0,Get what you pay for. Would be great for traveling with kids and setting up wireless in a hotel
2.0,Will not connect with my wi-fi even when plugged in next to it.  Then it tries to become proprietary.  I have followed the directions in trying to connect it on several occasions and the result is always the same.

The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips.

2.0,It worked well for a couple of months and then out of the blue just stopped charging. What can I really expect though.
2.0,"colors not as vibrant as they appear in photo, a bit large for a true14 inch."
2.0,not comfortable to use and my mouse (which I ordered with the pad and was a recommendation) doesn't glide well.  I had to go back to traditional mouse pad.
2.0,Pretty cheap. I was rather disappointed in the quality of this item. I would rather have the access point exposed than use this. Returning.
2.0,"The disk is incompatible with older version of M.2 standard, because of DEVSLP and there is no warning about it. It disappeared after boot on my Lenovo y510p. I complained to ADATA, but I got a replacement instead of my money back, now I have to sell it myself.  UPDATE: I managed to run it by switching from AHCI to IDE (Compatible) mode in BIOS. I had edit registry for Windows not to crash and regenerate initramfs for Linux not to crash after that change. Also the read speed will be 1/3rd of the original, so that actually sucks."
2.0,it discharges too quickly
2.0,"This battery worked, but I had trouble getting it to stay attached to the clip (didn't seem to fit right) and the star screwdriver that came with it didn't fit.  Luckily I had a small phillips screwdriver that worked.  You may want to try another brand.  There are a couple of good videos on youtube showing how to take your Nook HD apart.  I highly recommend you review them before tackling this.  Keep the piece of tape from the old battery for reuse.  Using a guitar pick (sliding it around the cover) to separate the top works well."
2.0,"Looks nice...however, you need to modify 3 things for it to work properly. Being that it's $10, a) what'd you expect, b) it'd be a waste of time and money to send this thing back so I just modified it:<br /><br />1) There are 2 pins on the circuit board that are too long and are touching the case. This will cause your computer to not connect to the drive. Simple fix, bend those 2 pins down. 2) When connector plate is connected to the drive the connector plate is off center and will not close properly. Simple fix, shave one of the sides on the connector plate. 3) Since the connector plate is off centered, the screws are not aligned properly. Simple fix, widen the screw holes on the connector plate."
2.0,"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand."
2.0,"The tablet lags. Have to frequently restart. Applications get stuck. Still on Kit-kat. Updates come once a blue moon, wonder if there is a Dell dev team at all. Interface not customizeable. Bloatware not uninstallable. Camera is unusable, takes a good 3 seconds to capture a pic after click event.<br />Like the sleek design and HW solid build quality."
2.0,It didn't fit.
2.0,"This product would not work with my Dell Inspiron 1440. I was excited when it arrived, but when my computer went dead again I realized it had not been charging it. I then turned the computer back on and it said I needed an authentic Dell product. Sadly, I had to return it and will be spending the extra money for a Dell charger."
2.0,Heavy and prevents thumb print start up. Wish I had considered this purchase more.
2.0,This broke on my second day of using it.  I also purchased one for my IPad mini from a different company that has lasted 8 months now with practical daily use so I do not think it was something I did.
2.0,"Had to return, is NOT a wifi tablet but US Cellular unit and there is no US Cellular in our area, Had difficulties in getting wifi to work properly."
2.0,"I saw and demo-ed one of these in a local electronics store, and wanted one for about a year.  Finally, I decided to pull the trigger and buy one.  I thought it would be &#34;like an enormous iPad&#34; (since it is a touchscreen) that can also go on a stand and be a TV (for streaming videos and the like) and could also be used for Skype lessons.  At the same time that I purchased this Lenovo Horizon 2 27: All in One, my husband purchased a beautiful 27&#34; iMac and made fun of me for wanting the Lenovo.  In addition to the fact that the Lenovo was a touchscreen, the Lenovo was also less than half the price of the iMac and could easily be carried around or rolled around on a cart.  So when both products showed up at the same time, the computers were set up and my kids immediately flocked to the much more fun Lenovo.  That's where the fun ends.  Almost immediately, the &#34;Power On&#34; button on the side of the Lenovo got stuck in the frame of the computer.  No matter what we did (with tweezers, etc.) we couldn't get the button to come out - so the computer was in the constant state of being powered on - in other words, not working at all.  At this point, my kids had used the computer a handful of times, and I had not used it at all - we had had it for a few weeks.  Apparently, the warranty doesn't cover this type of issue (which is considered damage by owner, not a faulty part).  The numerous times I've tried to call Lenovo for help, they couldn't find the Serial Number in their database at all, so I couldn't register the warranty online or by phone.  I had to take the computer into a service center during which I waited in a LONGGGGGGG line on a Saturday during which several customers ended up &#34;going postal&#34; on the numb employees working there - screaming about how long they waited and about how someone calls them and says it's ready and then it's not...  After a couple of hours of waiting, my number was called, and the person helping me said that the stuck &#34;ON&#34; button was not covered under warranty, but they would request that the problem be covered as an exception.  We had zero confidence that the exception would be granted.  We left the the Lenovo, original box and packaging and cord with a strong sense that we'll never see it again - it was like dropping it into a black hole (completely disorganized place).  The couple of tissue paper like forms that they left with us had no details (like that the computer had been left there with the original box and power cord), and I was forced to sign something that says &#34;I hereby acknowledge that the damage was due to my personal negligence...&#34;  It's been several weeks, and after waiting a LONGGGGG time on the phone line when calling the well-kept-secret phone number of the service center, I'm left on hold when someone finally picks up the line and/or I can't get anyone to pick up the line to see what the status is of the computer.  At this point, I'm willing to just pay for someone to pry out the ON button.  My husband keeps giving me this knowing I-told-you-so look.  Drives me crazy when he's right!"
2.0,"Worked fine for about a month and now the keys are not responding well, if at all. Reinstalled and checked the cable but it didn't help. I'll spend a bit more on the next one."
2.0,"This mouse is brand new and already malfunctioning. It works great at first, but if I walk away from my computer for a few minutes and then come back, the mouse doesn't work anymore! I have to turn it off and on again to get it to work. SO ANNOYING and disruptive."
2.0,"I am a huge fan of Steel Series. But these ruined my 5 star history with them. I used the Steel Series V2 for years and had 2 headsets and even gifted them to friends and streamers based on how highly I thought of them. So like a naive consumer, I figured the V3s would be an ever better experience.<br /><br />Three weeks in, the poorly glued adjusting band came apart, leaving a floppy faux leather strip constantly whipping against my head when I removed them. Then I a problem developed in voice chat across many software platforms (skype, teamspeak, steam chat and mumble) where people could hear the sounds from my headphones in the call. I am not sure if this is a faulty internal thing where the mic is too sensitive, but there is not a setting that has allowed me to prevent this.<br /><br />Everything about the V3s has felt inferior to the V2s, the cushion adjustable head band, gone. The quality of separate line audio/mic, gone. The convenient and secure Mute button on the line, not gone, but on the headset, which means fumbling against my head to make sure I am muted."
2.0,I'm sure it was good tabelt but screen arrived all discolored and static so I was unlucky
2.0,"Keyboard works fine, the but there is no lightning cable pass through to connect other devices, especially a charger while the keyboard is connected.  As there appears to be no such thing as a lightning hub or splitter, I'm stuck swapping this Macally keyboard out with power or computer connections.<br /><br />Move on and pick a keyboard that supports lightning cable passthrough."
2.0,"I really can't recommend this drive. It is REALLY NOISY. I couldn't count the number of DVD drives I've owned or used over the years, but what I do know, is that this is the noisiest drive I have ever used. I am going to replace it, it is so noisy. I bought an ASUS DVD drive several years ago, and it was quiet. Recently I had been using Samsung Super WriteMaster drives, but they had a high failure rate. The ASUS drive I bought years ago also failed, but since I had only tried one, and was otherwise happy with it, I decided to give ASUS another try. Unfortunately ASUS quality and engineering capability have regressed. This drive is junk."
2.0,"1. The ribbon was not included while they claim that they do include one with the keyboard. Luckily, I managed to remove the one from my defective keyboard. Since Dell glues it, it is a very risky operation as it could be damaged in the process of being un-glued<br />2. Please pay very close attention to the picture. If you compare your keys with this keyboard, you will notice some significant differences. For example, the left shift key is narrower and the * key on the numeric pad is replaced by the x key. Since Excel uses the * in the formulas, this can be an issue.<br />3. They say it is brand new, yet, I noticed a paint chip when I un-packed it. Sounds more refurbished than new."
2.0,Still cannot use this with my automobile test app that originally uses the old iPhone 3 style plug
2.0,Had problems with the unit and sent it back.  Fast refund of funds.  Found a similar unit new for a little more.
2.0,"I had to go back to the &#34;universal&#34; charger because my laptop told me immediately, this charger was insufficient. I bought this so it would charge the new battery correctly and not ruin it, but using it would ruin the battery much, much sooner."
2.0,"I'm giving 2 stars because reliability of this router is bad for a high end product.<br /><br />I've had this for about 1 year and it works as you would expect most of the times... high speed, long range, etc. Sadly it cannot handle multiple devices using some bandwith concurrently for too long. I've noticed this since I started streaming Xbox one to my W10 PC while also watching streams in HD in multiple devices. The router seems to just not be able to handle the work,  everything communication dies for about 10 seconds in every device i have attached and then it comes back to life on its own.<br /><br />I've also had intermittent issues connecting devices to this router, for some reason it just doesn't allow them to connect at all until I power reset it.<br /><br />Yes, I constantly check for firmware and software updates, they haven't helped.<br /><br />I would recommend to people that are looking for a high end router to look somewhere else, this guy will fail you when you most need it for its supposed high end capabilities."
2.0,"The battery needed to be charged be I could use it. Also, it was difficult recharging the battery"
2.0,App is useless won't read its own file format doesn't do half the stuff it's supposed to
2.0,Mine developed a short after a few months. You get what you pay for
2.0,The case is fine.  The color is more of a burnt orange..
2.0,"As for the description its great and matches up with everything perfectly for the most part. The problem is when gaming for periods of time this isn't able to withstand the heat output even with the fan manually at 100 pct the entire time. the fact that the card is also overclocked and that a person will not be able to lower it will create issues with certain games, Call of Duty Advanced War being one of those games as the game has an issue with overclocked graphics cards.<br /><br />My purpose was to spend a bit less money than needed and hope to get something that can keep up, although I now have a graphics card which I want nothing more than to get rid of this and spend the extra $100 to get something much nicer"
2.0,Bought it in July and just passed my return date it has been giving me problems. Various issues are the pointer will drag to the bottom by itself. Second is having to click on mouse several times before it recognizes you pressed it. It's a pretty expensive mouse to be giving me these problems.
2.0,"It cracked after 3 weeks of use. Great color, not so great quality. I had expected more from Speck."
2.0,It is definitely not for 15.6&#34; I have dell 7000 series and it did not fit the whole screen. it is short vertically as well as horizontally.  it is more like 13.3'.
2.0,"I ordered this memory card because, obviously i needed more space on my phone. One of the reasons why I prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android. My memory card arrived when I expected it to and now I have more than enough space on my galaxy S4....... I once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when I was satisfied with it. But now I'm having problems. I can't delete stuff of of the sd card. I tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now I'm giving it a two star."
2.0,The cover started to come apart in a week. Little duct tape and it will never fail now.
2.0,"Looks functional,  but did not fit my 17 inch Dell laptop. Was able to get most of the laptop in,  but one corner was sticking out no matter how hard I tried to push him. Had to send it back"
2.0,cheaply made
2.0,The bottom part of the case isn't very secure.  Update: Started cracking after about 2 months
2.0,"Decent, but forgets configuration after power loss."
2.0,"+ 5 stars for being a great case.<br /><br />-3 stars for not specifying that the all the threads are metric. God forbid I live in the greatest nation on earth and need a case the uses 'merican units.<br /><br />Seriously, though, you cost me a lot of time, money, and effort trying to mount my current equipment with UTS standard screw sizes on a metric case. These are elementary specs you need to specify.<br /><br />Edit: I should also say that it didn't come with any screws, so it wasn't a simple matter of switching the screws out. If they had included mounting screws, I probably wouldn't have had so many problems."
2.0,Seems like the magnet is not strong enough
2.0,"Great hardware design, terrible OS and App Store make it frustrating to use.  Battery not great."
2.0,"The adhesive strip keeps falling off after only 2 days. I followed instructions to the letter, and even cleaned them according to insert."
2.0,"Bought this to use in my Samsung SIII as it was supposed to be a fast card. Worked fine until it totally died after less than a year of very little us due to the design of the SIII. Phone popped up a message that the SD card had been removed (it hadn't). Nothing I did to the phone brought the card back up. Removed it and tried it in my laptop (Win7) and other computer (XP Pro) and it is totally dead, neither will even recognize its in the drive. Working with Sandisk to get a replacement, they want all kinds of fairly useless information, will see if I get an RMA number and replacement card.This is the first memory card I have ever had fail.As an update, warranty service from Sandisk has proven to be non-existent. They first asked to have over 16 questions answered, then mysteriously lost all the answers I sent back, three times."
2.0,"Still just as slow and glitchy as the first edition fire. Still not flash compatible which renders the browser useless. Freezes constantly, crap battery life and regularly occuring issues with loading the page you were on last.  Incredibly disappointing."
2.0,"I bought this for my son instead of the mini iPad. I have to say it's difficult to use. Storage is always full, locks up continuously and so many dang ads. Just to delete an app is ridiculous. I really had high hopes for this. Only good for reading books, Hulu and Netflix."
2.0,Nice but really really slow
2.0,Used it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet.  Stopped working after about 10 months without warnings.  My tablet now recognizes as blank or un-formatted card; my computers won't even recognize it at all!  I am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card...
2.0,Great for about 2 weeks.  Started to smell like burning plastic and got really warm.
2.0,"These speakers are pretty bad. The sound quality is not good at all. I'm considering returning them, but I don't think it's worth the  effort or cost."
2.0,I had had this drive in my computer for a while an though it was an overrated regarding how fast SSD boot up until I replaced the SanDisk with Samsung SSD.  That was night and day I found out.  Never buy SSD from this company anymore.
2.0,"I bought two of these Memory Cards for use with my Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera's. So far, I have found them to be unreliable. I am not entirely certain if this is because of the Camera system or the Memory Card themselves. The camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted. This is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important, the failure of the SD card would be very troublesome indeed."
2.0,"Like these at first - sturdy, colors are nice, good length, and they worked (at first).  Now they will no longer charge - not &#34;compatible.&#34;"
2.0,"It is as described, WIn8 mini pc. However, you need to uninstall a security program and delete a user account to be safe. Also the biggest fault after an hour or so of streaming HD media it begins to overheat then you get clipping. I will try a wireless usb adapter to see if that helps but may not. I'd recommend spending more and get one without a metal housing like this. Spend the extra $50-100 it will be worth it. Also the plugs on this are mini to full size -- for example the HDMI connector. It comes with cables but they are not that secure & could easily be broken on the pc side. Again spend a little more and get a nicer PC that will be more durable.<br /><br />I have tried a heat sink on top of the pc but it doesn't help much. Hilarious the heat sink looks like a monster on this little pc."
2.0,Not bad but the i-pad 2 has a camera
2.0,Headphones broke during the first use. The black mesh part came off and it was impossible to put it back on.
2.0,"Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card's speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace...."
2.0,"HERE IT IS PEOPLE:<br />Terrible CAP LOCK FEATURE, a light flickers briefly to notify you of it being on or off.<br /> (and many times you can not tell if it is on or not.)<br /><br />The keypad seem to not respond as good as it should."
2.0,doesnt usually work on win 7 or win server 2012
2.0,It's very flimsy.
2.0,Sound terrible anytime volume is tuned further than 1/2 way up.
2.0,i don't like it
2.0,"The product is a lot bulkier and bigger than it looks compared to the pictures. Since it is so big and bulky, it can cover up some of your ports on the side of your laptop. It does not stick on very well and it is constantly falling off when you are carrying your laptop elsewhere. It is very annoying. It is only good when you have your laptop set on the table. If it only mount better onto the laptop, then the size would not matter as much. The vacuum is quite loud when turned on fully max. The plus side is that it does indeed cool downs your laptop tremendously. It does a better job than a cooling pad."
2.0,Didn't fit my husband's truck. Size a bit misleading
2.0,Quite possibly the poorest quality item I've ever purchased.<br />wasnt cut out properly. Wouldn't separate from the paper backing. Ripped in several places. Filled with bubbles.
2.0,"Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.  I have purchased aelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)to use the 64GB MicroSDHC card as a thumb drive."
2.0,"Cheap stuff.  The older reviews here clearly aren't for the same product that I purchased since mine has no port covers and isn't waterproof.  This item is cheap plastic, has no instructions or warranty, and the stand flops around like a dog's tail when you pick up your tablet."
2.0,"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing."
2.0,"The case is cracking everywhere and all 4 of the corners have chipped off. I am extremely careful with my macbook, as I bought it with my own money. So I know that it isn't from me throwing it around or anything. I would not repurchase."
2.0,Does not hold my iPad in constantly falling out
2.0,The shift key placement on the right side is absolutely horrific. I'm always pressing pg up instead. Avoid this if you touch type. Get the updated version!
2.0,"Unresponsive, too small to be comfortable."
2.0,"The original charger that came with my MacBook was made in Japan, had the Apple logo on it, and also says &#34;Apple Japan&#34; on the side.  This charger is a slightly different size, and the wall plug attachment fits differently.  Although this product has worked for the past several weeks, I do NOT consider it a &#34;Genuine Apple&#34; product.  It also runs a little hotter than my original charger.<br /><br />It works so far and cost only $34, so I'm giving it two stars."
2.0,"Item was good for a while but all of a sudden my computer started blue screen memory dumping, then restarted itself and said boot disk could not be found. I reinstalled original HDD and the problem went away."
2.0,Never could get it to work properly
2.0,"Fan itself (motor, bearing, and blades) works great. Frame is a great idea, but...not so durable. Be careful when handling, and don't separate the rubber pins, you'll never get it back together. I'd have returned it but I tossed the boxes for them, so the fan got tossed too. Oh well. To replace them I bought the same brand but regular solid frame. Should have in the first place."
2.0,The arm broke 2 weeks into using this.<br />Not enough reinforcement and now it occupies a space in my &#34;unused&#34; computer peripherals.<br />Just a gimmick and not worth the money.
2.0,Sounds is muffledeven after hours of tweeking
2.0,Not a good product. Purchased it because of the look and usb dongle less feature but it is a troublesome device. Doesn't work with windows 7 at all! Connected to Macbook air (yosemite) but I have to search and connect it every time I reboot! Microsoft should provide appropriate drivers for this mouse to get it working with most devices. Even there is no help or support information for this product in the web. Better look for any other device with similar feature.
2.0,"8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work."
2.0,I used this while I was a student in college. With heavy usage on my laptop the case broke down fairly quickly. First things to go were the small pieces of plastic that hold the case onto the laptop. I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,The laptop was great while it worked. After less than a week the screen stopped powering on completely. The internals themselves were fine but the screen just gave up.
2.0,"Bubbles, bubbles bubbles.  I can't get rid of them.  Easy to install, but lots of bubbles."
2.0,"The case is a replacement for one I bought a few years ago and it is the same quality, however the screen saver that they sent is half the size of the screen."
2.0,It glitches alot as in it will turn in to a white screen but it ends up working and to day the on \off button pushes in and became loose so its nearly impossible it and sometimes it  opens apps Randomly and starts to glitch when typing
2.0,"Barely lights my full-tower case at all.  Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it does work, but offers very limited lighting."
2.0,Battery doesn't last as long as reported and goes to sleep and won't come back on  until you place it in cradle to wake it back up.
2.0,After exactly month and a half this card is done...and with it i lost all my pics and videos...just after the return policy expired!! card is not recognized by my phone or PC. Trying to get RMA from Sandisk...I own the S3 and have read extensive problems with the 32 and 64gb card class 10! Samsung says is Sandisk...and Sandisk says is the phone ??? But i've seen other cards failing with different phones! All Android by the way...What's the problem ?
2.0,"I purchased this iPad Air 2 case about 9 months ago in gray.  I initially liked almost everything about it, especially the transparent hard plastic back that revealed the Apple on the back of the iPad.  The magnet is strong and works well for wake/sleep.  It has a soft inside cover with simple lines, low profile.  Today a piece of plastic dropped off a corner of the hard clear plastic back.  When I examined it more closely, I noticed cracks on all the corners and that now the case can barely hang on to the iPad.  I'm glad the plastic fell off so I could discover the problem before the iPad dropped entirely out of the case onto the floor.  This case has had light use and no abuse so I think it should have endured much longer.  I had purchased a different brand case for my husband's iPad Mini at the same time.  It has a &#34;rubberized&#34; back and is still functioning and looks great.  I don't like the appearance as well as the Yippee Color Series, but it's obviously more durable.  I'll try that next."
2.0,"I had this product for one week before the auxiliary cable stopped working properly and now the Microlab speakers only work if I keep the cable in a certain position. The clip-on is shallow and has poor grip which makes it loose, wobbly, and slip easily. Requires a USB and a headphone jack, when there are similar products that only require one of these to be occupied. When the speakers work, the audio can be loud but the quality is mediocre."
2.0,"I've had 2 of these speaker systems in the last 5 years, and now I'm going to Logitech or Creative. The speakers and sub sound great, amazing in fact, but the problem is with the controller pod. Seems the pot doesn't last more than 2 years or so. One of the speakers will quit working...press down on the blue lighted center of the pod and great sound. Let it go, and one speaker dies. As I said, the speakers are fine, it's in the pod. Take note C/A, fix that crappy pot and you've got a great little system for 30 bucks."
2.0,Very frustrating packaging. I broke the sd card trying to open it up. If you use scissors carefully then it shouldn't be a problem.
2.0,Wasn't a fan of this case! Replaced it right away. Looked too cheap.
2.0,Not so &#34;heavy duty&#34;. After a month only one of them is working. That didn't cost as much as the others but it would have been nice if they had lasted longer.
2.0,"I want to love this unit, but it just would not work properly for me. I bought this to replace a Nighthawk X6 R8000 and a Motorola Modem and I had nothing but problems with it. 1) I could not successfully get a device I needed to forward ports to to work properly. Since I have a Nighthawk, I know my way around Netgear's firmware - so I knew exactly what to do. The AC1900 just would not work properly. According to the unit's UI I had it set up properly - alas, I could not get it working.<br /><br />With the Nighthawk X6 R8000 port forwarding worked perfectly.<br /><br />2) My Sonos system (which is hard wired into my network) kept stopping.<br />The stream(s) would just quit. With the Nighthawk I would run audio for DAYS without any interruptions. Not so here.<br /><br />I thought ok, maybe I need to update the firmware - guess what?<br /><br />You can't. Because it's a combo device, Comcast needs to certify / release any new firmware. You know what that means right?<br /><br />They're never going to to do. They have no incentive.  They don't care.<br /><br />I like that I was able to to future proof my cable modem speeds, but not at the incredible expense of network that would not work properly AND firmware that most likely will never be upgrade.<br /><br />Very sad."
2.0,"This mouse is an extremely cheap mouse. It has no heft to it, it feels like a plastic box, and it would break very easily.<br /><br />It works fine, and the range is accurate.<br /><br />I'm definitely getting a mouse that is much more expensive than this in the future."
2.0,"this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them."
2.0,The class ten card failed and jamed my phone a KYOCERA RISE : it was replaced with another regular H D 32GB SanDisk card and is working fine. The micro SDHC CARDS are 1/3 less in price than they used to be and are a best buy by far.Your Music PalJoe Mal
2.0,"I bought this case to protect my surface pro. I had it for maybe, two or three weeks, and the surface pro is already on it's way back to Microsoft (costing me $350 to repair) becuase the screen is shattered.  Now, I did trip in a parking garage. I'm also 5 foot tall. My surface pro was inside this case, inside a bag on my shoulder, that also contained my cell phone, my ipad, and my ipod. The only item that was damaged was the surface pro. To say I'm a bit dissatisfied with the amount of &#34;protection&#34; it provides, is an understatement.  The most sensitive area on a tablet or electronic with a screen is the corner. It's the only part that isn't protected at all.  If you are using the case just for looks, it does it's job. If you're using the case to actually protect your surface pro, I wouldn't spend a dime on it."
2.0,Pretty garbage. Slower and less powerful than even the one that comes with the phone. Had gas station chargers better than this.
2.0,Stop working after a week😡
2.0,"I don't love this. It looks nice but it doesn't stand up great, it's pretty heavy and awkward for me.  I will use it for now but probably replace it eventually.  I wish I would have kept looking but it's hard to tell exactly what the problems are from just a picture.  Oh well....lesson learned."
2.0,Great
2.0,"very flimsy, wouldnt recommend it"
2.0,I thought this cover had a screen protector too when it is labeled as a full body protector. It does not.
2.0,"It is a micro usb cable. That's about it.<br /><br />But the cables seem to low capacity and take forever to charge. I previously used Anker's micro USB cable which had worn down over time. I have had good success with Amazon's micro USB 3.0 cable, but this seems to be quite different. I regrettably have moved back to Anker for this particular cable."
2.0,"Had alot of connectivity issues, causing me to have to detach and reattach the cover, but the extra battery boost is nice. the track pad is terrible"
2.0,"The offset is off by at least 3-4mm. I bought mine earlier today, had free same day shipping, used it for 2 hours to take notes, it drove me nuts, repackaged it and sent it away for a return. Definitely do not recommend this product for a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2; I also used it on my Galaxy Note 3, same deal, offset is off. It also appears very hesitant. I feel I have to press extra hard to use it. Oh - and it feels bulky. I prefer the 'toothpick&#34; that comes with the device after having had used this joke of a product."
2.0,"When it works, the speed is fine, but what's really frustrating is that every few minutes the USB connection fails, saying the device malfunctioned and Windows did not recognize it, and it either returns after a few seconds, or I have to unplug it and put it back in."
2.0,I like the contrasting color and the magnetic closer. It is already showing wear around the corrners.
2.0,sparks when pluged in is unsafe to use
2.0,"I bought mine the other day and it came in the mail quickly. I immediately liked it, although the end (the touch screen part) is not attached to anything. It is literally a microfiber tip attached to a little plastic screw that is too small to screw into the part it is suppose to. I would return it, but I don't have time to wait around for another one, so I bought some superglue and glued the little thing to where it was suppose to screw in. I would not buy this again, as the very first one I got was defective."
2.0,"This is a terrible laptop. I would not recommend that anyone buy it. The trackpad is a total joke. I get so frustrated that it hardly ever works. I now exclusively use a wired mouse with it in order to use laptop. It does have a fast start up, but that's probably because I am too scared to download anything to slow it down anymore once running. Seriously, for a supposed &#34;chromebook killer&#34; it starts to run slow and lag if I have more than 2 tabs open. And I know it's not the Internet because I have 16mb.<br /><br />Cons- needs a secondary mouse to function, slow, can't keep up with Internet websites, little internal hard drive space<br /><br />Pros- awesome blue color, very lightweight, fast start up, free Microsoft trial, 100GB of cloud storage"
2.0,Product works well and was delivered on time. Only issue is that the mouse misses one of the optical sensor (bent b shaped) pads.
2.0,"Would be cool, except this thing can't handle HD youtube video.<br /><br />The Battery life is fantastic.  The simplicity is great, the speed of the machine for simple tasks like email and stuff is all good.<br /><br />But this machine simply CANNOT play youtube videos.  Its just a matter of graphics processing.  Watching a youtube video in 1080p at  is not possible on the samsung chrome book.  This really is disappointing because I LOVE THIS THING outside of this massive short fall.  I think I might have to return it which is really disappointing...<br /><br />If you are watching a video that is mainly dark, it handle it for the most part but as soon as the scene changes and a lot of light textures are shown on screen the video will become choppy and broken.  Its a shame, but it renders this Samsung Chrome book virtually useless for me... its a damn shame."
2.0,"I purchased this product for my Janome sewing machine. Unfortunately, it is not compatible and I never got to see if it worked.  So if you are going to get this for a sewing machine keep in mind that storage is not everything and machines that require a CF probably have incredibly slow processors and the 16 GB will freeze your machine. Try something like 32 MB."
2.0,Mostly unecessary accs. that most of us have already
2.0,Pro's:<br />Super easy to setup. Under Windows 8+ it's just plug and play.<br /><br />Con's:<br />The range on this is a joke. I live in very small apartment (600&#62; sqft) and my wifi router sits in one corner. My desktop is in the opposite corner and I'm lucky to get even one bar.
2.0,I have three kids and was looking for a new case for their iPad. I have another case that we've been very happy with (the iGuy) so I had something to compare to. This case was VERY hard to get on. The material felt more flimsy than I expected. I'm sure it's a decent shock absorber but I didn't even give my kids a chance to use this one because I don't trust the stand either. My rating is probably lower than it would be if I didn't have another case designed for kids that was significantly better. I would check out the iGuy before this one.
2.0,it does not say affixed or in position.<br />I wanted because it appeared it could easily be put on and taken off regularly.<br />That has not worked out. it bows in the middle or falls of and makes using the touch screen awkward or impossible.
2.0,Ok
2.0,"Feels very cheap and the graphics are poor, which I should have known by the price.  I ended up ordering a Samsung galaxy and giving this to my 2 yr old neice."
2.0,"The people posting five star reviews after owning this for a week should be ashamed.  This is a 2-3 star product at best.<br /><br />Advertised at 199 and then an absurd percentage &#34;off&#34; is misleading. It is a $60 tablet selling for $55-60. I got a lightning deal last thanksgiving and at $47 i wish i had returned it. But i kept running into issues with the cord not plugging in all the way so it wouldnt charge and it has sat forgotten for multiple stretches of weeks.  Finally figured out you need to peel the cover back to get a good connection, which means the cover should have had a slightly bigger hole.  It takes about 6-8 hours to charge and lasts about 2-3 hours, way less if you have wifi on. So if downloading something, plug it in first. And dont download two things at once, or try and play and download at the same time. It says dual core but my guess is it is sporting some old processor and a cheap battery.<br /><br />If you have the patience for downloading slowly and one at a time, and want to limit tablet time to a few hours, and need an inexpensive tablet with a very sturdy rubber case, this is not a bad deal. So it gets 2-3 stars. But anyone giving it more than that is stretching the truth. Or have kids breaking their $100-200 tablets...<br /><br />A perfect example, charged overnight, son played it this morning while trying to update two apps and download two games, so with wireless on battery was at 9%. After having to redownload one and find the other after a frustrating search to figure out where it downloaded to but didnt install. Charging for an hour now, its at 17% and that is with wireless off..."
2.0,I've been trying to connect to WiFi for an hour since I received my device. It picks up every network in my building other than mine. Cool product.
2.0,"terrible. Bulky and the tab that holds the edge of my iPad bent. Seeing that it is cardboard underneath fake leather, there is nothing I can do to fix it."
2.0,Cable failed
2.0,Storage is so limited as to make the unit all but useless except to read books.
2.0,This productt needs another part that is not included to work
2.0,"Compatibility problems with Mac Mini 2094.  I purchased it with external power supply.  Mac mini would go to sleep and shut down.  Removed external power supply and it worked normality.  Apparently this is a common problem with USB 3.0 hubs and Macs.  Mac mini now starts automatically when I plug it in when using this hub even when it is unpowered.  I may have to give up on it.<br /><br />Other than that... Looks good, and moves a lot of data."
2.0,"Primarily chose this product for the noise cancelling mic for online vid calls like goog hangout, VSee, etc.: but it actually makes your voice &#34;robo-echo&#34; as co-workers told me. I suspect there's feedback using the Mac's &#34;Use ambient noise control&#34; feature, but not sure. [Will search the review posts/product questions to double-check. Will update the review with anything useful.]<br /><br />Anyways, the product isnt working for me. I almost wish that I'd order the new Apple Earbuds instead..."
2.0,The tabs break off very easily.  I had a 20% failure rate on my home patch panel.  Spend a little more for better quality.  It's not worth the hassle.
2.0,"I ordered it but the main bag is different from the bag in the picture. I'm really disappointed. It still looks ok, but I was expecting a bag with a flap and 2 pockets. I didn't get any of that."
2.0,Good. Wasn't actually what I wanted.
2.0,good price but low quality for music
2.0,"It didn't work. Yeah it's cool to look at, but it didn't last more than 2 months"
2.0,I have only had it since April and it's now August and the left clicker is already sticking and difficult to push.
2.0,The fan fail after 5 months of the original purchase day.
2.0,It was good for a week till the rubber  starting falling off in big strips
2.0,I Wipl be reviewing my friends<br /><br />It is build like a tank<br />An lot con is the command key has to be corrupt glued
2.0,it shard to put on and it makes squeaky noises because the hard plastic is rubbing on the hinges.
2.0,Over all for music files it wasn't bad but once I started saving my video and pictures on it it created corrupted files. My whole Disneyland and six flags vacation  was unreadable. Huge disappointment
2.0,"It was very easy to set up, though the instructions could use some grammar fixes.  I do have quite a few problems with it keeping the connection to the main router.  I have to constantly unplug and re-plug it in to sometimes get it to work again.  Most of the time it says I have internet when I'm connected to it, but I don't.  When it is working, it works great, but it's spotty at best.  Even as I type this I have to change to the main router, for which I only have 1 bar of signal, which is why I bought this in the first place.  The other problem I'm having with it is once it is set up with the SSID and password, I can no longer access the GUID to change any settings.  The only way I can is to do a factory reset and do everything over again.  I've done this 3 times now just to see if there's a setting I'm missing so it will keep a connection to the main router.  Nothing seems to work.  I will try swapping it out with a new one and will update when I receive the replacement."
2.0,"I like the flat design, but this is not for use with video.  I bought this to use with a pair of  HDMI extenders for a projector. Dropped a lot of pixels, leaving white edges on video.  Replaced with a Cat7 cable and all is well.  7/3/17: Finally surrendered the long video run after the CAT7 failed within a few months. Rewired to put entertainment within 25ft of projector and we are back to working. No problems in the last 3 months."
2.0,"Bought this because new cable modem provided by Comcast seems to have a weaker WiFi output as I can no longer get a reliable signal from upstairs.  Put it in upstairs hallway, now I get a great signal in the hallway, but almost non existent in any of the rooms upstairs.  Looking to return this product."
2.0,It still has a bad smell and the inside pads peeled out. Had to use some gorilla glue to fix them. I just use it as a fishing lure box.
2.0,Not best fit but it worked out.
2.0,"I should have let the price - instead of the other ratings - be my guide. The case looks and feels cheap: the rubber outer is too large and constantly coming off after just a few weeks of use. The kickstand is flimsy and gets in the way. You can't feel the volume toggles and have to search for the slightly raised buttons. Worst yet, you can barely reach the iPad's ports and buttons due to the strange way the cutouts are laid out. It's big and pink, which is what my daughter likes. It's cheap, which is what I like. Still, I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,one  of  the  new  gadgets  that  promises  way  more  than  it  delivers.  content  hard  to  access  and  really  is  only  a  weblinker.  Close  to  worthless  item
2.0,I was very disappointed with my kindle. I bought it so I could read my college ebooks and the Kindle doesn't support the books. I haven't decided if I want to keep it for my fun books. I'm not happy that my Kindle ebook doesn't work with a brand new kindle.
2.0,"I've unfortunately either had really bad luck with this version of Kindle, or it's not as nice as the previous versions.  I recently purchased the Voyage in June 2015, only to have it freeze and quit working not even 2 months later.  Amazon support was very helpful (I used online chat) and I received a &#34;new&#34; Kindle only a few days later.  I just downloaded a few new books to read, only to notice before I could even use it that the top plastic &#34;lining&#34; is ripping off! I've heard rumors they send you refurbished products as replacements.... I'm not sure if this is true, but if it is I'm extremely disappointed.  I just noticed this defect and have not contacted Amazon yet.  Once I do, I hope I am replaced a THIRD time with a brand new, defect free, Kindle Voyage.  I do have to say I have not had the yellow discolored issue as other readers have noticed. Mine just don't work and fall apart lol."
2.0,"This monitor works fine for movies and games, but text on this monitor is not very crisp.  I would not recommend it if you do a lot of reading on your computer."
2.0,Doesn't run as fast as expected or advertised even with a direct hard connection
2.0,"I really didn't want to give this thing a bad review.<br /><br />If you're buying this keyboard for the pretty colors, then it's the right keyboard for you.  The colors, patterns, key reactions and brightness are all fully customizeable for all keys, groups of keys or even the individual key itself.  It color cycles.  It pulses.  It does 'the wave'.  You can program it to do just about anything.  Now, making a cool color combination can be a little tedious, but if you're determined and creative you can make your keyboard flash like a disco.  Sometimes it doesn’t load the right profile, or it forgets what profile was loaded and defaults to something you didn’t want.  In fact, as I type this, Razer Synapse has stopped working, and that’s the interface that lets you control the pretty colors.  But when it does work, the colors are really amazing.<br /><br />But unfortunately, you may have to use this keyboard for typing and/or gaming, and that's where it falls short.  The keys are no more or less comfortable than other keyboards.  The clicks are a little loud but not noisome (if you think you’ll be bothered by the clicking noise I encourage you to find one in a store somewhere and hear for yourself).  It does function as advertised.<br /><br />Sometimes a key will get stuck.  If you're lucky, only thissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss will happen.  But sometimes the BACKSPACE key gets stuck, and you get to watch just how quickly the cursor deletes every word you just wrote.  And sometimes it's an arrow key, and instead of turning your video game spaceship to aim at the enemy spaceships, you just start spinning uncontrollably.  This to me is a fatal flaw.  This should not occur on a keyboard I bought just a few months ago.  I don't abuse this keyboard, I don't press the keys very hard and all my previous keyboards worked fine for years and years.<br /><br />Another irritating feature is that while the letters and numbers are backlit, the shift characters are NOT.  So at night you can look down and see 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but you have to kind of think about which one is !, @, #, $ or %.  Same with : &#34; &#60; &#62; ? { } | _ and +.  This may seem minor and I kind of knew it when I purchased it, but I had no idea how much that would annoy me.<br /><br />There is an indicator to see if caps lock, num lock and scroll lock are on, but they're so dim you'll never notice them.  You can see them if you look at the keyboard from directly above, but if you sit and type like a normal person they will be invisible to you.<br /><br />Also, the keys are not backlit when your computer is booting up, so don’t use a complicated password on your PC or you’ll need a flashlight to enter it.<br /><br />They were kind enough to throw in a USB port and some mic/headphone hookups, but there are no dedicated media buttons.  I really miss having those buttons on my keyboard.  It was nice to just be able to hit 'mute' and take a phone call without making the recipient listen to the Clash at full volume.<br /><br />So I give it one star for being a functioning keyboarddddddddd (sorry) and one more star for all the pretty colors.  But Razer, next time you make a gaming keyboard I would really appreciate one that doesn't have sticky keys, and it wouldn't kill you to make the # 's light up like all the other characters."
2.0,"There is no support for windows 10. Which means that although the keyboard and media keys will work, you cannot program any of the G keys. Corsair told me themselves, they will not upgrade the software for this."
2.0,"There are a lot of people complaining here that they received wrong battery and it doesn't fit.  I was one of them.  I have a Dell Inspiron 15R SE (7520),  a notorious power hog.  The seller on my original order was Easy Fine and I ordered from them because it was Prime and fulfilled by Amazon and in view of the problems of others, I figured it would be easiest to return.  (It was).  I decided to take another shot and ordered from the EPS Battery Store (actually lower price.)  I figured since they were fairly local, I could show up on their doorstep personally if I had to.  Battery has arrived.  Fits as specified.  Has the bulge for the extra 3 cells on the bottom so the screen opens fully.  Battery life has jumped from maybe 2 hours to 4.5.  Now the only question is durability but I won't know that for a while.  Hopefully, this saves someone else from having to go through the hassle some of us have.  Ok, it's 6 months in and performance has dropped considerably.  Getting less than 2 hours of life out of a full charge now.  Guess that's how they keep the price down. Either the cells are scavenged or new but poor quality."
2.0,"Backblaze shows this as the drive with the highest cumulative failure rate in their regularly-published statistics, and I have to say that my experience bears this out.  I've bought a total of 3 of these on Amazon (one two years ago, the other two under a year ago).  The oldest failed after just over a year, and was replaced under warranty.  The replacement drive failed today, not even a year later (and no longer under warranty).  50% isn't a great average, especially considering that the other two are not yet a year old.<br /><br />I run them in a RAID so this is mainly an exercise in frustration.  However, just the effort required to RMA the things has to be factored in, as well as the return mailing expense.<br /><br />I would never run of these as a standard desktop drive outside of a RAID, even with daily backups.  The pain factor would be enormous.<br /><br />I still gave it 2 stars.  The fact is that there aren't a lot of 3TB 7200 RPM drives out there, and these are the cheapest of them by a significant margin.  If you don't mind playing musical drives, they may still be a good buy."
2.0,works only sometimes. super bright blue light that bugs me.
2.0,"I recommend only using these wipes when you have some real grease or grime to get off your screen/device. I bought these to clean the back of my Galaxy S6 Edge+ before applying a back protector. It does dry quickly, but both wipes I tried left little bits of lint-like material on the phone. I found that extremely annoying. So it is my opinion that these wipes are best used as a pre-treatment for removing nasty grime, followed by a good microfiber electronics cloth after the screen dries (to remove any lint that the wipe may have left behind). For 5 bucks, 70 wipes is a pretty good value and they are handy to have nearby for your laptop/tv. The dispenser is terribly designed and too large. You'll likely have to pull a bunch out at once, manually tear off a wipe, and shove the excess back down into the canister. Definitely don't purchase if you're looking for a one step cleaning method, as they require a microfiber follow-up to remove their stupid lint. I'd rather use just a microfiber smooth cloth for removing dust or fingerprints than these."
2.0,The fan is hitting a wire and makes noises.  Waiting for it to break.
2.0,Returned.  Did not fit.
2.0,"Not good for me. But still recommend for the users, who do light work."
2.0,"Too bad.  Great screen, keyboard and design.  But the touchpad has a terrible delay when you use two finger swipe to move down a page.  To make matters worse Dell's responses range from its Microsoft's Driver's, to the notion that this is normal operation for this model.  Emails to support promise a 24 hour response but in my case took 7 days.  Returned.  Again, a shame."
2.0,"The wrist rest was a great size and height, but this keyboard is massive. Why do so many keyboards have 2 keypads anyways? They would do way better to get rid of the one on the right which would allow your mouse to be there (more ergonomic!) instead. I ended up with a Kinesis Freestyle keyboard for this reason (no extra keypad!)"
2.0,I have nothing to use this device with. I ordered by mistake. I'm sure it's a great product but not for me.
2.0,Corners cracked within 3 months of light use.  It was been retired to the local recycling center...
2.0,"While the connection is working the unit produces a broad, strong signal which is a vast improvement over my previous router, the Apple Time Capsule.  However, a few fatal flaws.  The 5.0 ghz stops broadcasting randomly and often is not available.  Second, after the 30-day return window expired my unit continuously drops the internet connection, probably about 20-30 times per day.  It comes back, but after about 1 minute.  This is clearly not acceptable, especially since I rely on a consistent signal for my business as we use the internet for our phone line.  If the connection maintained this would be an excellent option.  I recently updated the firmware and the problem actually has become even worse.  I will be contacting the company to see if I can get it replaced or returned post 30-days."
2.0,This would not mount to my MacBook Pro 2015.
2.0,"Doesn't consistently stream a signal, cuts out and loses signal from wifi modem"
2.0,Great product
2.0,It broke after about three months of use.  Strange buzzing from the right ear.
2.0,"I find that is not as easy to use as my regular Kindle Fire.  When I am reading the kindle it freezes up (because you hold it on the side).  Also you have to get out of it to brighten or darken your text that you are reading.  Lastly, the advertisements that come up every time you turn the HD Kindle Fire on are annoying."
2.0,"works, but I have a fat head...feels like my head is in a vice after a few minutes...not comfy"
2.0,Was ok at first but within a year it broke.
2.0,"There's little reason to doubt why anyone wants to buy this low budget option of 2.1 speaker is because of subwoofer. For the price, this isn't the worst, but it doesn't suit the demand or expectation of buyers either, in that regard. Subwoofer itself is flawed in my opinion, because it's speaker is placed on the bottom of the box, instead of front or side. However, that is not the most disappointing feature of the product, or lack there of as a matter of speaking fact. The biggest flaw of this speaker is that it did not separate subwoofer volume to stereo speaker's control. As a result, you either have to crank the volume to max or give up satisfying thump of subwoofer, and even when volume is maxed out, the subwoofer is buried deep between to the sound produced by stereo. Overall sound quality is quite nice, but it just is not an option you should choose if you seek to find that low-cost variant of subwoofer system that can still be satisfactory."
2.0,Awkward to use in tablet mode a bit large for me.<br /><br />Retuned it.
2.0,"I do not recommend this headset (Microsoft LifeChat LX-6000). Here's why.. The audio controller on the cord causes the audio to crackle. The cord is a stiff plastic so it will crack in time. Also, the microphone level is weak with it cranked to 100%.<br /><br />I've used different headsets over time and these are not designed well at all."
2.0,The outside of this item felt cheap and flimsy. I removed the actual card and it works okay for what i need it for.
2.0,"I like the product, it is really nice and practical, but I am really disgusted with Amazon, as I ordered 2 of these organizers, and they where delivered in different dates but worst of all they were diferent sizes and brands. Actually one of them was much smaller and generic brand, but it was paid at full price. I can't return the product as I received it just a day before I was leaving.<br /><br />Talking about the product it is a good product, at least the original. It holds everything into place."
2.0,"Works good for sending audio to my stereo, but it will NOT allow you to hear phone calls through the connected speakers.  This might not be a big deal for most people, but I am on a lot of conference calls that I like to hear through a speaker system."
2.0,I brought this NAS drive with lot of excitement. I am disappointed with the performance and annoyed with the vibration it creates.<br />The transfer rate to the NAS drive is way too slow.
2.0,Very flimsy. Mic broke after a month. Not very well made
2.0,This boards outputs 3v and 3.8v not the 3.3v and 5.0v as advertised. I was pretty disappointed since I use a lot of 5v devices.
2.0,The rubber tip is too small and I have to tap things twice a lot of times.
2.0,Worked great at first.. Each last about a month or less. Definitely not a good long term investment.
2.0,Long and doesn't kink but the end is loose on everything we connect it to.
2.0,"lousy.  plastic so soft it wobbles constantly.  Mounting is easy enough, but what's the point if you can't comfortably watch things once it is in place"
2.0,hard to smooth out
2.0,"Not the original cover from Apple. The magnet is weak and the sides started fraying after a week.<br />[[ASIN:B00IZX2NRC Smart Magnetic Cover for Apple iPad 2 , iPad 3 and iPad 4 Auto sleep /Wake / Stand function (2 in1 SkyBlue, For iPad 2/3/4)]]"
2.0,Does not connect to the tablet
2.0,I don't believe this is any percentage of leather.  Much lighter and less substantial that I expected.  This is going to be a backup.
2.0,SanDisk told me I needed to send this to them to format it. It will not recognize in any of my items.
2.0,"The case is cute and sturdy, however the snap does not stay on the computer and falls off frequently. Maybe there is something Im doing wrong though."
2.0,"Stopped working with no water damage and has not been dropped, same thing happened to the other one I bought for my son. Didn't buy it for it to go out couple months later, hardly used."
2.0,Didn't allow me to do as I liked
2.0,"The sleep/wake feature does not work,  the top cover doesn't want to stay in the rolled up position."
2.0,"It will work fine for about 20 minutes (5GHz band) then drops connection.  After approximately 2 minutes, it reconnects.  The 2.4GHz band seems to have no problem.  Running Windows 7pro x64.<br /><br />What I have done so far<br /><br />Latest drivers from Netis website.<br />Tried different USB ports on my system<br />Fresh install of Windows 7pro sp1 x64 (all MS updates applied)<br /><br />Routers I am using<br />Asus RT-AC66U (2.4GHz & 5GHz)<br />AT&T Uverse Gateway (2.4GHz only)<br /><br />I had been using a TP-LINK Archer T4UH AC1200 that I moved to my wifes computer when I bought the Netis.  No problems with the TP-Link<br /><br />The problem ONLY happens when running on the 5GHz band.  I have no dropped connections while using 2.4GHz band.<br /><br />No response from Netis support."
2.0,I like ASUS products but this one has terrible 2.4 GHz connections that randomly drop to single digit Mbps for no reason while in the same room.  5 Ghz works much better but the connection to the internet still seems the &#34;shut off&#34; temporarily at times.  Going to replace it since many of my devices are still using 2.4 GHz.  Hopefully this was just a bad apple in an otherwise nice product line from ASUS.
2.0,"worked the 1st time, second time it wouldn't charge my tablet."
2.0,Being a women wasn't to thrilled with the look. It also had a magnetic closing and messed with the Asus.
2.0,One of the 3 port sets stopped working after several months.  I also have a problem with my usb keyboard rarely being recognized unless I unplug and plug it back in.  Look elsewhere.
2.0,"I felt a little disappointed with it when I first opened it. The color was a little off, which wasn't a huge deal, but it just had a weird feel to it and the zippers seemed to be low quality. But the straps seemed to be durable and it had a lot of pockets, so I felt like I could deal with it. I took it to work the first day; I didn't stuff it, but I did fill it up.Halfway through the day, I looked down and saw that the outside material had split along the height of one of the sides and the lining was exposed. Not only did it look horrible, but I decided to buy this one mostly because it was waterproof; It isn't waterproof anymore if the material is split. Luckily, Amazon has an amazing return process so I sent it back."
2.0,Pros: Applied easily to device.<br /><br />Cons: Not anti-finger print.<br /><br />Amazon shows this product when searching for tempered glass screen protectors.  This is NOT tempered glass
2.0,"I got this for my Raspberry PI<br />Berryboot did not work well with it, some times I would see the display most time not at all.<br />NOOBS worked great.<br />I have a Netgear Neo TV and the monitor gave me input out of range. change settings to 1600x900-60HZ<br />As I can't see anything I do not have a clue how to do that.<br />The 2 things I don't like is the audio jack cable is about 3/4 of an inch and is in the way for any thing next to that,<br />a 90 degree adapter will fix that but that adds more cost.<br />My VGA cable come unplugged now and then as there are not stand-offs to screw into.<br />All in all not great,  a button on it to change the output to a smaller resolution would be useful."
2.0,had get a IT person to reload the Microsoft.
2.0,I only had this unit less then a week and I am very disappointed with it. It constantly reboots during the day...........every day. I am a comcast xfinity customer..I am sending back as soon as I research a replacement model.
2.0,"Everytime I insert this into my laptop, it appears to disable my wifi somehow. I'm unable to connect to my internet while I'm using this battery. When I remove it, my wifi works again. It's very strange."
2.0,"I have one of these , for about a year now ,  why can't they make them so you can change the rechargeable Batteries on your own when they go dead and will not keep a charge anymore???"
2.0,"The device started out terrific!!!  Used it with 3 different laptops.  Then, all of a sudden it stopped working at month 9....  For $15 I guess I shouldn't expect more.  Now I have to purchase another device, I think I'll pay a bit more for a product that will last at least a year!!!!"
2.0,"I don't know why, but this shield seems to have a hazy vertical line down the center.  (Yes, I removed the protective film.)  I expected a glass product to be uniformly transparent with no &#34;haze&#34; to it, but am rather disappointed with this."
2.0,"Unfortunately this USB device doesn't fit in any of the USB ports on my Surface Pro 3 or its docking station. The width of the red border around the key is just a fraction too wide to fit in the ports. When it does fit in a USB port such as on my desktop, it works fine. The key loop seems a little thin and fragile, I would not feel comfortable trusting it to stay secure."
2.0,"Bought two of these mouses and had to return one because it would not track properly and the dpi switch buttons would not work. Thankfully, I was able to get a refund for the mouse, but since both mice were meant to be birthday presents it kind of stinks that one person will get their present on time and the other wont."
2.0,This cable is very cheap and the quality is not the greatest very difficult to make cables out of because the wire inside is so flimsy and the jacket is thinner than normal network cables so when you do get an ending it doesn't crimp tight on the jacket portion
2.0,First of all Amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card. It is different that what was listed on the page. There goes a star for incorrect shipping. And the item has stopped working after a week in my Surface tablet.
2.0,"This is an awesome tablet and I liked it, except mine never worked properly. It kept freezing and not starting and staying lit after I turned it off. As a college student I could not afford to keep an unreliable devise. So I returned it after two and a half weeks."
2.0,power button big problem
2.0,"This is NOT a UL certified cord as the listing claims. There is no UL designation anywhere on it and I looked it over with a magnifying glass including the packaging. I'm afraid to use non-UL electrical stuff in my house and around my family.<br />Underwriters Laboratory (UL) certifies products sold in the USA to be free of fire hazards. Products with UL promise they will not cause a fire under normal use. Of course, what most people don't know is most of the cheap stuff from Asia doesn't have UL but they put all kinds of other symbols and designations on it which are meaningless in the USA.<br />I never thought much about it until I had more than one power cord purchased online that actually did nearly cause a fire, two different laptop power packs. One overheated, but one actually melted and smoked to the point where it was strong smelling and the entire plastic casing melted as it burned up inside,  Fortunately I caught it before it got worse because I was in the room at the time but could have easily burned the carpet or worse. To be fair, this cord in the review is not a transformer type, so there is less risk, but its still unfair for it to be listed as UL certified when it is clearly not. And speaking of fair, Amazon is sending this FBA yet there is no where in the listing to contact them and let them know its not UL, customers have a right to know what they are bringing into their home.<br />I have decided to only use this cord as a backup and not leave it plugged in when I'm not around. 999/1000 people may not have a problem but I don't want to be the one that does, as I've had in the past with other non-UL stuff.<br /><br />If the seller adjusts the description I'll adjust my review.<br /><br />Also, be aware this is a very light duty cord. Its thinner and wimpier than the typical cord of this nature, and lighter weight than the Mac Mini cable for which I bought it. For normal use (since the Mac draws less than 100W) I'm not seeing this as an issue. But depending on the device you are powering its not a bad idea to check the power rating so you aren't in overload. Thanks for reading.ing its not a bad idea to check the power rating so you aren't in overload. Thanks for reading."
2.0,"The leather case was &#34;beautiful&#34;, but it really doesn't offer much protection for you Palm unit."
2.0,Case broke soon after buying. Not good quality at all.<br />Save your money and buy a case from Apple instead.
2.0,It is hard to read the display because of the light bleeding to other sections of the LCD. The codes don't display propeller and change hundreds of times per second.
2.0,Too Flimsy.
2.0,"This does NOT work with Kindle Fire!  So disgusted that I wasted my money.  Almost, I can use it on my Nexus.  Only reason it's getting two stars.  But I don't NEED it for that, that is not WHY I bought it."
2.0,The product didn't last very long.  I only used it for 2 months and not very often at that and it stopped working.
2.0,"The hard shell was great, but I did not receive the free keyboard cover. The free keyboard cover was the reason that I purchased the case. :-( Delivery time was fast."
2.0,"I'll lead with the pros: the machine would potentially be a beast, it has a good screen, lots of memory and the best mobile GPU out there.<br /><br />The reason nobody should buy this machine is, simply put, that it crashes. I'm talking about machine freezing blue screen of death crashes that happen while gaming (every 20 minutes or so of FPS gaming) and, especially painful for my use case, while using virtualization technology.<br />The whole systems freezes with a machine check exception any time you try to install Linux, both as a guest OS and as a secondary operating system.  (All this was tried with both the bios and drivers that the machines shipped with and with the latest bios and drivers. Tested with multiple bios options).<br /><br />MSI Support reproduced the issue so unfortunately it looks like a design flaw of the machine (my guess would be a bios/firmware issue).<br /><br />There are a few more issues with the machine (for example the fact that it requires a reboot to switch between the 2 available video cards and that it requires windows to do so, thus making it impossible to use exclusively an alternative operating system).<br /><br />Basically its instability while gaming (which it is designed for) and the impossibility of running Linux on it make this machine a huge missed opportunity."
2.0,The disc was not readable and the multiple drivers I tried only allowed only 800 x 600 even when plugged into a 3.0 port...  I will gladly give this product a better rating if I'm given a driver that makes the device function as advertised.
2.0,Not suitable for displays that require high bandwidth such as 4k@60 and 1440p@144hz. Causes flicker and won't properly drive freesync/adaptive-sync. Works great on my 1440p@60hz displays though.
2.0,"i just received it to day, i couldn't make it work in my window 7, it says drivers not found i even download online driver software still not working. help please"
2.0,Did not fit the DVD player sdvd1332 as advertised
2.0,I have had this mac book case for no more than three days and the bottom part has already broken.  It looks great but it's not durable at all.
2.0,This doesn't work with a touch screen laptop.  I'll be selling it cheap on EBay.
2.0,"Slow, small, and unresponsive. Compared to my 2013 Kindles (2), this was a let down."
2.0,"I loved my original fire, which I use to supplement the iPad if my husband is using it. With Amazon's July &#34;sale&#34;, I thought why not pick up another one as the original did start gradually getting laggy. I'm afraid it doesn't hold the same quality.  Poor battery life in comparison. Volume isn't as loud, and I don't care for the placement of the buttons. (Volume, on/off, etc) for the price, it's ok, but they've gone down in quality, and I don't expect it to last. Too bad my original requires frequent &#34;reboot&#34;. Doesn't compare to the iPad at all"
2.0,"Don't get me wrong it's a great bag, lots of space. But the material isn't very strong, or maybe my laptop is too heavy, but the bag was ripped on one side after a week of use."
2.0,This fits a 17 inch laptop. Not really what I was looking for.
2.0,"The tablet was good until I noticed it takes 7 hours to charge. I'm going to complain, maybe I received the wrong charger"
2.0,The D-Pads' right and down buttons were not functioning properly. There is also a very annoying squeaking noise coming from the right analog stick every time I rotate it. Can't say I would recommend this controller.
2.0,The base is flimsy and the magnetic buckle does not stay closed.  Plus the buckle will not stay to the back of the case when using the iPad; flips forward on the iPad surface.
2.0,"Be careful of the colors, they are nothing like they are online. They are washed out and faded and nowhere near as vibrant"
2.0,I bought these to replace my old Logitech headset that broke after years of use. This is a poorly designed product. Even with the volume up on my computer and on the headset I still could barely hear anything. Worthless!!
2.0,I have had this bag for nearly 1 year. Great bag for the price. I &#34;like&#34; it. It holds my laptop and book and looks good.<br />The reason I gave it 2  stars because for 3 reasons<br />1) There is no grip - i think this is a design flaw - i miss that - especially when i am rushing<br />2) the magnet clip to close the bag never holds properly - wrong design here again<br />3) the leather strap - really bad quality - it gives on falling apart. - that is the worse.<br /><br />Anyway I am on the lookout for a new leather bag.
2.0,"This bag is fantastic looking - gorgeous (I have it in light blue). It's very structured, smart-looking, and the leather is soft. The stitching is high quality. Then why the bad review? It lacks functionality! My bag cannot handle a 15.4&#34; laptop. The shoulder strap falls off continuously. The silver ring it straps on with is held up in a strange way. Basically, it's a clippy hook that falls apart because it's meant to stay together by inserting a circular post into an oval ring. Obviously, a circle slips out of an oval. If it'd been the opposite way around, there wouldn't be a problem. I'm really unhappy about the fact that this bag can't actually be used to tote a laptop, because it's quite lovely otherwise."
2.0,The actual case isn't as pictured. It's much more &#34;plastic&#34; in reality. Looks and feels cheap. Very disappointed for this price range.
2.0,"Started failing around 10 months, died at 12.  Was the OS disk for a NVR, so it didn't have a heavy load.  ADATA replaced it without any hassle (if you don't consider their RMA process a hassle).  May just be luck of the draw, but this is my first SSD and ADATA purchase.  For me, the problem didn't build any customer loyalty to ADATA (and I am typically loyal to brands whose products work well)."
2.0,Item doesnt show as many fingerprints but scratches easily and isnt consitently matte. It appears blochie.
2.0,I was very unsatisfied with this. It did not fit my tripod so the ipad wobbled.
2.0,Breaks easily... wife is not happy at all.
2.0,"They changed the size, doesn't fit as good as the last one I ordered.  You can hardly find the power button now and have to push very hard."
2.0,"I bought two as a back up for my Gopro Hero 3.One from Amazon the other was a gift from BB.Both did not work in my cameras, thinking it was Gopro's new update.Kept getting a SDERRI returned other and it worked with no problem.NOTE to all, there are boot-legged products out there It is hard todetect. But of all the Items I've received from Amazon/Prime and beyondHave been great. I just got stuck with a bad batch.GoPro recommends HX,HC,XC and extreme micro cards."
2.0,I do not like this product.  Very cheaply made.  It does seem to work good if you have very small fingers and patience.  Sometimes it does not type capital letters when you have the shift key pressed.  The worst part is the mouse pad.  Very small and very unresponsive.  A lot of work need to be done to improve the mouse pad.
2.0,"Well made and sturdy, but the wireless connection on it is garbage. There is a small delay that can sometimes get up to a one second delay."
2.0,"I've always liked gear head equipment but I think the shipping and handling of this was not good enough. almost all of them that I ordered (I ordered 10 of them) are cracked on the bottom and one of them, the screen on the top was bent up pretty bad."
2.0,I used it with my mac. The sound was OK but there is very huge lag if you are playing a video and displaying it in a tv.
2.0,"Purchased 3, 1 was bad"
2.0,"I just called Sandisk and they say they have a new card version that corrects the problem. 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)Sandisk Tech says that the new package will show that the card is made after March, 2013 (don't know if that includes March, but probably does), and it should be corrected. Some older than late 2012 reportedly are ok.  Who knows.They even say that they will provide a free UPS return label.Of course, you are taking a risk as to whether the problem is really fixed, so keep backups.  I don't know what I would do."
2.0,"Setup required a wireless computer that I did not have.  I can't say if it worked or not, since I returned it."
2.0,"Not all 3.0 USB are created equal. Yeah, this one is slow but cheap.  If you're gonna label it USB 3.0, should back it up with comparable performance.  It's no better than 2.0.  If they labeled it 2.0, I would have given it 4 stars.  Docked 3 stars for deception.  Cheap price, decent build quality, crap performance.<br /><br />Kingston, you whiffed on this one."
2.0,"The top, bottom and sides fit perfectly. the keyboard bezel is not sized correctly. The width is too wide so it either has to hang off to left or to the right. I found you can restick it several times..."
2.0,"Likes: WISP function, battery-powered, when it worked.<br /><br />Dislikes: It didn't work most of the time."
2.0,"It says that it is MiFi certified, and yet 7/10 times that I plug it in to my iphone 5- I get the &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; message. Very disappointing. Luckily it was inexpensive"
2.0,Directions are very confusing which made me end up with a bunch of bubbles..
2.0,Some of the stitching is coming undone but it's cheap so that's to be expected. I don't care for the &#34;Amazon basics&#34; logo on the bag as it screams &#34;this is cheap&#34;. The small series of pockets don't fit the length of an average pen... Which is weird.Oh well. I needed a bag for my laptop.
2.0,maybe full HD... but looks like crap
2.0,"While this cover is nicely priced, you get what you pay for. Within two weeks the case began cracking where you open the computer. Now, 3 months later several pieces have broken off. Great color, but it's got to go."
2.0,One of the punchdown teeth was defective and i had to use pliers to ensure the green cable would be tight enough for a good contact.  It was not worth my time returning it and so I made it work.  Other than that it was the solution i was looking for.
2.0,"REQUIRES 32 bit windows xp or 7 to set up. vonets support isnt the best either, if i could, id remote into it over ip and be done, but it doesnt like that either...."
2.0,Do not get me wrong this is a beautiful bag.. I do not recommend if you are thinking of purchasing for college; There is absolutely no room in this bag.
2.0,"Looked like a good quality cable, but gave out within a month.  Don't think the connectors are touching properly to charge the phone.  Ordered 2 and both are having the same problem on 2 different phones.  Other cables around the house are charging both phones fine.<br /><br />Just my experience, maybe I happen to receive 2 defective units."
2.0,"I've had the tablet since the 15th of August and it has malfunctioned (not even 15 days have passed). On the highest level you can barely hear it. The surround sound was working fine at first. Little by little the sound kept going up and down in volume without me adjusting it. I will be returning this item. I'm disappointed, it started off as great and now it's useless without proper sound."
2.0,"Was not impressed at all with this keyboard. Yes it is cheap and you get what you pay for, but for $5 more you can get this! (Which I did shortly after recieving the blue finger) The bluefinger is thin and flimsy plastic, would not recommend it.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNQG0N4/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_qbY3vbHJ8YP9F"
2.0,"THIS BOARD CAN NOT OPERATE MOST OF IT'S COMPONANTS AT THE SAME TIME!  BUYER BE WARE.  I've had slow, sometimes rude, tech support.  Almost always get generic level 1 support on strange off-hours and no call back.  Thunderbolt is not working.  Had to RMA first board, but turns out problems might be overall design flaws.  RAM identification off all DIMMS needs to be reset EVERYTIME you make a change to the board.  This is the 18th workstation I've built for film editing, and this kind of product is what drives people to apple.  I'm weeks behind because of this board, uninstalling and reinstalling software....  AVOID for professional work."
2.0,"The zipper is super faulty. The bag is very cute & the perfect size, but my zipper broke after 7 uses."
2.0,"If you think this listing seems too good to be true, you are correct. Samsung does not make this drive. They do not even make this style. What you have here is a generic USB flash drive stamped with the Samsung name and packaged up in an equally counterfeit package.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives are invariably fake-capacity drives - low capacity drives hacked to make them appear to have a much higher capacity.<br /><br />FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br/>Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information."
2.0,"I just got this. I think it would have been great if not for the dust that was attached to it before I even got it on. I cleaned my screen VERY well before attempting to put this on but the sticky side had particulates on it straight out of the box that are impossible to get off and make my screen look messy, bubbled, and just plain awful. The protector will not lay flat. It was just the right size for my screen, but ultimately, a disappointing waste of money. If you live in a place that is vaccum sealed and has absolutely no dust in the air, this might work for you. Good luck with that."
2.0,"While it is a beautiful piece of hardware, the cursor wobbles and jitters horribly when drawing anything that's not a horizontal or vertical line. This makes this tablet monitor unsuited for precision work, such as inking."
2.0,"I already order  four but just only 3 are working, I was expect all the four card working, I feel you want this item , request only one , try if is work , if not you can return the item...,"
2.0,"Its not 100% improvement.  Anytime a product has instructions which says search youtube for install method that is a problem.<br />Could not get 100% of bubbles out.  While using credit card to get more force to remove bubbles, the actual screen is scratched.  It was my mistake to buy a laptop with a mirror like screen and my mistake buying this to try to remedy it."
2.0,"I made this purchase because I thought this would process by pictures quickly.  This card is the slowest card I have, and I have some cheap cards."
2.0,Not readily compatible with Mac Computers(despite the advertisement).  Had to use my Windows system.
2.0,"When I ordered this I had high hopes but was very disappointed. When I opened my package it claimed it had a USB to USB cable in the box which was not to be found, the instructions weren't helpful, and  I don't understand why an advertised HD monitor does not come with an HDMI cable in the box.<br />I would recommend buying another monitor."
2.0,"it is not easy to find 24 inch monitor with the rear feature to hang, becareful look for the monitor first, now I am screw up"
2.0,It works when it wants.
2.0,Recorded a couple of times and then stopped working.  The USB drive remained functional.
2.0,"This broke after minimal use, after 6 months."
2.0,"Purchased this tablet primarily for Pandora use for my 1 year old; it was Lollipop 5.0, a decent processor and the price was absolutely right.  The speaker level at maximum couldn't be heard over a Vornado fan at medium power, the resolution of the screen was bad enough that I thought there was a piece of plastic covering the screen, and the camera resolution is pathetic (1.6megapixel on the rear and .9 megapixel on the front).  As mentioned by some others, it's a pretty SLOW device and the internal 4GB available memory isn't that much.  Save your money and go with something better."
2.0,Awful sound at medium & high frequency. Bass is good though. Do not recommend.
2.0,"cheaply made and came apart before i even opened it.<br />save your money and buy a nicer, branded mouse bungee."
2.0,"It's a case that any 17&#34; or 17.3&#34; (e.g., Dell 177000 series) laptop computer will fit. But, the paddding on the bottom & corners is marginal and unsatisfactory to protect the computer inside from anything but extraordinarily cautious handling. Likewise, the bag is flimsy in construction and the strap is easily unhooked from its plastic rings. I'd recommend spending more money and buying a heavy duty Swiss brand which would offer some robust protection."
2.0,"Great capaciry card of 128GB, I would NOT recommend this to anyone who think is fast write, it is not fast write. It took a few hours to copy 2 or 3 movies to it. It is great and reasonable fast to READ but not to write.<br />2) If you copy more than 1 file at the time, it didn’t copy the full data’s and you notced that the data is not in some of the files.<br />If you notice, they have not saying about write time at all!"
2.0,Didn't last but a few months. Severely disappointed.
2.0,Screen keep freezing only had it for a week and half .
2.0,"Didn't work, but I was using old cables and they might have been the problem. I bought a new much longer cable and resolved my issue."
2.0,The size of the cover is too large. I makes it hard to use the touch screen in the corner (where the alerts are located). The overall thickness of the is about twice the thickness of my previous cover for my older tablet. I like to put it in my pocket and this thickness precludes that.
2.0,The battery is horrible. I can only use it for twenty minutes before it needs to be charged.
2.0,"My Fire always said, &#34; Low power charger.&#34; After about a month and a half, I had to put it in a certain position to make the connection. Nope."
3.0,"They work as they are supposed to. The ear area is a little smaller around than I would prefer. I like the Turtle Beach X12 better but I guess you get what you pay for. The mic is normal quality for a headset like this, I wouldn't say it is worse than the X12s. There should be a way to clip the wire to your shirt as the volume control block is really thick and big and gets in the way."
3.0,The Cruzer has very large secured capacity.  The negative is the speed - takes hours to securely delete trash ... way too long for an SSD.
3.0,"These speakers sound OK,  They are definitely lacking a mid range on sound.  The LED's look cool, but don't really pulse unless you turn the volume really high.  Also, both speakers are on one wire so you can't put the wires through grommets on your desk without minor modification.  The overall feel is a little cheap as well."
3.0,"Not what i wanted or expected from RAZER, felt like cheap plastic....price tooo high!!"
3.0,"It works ok, but for a cost to performance ratio I don't know if it was worth it. They increase on our back deck is negligible. I added this antenna as well as the version without the base so I was hoping for a bit more from the two of them."
3.0,"I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It's not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card."
3.0,Cord is shorter than original one. The adapter also gets extremely hot.
3.0,This product is ok I have problems with keeping charging my computor like if I move it to a certain spot it will charger but if I move it even a little it will stop charging. But it's OK it does its job sometimes there better ones out there probably
3.0,To heavy and not enough time to figure it out yet..will follow up
3.0,good
3.0,works well; but keeps dropping out of computer
3.0,none
3.0,The good news is that one of the tablets don't work & I got a full refund. Thanks to Paypal great customer service skills!!!!
3.0,"I've had this cable for about five months now, and every month I had it, it got slower and the connection got weaker. Just last night it failed and delivered a ping of 240ms and a download speed of 1.2 mbps. I thought my ISP was screwing me over but it was this cable the whole time. The months that it was functioning it out-performed my other Cat6 cables. It has CAT7 specs but poor quality control. I would steer clear and find a certified CAT7 on NewEgg or another website that doesn't just allow any brand to sell their products."
3.0,"This is a really nice, professional looking portfolio cover with a notepad at a great price.  BUT--there is NO protection or padding on the corners for your iPad.  I found this out the hard way.  Did not even drop it, just had it in my bag on a cold morning, put the bag down (gently--not dropped) while waiting, and the iPad was damaged on one of the outside corners--the corner of the iPad rests right on the zipper, so it's not only not padded, but on something rather hard.  So if you're putting it in a padded slot in a briefcase--GREAT, but don't expect this to really *protect* the iPad."
3.0,transaction was goo . But a friend had bought one and she told me she thought it very complicated to use. She is a computer teacher.  So I knew it wasn't for me and so I srnt it back.
3.0,"It fits, but there was a little damage on the edge and fingerprints leave smudges to look dirty. It looks nothing like the picture."
3.0,It stores data and does a good job at it. What else can you say about something that has become so common place in today's world?
3.0,"Best quality for the cost. Hands-down the most comfortable long-use headset I've had for gaming.<br />I use a 7.1 surround sound system for music with all the VoIP chatting on the headset.<br />This works fantastically!!!<br /><br />Edit after this 2nd pair decided to take a dump on me again. (5/26/16)<br />This is the 2nd pair that has not only shorted itself, but also shorted the USB in my 2nd unrelated motherboard that required me to reseat cables and power cycle the board praying that it didn't burn out the USB connector like my first mobo. I really really love the comfortable headphones, but it's severely disappointing to me that this is doing more damage than good at this point.<br /><br />Leaving this as 3-star since I may be an anomaly, but infuriating that I've gone through 2 now with the same issue on 2 different mobos."
3.0,Not gigabit
3.0,Not resistant to permormanse live or workof field
3.0,"After a great length of time using the Ceton card, it has been more of a miss than a hit. When it works, it's awesome. The quality of the video is better than that of the cable box recording for HD content as wel as standard definition. Also, being able to record 4 HD shows at the same time was a great feature. However, the card would tend to lose connection often. Despite all the support that Ceton provided and driver updates, it never really solved the drop in connections. Only by rebooting the computer does it seems to reestablish a connection."
3.0,"Tried to return to amazon, and I received a &#34;health and safety&#34; risk, no longer returnable.  That sounds kind of scary. The speakers seem ok, but they buzz out of the right channel sometimes."
3.0,made headphones sound tinny and seemed to have some potential shorts. Ya get what ya pay for! It was very cheap. I would advise paying a few bucks more to get a better quality product.
3.0,The tab on the front leaves a sticky residue. Why not have only the tab on the pull-off sheet.
3.0,"This keyboard is not a bad.  It does have a couple things wrong with it.  The letters on the keys are fading now after about 1 year of use.  Also, I didn't think the location of the question mark key would bother me that much, but I was wrong."
3.0,"The link to activate the router didn't even work anymore! I had to call their call center overseas in order to manually install the router. It works great now that it's set up, but what a pain!"
3.0,"However, SanDisk replaced it and didn't charge for shipping.  So I guess I'll wait and see how long this one lasts."
3.0,"I have been using these cables for 2 years now. At first, I would only need to buy a new replacement cable every 10-12 months. Just recently in June 2015 I purchased a replacement, but by August 2015, a mere two months, it was malfunctioning. My issue with the cables is the very common need to keep the cable at certain angle to get it to work, but it had never happened in just two months before. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me a free replacement, which I appreciated, but the problem was that the replacement was worse than the one I had complained about, needing an even more extreme angle of the cable to work. At this point I have just decided to switch to a different brand of charging cable.<br /><br />So overall:<br />~Points for being a usually very durable cable with good teeth on the micro usb that usually lasted me 10-12 months<br />~Points for the prompt customer service in getting me a replacement<br />~Reduction for the cable that was malfunctioning within 2 months and the replacement working even less"
3.0,"We've had it for a few weeks. It works. It has a background &#34;hum&#34; when there isn't anything being delivered. I'm not sure if it is the headphones or the computer I use them on, but I didn't have the hum with the other headphones I was using. Otherwise it sounds okay. We want some durability, and we won't know the answer to that issue for a while."
3.0,It does what it's supposed to. The base is heavy enough for normal wires. The unit I received looks a bit different from the picture so it is not quite as attractive as the display model. The only other issue was that it smelled terrible (like a strong industrial plasticy smell) for about a month after I opened it. The smell was strong enough that it filled whatever room the product was in and I had to leave it outside until the smell went away. Washing did not help at all.
3.0,"product arrived in good condition and appeared to be correct.  however, my wife found that this will not fit the Acer CB3-111 c670 that it is automatically suggested as an extra purchase with.<br /><br />returning... and have a disappointed wife."
3.0,too low of a profile for my taste..lower than it looks..and the pads on bottom are not the greatest..tracks roughly...otherwise it's good.
3.0,"DEFINITELY NOT WATERPROOF!  The off gassing is significant.  If I had known it was coming from so far away and take so long, I would not have ordered it."
3.0,Super cute!!!!! But only lasted 4 months before the sides starting tearing. Good for light users:) Fast shipping and delivery time:)
3.0,it makes a buzzing sound. it works though. i would recommend getting an original
3.0,"it needs more storage, kids like lots of games."
3.0,sometimes does not work
3.0,"The product protects the ipad nicely.  I hadn't considered its propping angle but having just one angle now instead of the 3 I had before I miss that option.  Although this one angle is more secure than the three I had before, so its a tradeoff you have to consider."
3.0,Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating.
3.0,wasnt able to use as its possible having issue with the hard disk supply unit
3.0,"Average product. Works as intended. The cover hides half the volume adjusting buttons on the ipad air, so that is a little bit of a pain."
3.0,not what i expected in sound quality
3.0,Been using for nearly a year and the smell is still overbearing.
3.0,"I purchased two of these tablets for my daughter. The first one functioned well but slow. The second one required you to hold the power button for ~12seconds to start and it frequently locked up. It worked well when it worked but I had to reinstall apps regularly. I also own two fire kindles, a Samsung Galaxy and an iPad so it was easy to see the difference in video quality.  It is a good starter tablet for a child."
3.0,Its o.k.
3.0,Good for the price. Loud at load.
3.0,The cord on it is too short and I am going to get another one with a longer cord
3.0,"Way too noisy, cooling is very good. If you are a heavy gamer with gaming headphone set, you can simply ignore the noise."
3.0,Upon hooking up the cable from my TV's USB port and my Firestick. I started up the unit while it did power up I kept getting a warning message of low. I then swapped the cable out with a longer micro USB cable and used the same USB port on my TV. Result is no warnings. Swapping back again I received the warnings again. I do not know why I am getting the warning but the Fire Stick appears to work just fine. It does(the cable) help on clearing up the clutter so that is why I marked it with three stars.
3.0,"The cover was not all red. The corners were black. I didn't like the way it looked.  I returned this item, but kept the black version. It does allow it to stand on the landscape side, but not the portrait side. I've had for about one month. It feels a little flimsy now. Still works."
3.0,Cheap but looks nice. One of the ears stopped working after a few weeks from the day I purchased it. Most likely loose contacts.
3.0,Nice bag. Good layout and and lots of internal and external compartment areas. Two complaints.  One is the out side zipper sticks in one area but has not jammed. Two the strap is fixed and you must untwist it before throwing it over your shoulder.
3.0,Works properly but has been harder to get used it.
3.0,"The only thing that I don't like about this case is, I don't think it's for an iPad Air 2. In order for me to get my volume to work I had break off a part of the case ."
3.0,Doesn't last as long as original battery
3.0,"The board is a cute idea. However the magnet is totally useless.<br />At first I thought the whole board itself is a magnet on the back so it could stick on the fridge. But it actually is for little magnet stick on the four corners of the board and after only one day, the board came off on the floor. They are not sticky enough to hold the weight of the board."
3.0,Received a defective one that did not want to format.  Returned it.  Bought a different brand instead although from past experience Sandisk has been fine.
3.0,"Does the job.<br />Pretty loud fan though, you can get better for the same price elsewhere."
3.0,"It worked well for only 3 months, and stopped charging.<br />Update: the seller replaced this item. I am now on my second charger. It is working fine. Will update in a few months if this one doesn't last."
3.0,After a few months of use the plastic broke. A little super glue fixed it but how long will it last.
3.0,Split screened as said for xp. Lags a lot.
3.0,interfers with wifi signal
3.0,"Bought to play Game of War on it, which of course would not run on it.  Otherwise might have been great, just not what I wanted it for."
3.0,While the drive is great the CyberLink that comes with it will not load onto my Windows 10 computer!
3.0,1 Faulty controller but they replaced quick. However batteries die very quickly. Analogs don't respond right away. And triggers already started going bad. Not bad for a cheap back-up. But would recommend buying an official ps3 controller for quality. This just enough to get by.
3.0,"For casual users, I think they will be ok with this modem. That said, I personally had an issue with this one. If you are a gamer, toss it to the curb. Every 5-15 minutes, my ping to, say Google, would go from 35 to 560 for about 3 seconds. ISP confirmed there were no issues with my connection. Crippling for any online gaming. Range isn't great either.<br /><br />I just replaced it with a Motorola modem. No more issues."
3.0,I'm having concerns about  the volumn  It goes all the down to a faint whisper after a short time in use. I'm going to use it to watch something at length and see if this continues.  If so I will return it for a new one. If this is necessary I will need a return label sent to me as I don't have a printer. Will be in touch.
3.0,"First the good:<br />The board was shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. It functioned exactly as described.<br />Now, the not so good:<br />As noted by others, there is absolutely no documentation included. Not even a marking on the board to tell you how to attach wiring to the relays. You have to completely rely on the Internet to get any info at all. Even direct inquiries to the Sainsmart website are met with days of silence followed by cryptic requests for more information. Useless.<br />I'm sure it's a great board for light duty in robotics projects, as long as the relays are activated slowly.<br />I intended to use it in a virtual pinball project to control feedback devices. (Mostly solenoids). This board is not up to the task for this application. Rapid input such as fast activation of flippers or jet buttons cause the board to freak out and stop reacting to incoming signals. I stops activating the relays and the only way out is to exit and restart Visual Pinball. There are better solutions that are made specifically for Visual Pinball DOF."
3.0,It's ok
3.0,Good. Life is shorter than 3 hours
3.0,Only lasted two years (less than the original) and now I have to buy another one. Maybe I will buy an original because the generics are not making the cut.
3.0,REALLY GOOD DID EVERYTHING I NEEDED IT TO
3.0,"Even though I generally use android tablets, I wound up returning this and bought an Ipad Air 2. At the end of the day, I was pretty displeased with the premium price tag, but poor build quality. I actually went through multiple exchanges and found all sorts of issues. One unit had the loose rubber backing. Another one had huge amounts of screen bleed. Another one came damaged on arrival. All in all, I was very disappointed. Lollipop did seem promising however."
3.0,Great display.
3.0,"Well, it does work and glad that it is not fake as you would get if you bought from other online stores at $50 a piece. But their max transfer speed is only at 18mb/s not 30 as advertised and I have a very decent desktop with usb3 connector."
3.0,"Why is it Logitech makes awesome keyboards and mice, but their headsets are just okay? Logitech, if you're reading this, you guys can do better. I always buy Logitech brand gaming peripherals, and while these are decent, I've already run into my fair share of issues with them, specifically the sound cutting out, and coming back on randomly. If you want a quality gaming headset, look elsewhere, if you want a budget gaming headset, these aren't too bad, but don't expect the best."
3.0,"HDMI came broken, but it worked fine otherwise.  I would suggest checking all the video input types when you get it.  I returned this unit."
3.0,Did not last long. Got 1 year out of it before it was at 25% life at full charge
3.0,STOPPED WORKING 1ST WEEK... WOULDN'T CHARGE- FROZE... SAD PURCHASE
3.0,Shipped quickly and is a nice fit. The only problem I have is that the magnetic keyboard doesn't hold in place well at all.
3.0,Seems to have some problems.  Freezes u.p Deletes messages at random..  Just downloaded latest version of operating system.  If this does not solve the problem will try Apple store.
3.0,was nice the 2 weeks it worked turned it one one day to use it and the screen came up with only lines. Working on a return with amazon. I do not like that you have to plug in and un plug the key board if the tablet has blue tooth capabilities I would think the key board would as well. I am having them replace it but would not recommend it as it lasted only 2 weeks. When it worked it was nice and worked well.
3.0,"Nice design but the interior stiching is not done well, so be carful when taking out the &#34;removable&#34; padding. The Velcro will pull out the stitching immediately. Mine ripped out the first time. The zippers could be higher quality. Wish I could give a better review, I like the look and design."
3.0,It does not hold the charge as much as I expected. if it goes on like this I have to return it
3.0,"This thing is mostly plastic with a few wires inside; at 33% of the cost of a new Nexus 7 2013 tablet, it is outlandishly overpriced."
3.0,"Hi dear, it was a great experience and a lot more than a dream come true. I appreciate the offer."
3.0,"Purchased to replace wrist strap on cane. From Amazon product pictures appeared that clasp holding strap to elastic piece was similar to key ring similar to the previous wrist strap. However, clasp is a ring with abutted ends. Installation was a bit difficult as I had to pry open the ends, slip through the cane post, then crimp ends closed. The strap works (and perhaps elastic allows for easier installation) however if you are purchasing to easily loop ring through cane post this strap is a bit more labor intensive than the photos suggest."
3.0,300 screws and not a single one I need.  They are screws and they are tiny.  I have a Sony Vaio notebook and needed to replace a few screws that have fallen out over the last year.  The description says Sony so I ordered it.  Well none of the screws are long enough for the one I needed to hold the DVD drive in place.  I got screwed.  But there are a lot of them .
3.0,As described.. love the feel and color
3.0,"I like it comes in handy fits good with my Galaxy S5 smartphone, no problem with filing data on a computer."
3.0,"This kindle has a lot of nice features like dual cameras, but I am not at all impressed with the speakers. I hooked up the kindle to an auxiliary speaker to listen in the car and could barely hear the audio book. Couldn't turn up the volume any higher. I also had a terrible experience with support and was told there was NOTHING they could do for me and that I would have to purchase a new kindle (this one) and did not have any discounts.Left a bad taste, especially since I have purchased 4 previous kindles for family members."
3.0,Very nice i i wll buy it again.
3.0,There are no screws or tape as described. Also does not stay together well. The top falls off easy.
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,I'ts ok for the money.
3.0,stopped working after 5 months. asus rma process is hit and miss. if you get someone who speaks english it goes ok. if not then not so much. when it was working it worked very well.
3.0,"Ok it is USB 3.0 on the outside, data transfer and recognition of USB 3.0 devices .... i better don´t start to curse here .... kept it because cheap and the buttons are great to switch on/off attached equipment like headset/camera etc. when needed. DON´T by tu use it for your USB 3.0 HDD or USB drives LOL!!!"
3.0,"It was great having a long cable and worked great for 2 months. I bought this June 17 and now on August 29 i am getting an error reading &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34; on my iPhone 6, and it stops charging.  I had the same problem with non-apple charge cords in the past so I was careful to check that this was 'Apple Certified' but now it stopped working again."
3.0,ok
3.0,I gave it 3 stars since it is a nice cable but it does have flaws. The actual connection is to long so it fits awkwardly into the micro usb port. Also it DOES NOT SUPPORT QUICK CHARGE. If your phone features the qualcomm quick charge 2.0 don't get this cable since it will only do a standard charge. Spend a little extra and get one from a brand called anker.
3.0,In my opinion it's difficult to use.
3.0,Chemical smell is too dense.
3.0,"I was excited by the prospect. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The instructions were less than clear, so I could not tell if the device was actually recording. I did get one recording from it, but since it is limited to 2 GB of output, about thirty minutes, it proved to be too difficult to be of real use.<br />The support staff was attentive, and really tried to help overcome the deficiencies, but, for me, it just didn't deliver as advertised.<br />Perhaps the use of their software would have mitigated the deficiencies, but it is only for PC, and not compatible with my Mac."
3.0,Not the best quality but the price isn't bad either
3.0,"It isn't as fast as the class10 I used before, and the file structure only allows 29.7G free to put data on.  I can see SOME loss, but I'm very displeased with losing over 2G of space!  That's a big waste percentage."
3.0,good price bad qaulity image.
3.0,NO COMMRNT
3.0,Works well enough so far but the slide just runs loose unless you snap it in place which is not as easy as it looks.  Could be a lot better designed
3.0,"As other people on here have mention, the separators in between some of the pockets started shredding a few months after I got this thing. It's great how much space and compartments it has for the price, but it doesn't hold up for very long. Also the little side mesh pockets are too small to fit water bottles into"
3.0,I just got it Let u all know if it works ...in 6 hrs to full charge
3.0,"The mouse is alright; clearly a cheap Logitech clone; vastly inferior build quality - which is fitting for the price point to a certain extent.<br /><br />Mine works alright for now, but shipped with a broken internal part - an internal clip of some kind that snapped off (Image: http://bit.ly/1LFh0mu), that I had to shake down to the butt of the mouse and out through the open battery cover.<br /><br />So, I'm giving it 3 stars because it's \\""okay\\"" - it seems to work well enough; but the build quality is immediately disappointing. The broken clip I had to shake out of the mouse's innards put me over the edge here. That's immediately shoddy."
3.0,"windows10 is annoying, HUGE CALCULATOR to take up an entire screen...like who needs that? what happened to the simple straight to point calculator? why the flamboyance? yuck!!"
3.0,"I ordered this a while back for my husband. He's a die-hard Fate Zero fan. He absolutely loved it. It's the perfect size for phones, which is where he put his. My only complaint about it is the adhesive wore off after a bit, and he kept slicing his fingers on the decal as it was peeling from his phone. Other than that, it was totally rad."
3.0,Works good
3.0,"Original battery holds up to 7 hours, but this only holds up to 3 hours..."
3.0,U can hear but can't see anything
3.0,Destroyed to easily
3.0,"The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn't, and it's forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple."
3.0,Fits the computer. Would not keep it safe if the computer were to fall on concrete but protects against scratches.
3.0,It good but it falls out unfortunately.
3.0,"It was OK, but it didn't suit my needs."
3.0,"Material feels durable, but not confident that the screen will stay protected since my child can touch the bare screen through the case, instead of the case having plastic to avoid fingerprints and having something drop on the screen. May be returning this item."
3.0,"Well even though it is exactly the same part number as the old dvd it doesn't fit, physically different.  I wonder if the old one was modified and this is entirely the wrong part. Eventually the old DVD failed entirely. I tool this to the basement and modified the sheet metal to match the other also modified DVD and installed it. It is not a perfect match still but it plugs in and works. Up to 3 stars from 2 since I shouldn't have to modify a part that was supposedly made for the computer."
3.0,I love this mouse but the usb adapter is bigger than it should be and got bent in my backpack (i connect it to my work laptop). Now my keyboard and mouse don't work!
3.0,"Surely it generally does what it claims to do.  Although, beware: if you have intentions of plugging your keyboard into it, the USB ports on your keyboard basically become useless.  All-in-all, it's a nice, handy product but it definitely doesn't fit in seamlessly with the iMac and/or its accessories such as the optical super-drive.  Apple products are indeed metallic but they are matte-finished with a higher-end look while this product is glossy with a plastic look.  Oh and it won't lay flat on your desk if you have a 27&#34; iMac like me -- you'll have to put something like the optical super-drive under it."
3.0,"I don't get too worked up about memory cards, usually try to buy at least class 10. I am sure this is a fine card, just the one I purchased was defective.  Replaced it with another brand, not wanting to try twice."
3.0,"It's a good product, and inexpensive enough to buy more than one. The plastic screen cover is too rigid and makes it difficult to use portions of the screen. The stand never wanted to stay on, and after putting it back on ten times, it just gave up altogether.<br /><br />Otherwise, my kids have dropped the iPad and it has survived those spills. It does what it's supposed to do."
3.0,"If you're never going to be more than about 10 feet from the receiver, then you may never have a problem with this little unit. It should work exactly as advertised. However, once you get about twelve feet away, or worse, about 15, then you're looking at annoyingly intermittent reception of telemetry. I have this plugged into my HTPC, and if I need to click on something that doesn't take up 10% of the screen, I have to use my Logitech wireless mouse, because the &#34;airmouse&#34; is so ridiculously buggy at the distance my couch is from my computer. The rest of the features on this thing work well enough, especially at close range, but the airmouse feels like something better suited to a knock-off of a Nintendo Wii. Additionally, the hotkeys for the controlling media functions, like pause/play, fast forward, reverse, require pressing 2 keys, which are on opposite sides of the keyboard. If you have 2 free hands, that's not a problem, but if you're trying to be slick, and use it like a fancy, new-aged, next-gen, intuitive remote control, then you're out of luck. Maybe the next iteration of this decent device will see an additional Fn key situated on the side, where you could press it with a finger, while you hit the media function keys with your thumb."
3.0,its not working as well as i hoped
3.0,This didn't provide me with the distance I needed. My neighbor and I share our internet (there is a bout a 15 ft distance between our houses) and the router was positioned next to the window. I can pick up the internet just fine with my laptop and download 1-2mb's easy. My PS4 would keep disconnecting and it would go in and out even when hardwired in the Nighthawk. Just can't justify spending this about of money in when it's not giving the boost it describes.
3.0,"Softwear freezes repeatedly.  It doesn't interact with other apps. Otherwise, great size."
3.0,"When I first inserted the card in my computer it wouldn't recognize it.  Had to &#34;jiggle&#34; it around in the card reader, and then it took a long time for my computer to finally recognize something was there.  When I tried to read and/or format the card it kept telling me &#34;There is no disc installed in removable drive E&#34;.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cause/fix before I tried a different SD adapter.  As soon as I changed adapters the card worked perfectly."
3.0,Great at first but didn't last long. The teeth that connects to your phone wouldn't stay in the phone after a couple of months.
3.0,Met expectations but quite noisy.
3.0,"I really love the color and it fit really well on my MacBook Pro,  and the price was really great it just didn't last very long before it broke"
3.0,So far it's works good
3.0,No comments
3.0,Does' it's job but chord is too short
3.0,A lot bulkier than I expected.
3.0,"when it did work it worked well, one day it just died 3 months after I bought it. I know these thinks happen with any memory card, it happened to me on another card I had, but that is another story. luckily sandisk has decent customer service, and will send me a new card, they were actually easy to work with, I contacted them through email, hopefully all goes well that ends well"
3.0,I bought a white one and a black one. The white one works perfectly but I'm having problems out of the black one.
3.0,Awesome lights and I love the color.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the switch placement is terrible for use with most motherboards.
3.0,Fyi my pc has bsod alot since i got these a few months back. I dint think of returning them becouse i dint think it happened enough but oh boy was I wrong. I shoulda stuck with my old RAM and not look for bargain stuff. I cant say 100 percent but ive reasearched the Bsod NS Hd mem dumps and 80 % have been RAM issues. Only thing that changed was the RAM.Been using my old ram for close to two maybe three months not a single BSOD. done goofed up
3.0,It's ok. It's a lil slower than I expected.
3.0,good
3.0,It's a nice tablet. I got it for school and it works OK so far. The only thing is that it glitches sometimes and will randomly bring you to s voice which is annoying. Also the on and off button works only when it wants to making it difficult when you want to turn it off. Lastly it takes crappy pictures by that's not super important.  All in all its ok especially for the price.
3.0,"I just received this product and I was delighted. Although my Kindle Fire HD 7 fits in this case it doesn't seem as if this keyboard is compatible. But I do still think that this case is of good quality. I will try to get a refund and by looking at the other reviews, It seems as if the customer service of this product is reliable."
3.0,I must say I was shocked at how fast I was able to unlock a lock easy to use and cheap it's a very simple tool
3.0,delivery time is perfect.quality is good eventhough not perfect.
3.0,"Comfortable, stylish, but it's a little over priced. It's not as big as I expected it to be. My backpack from Wal-Mart can fit more stuff in it. But overall it's decent."
3.0,"the only thing I dislike about this cable is the lightning end is larger than the oem one from apple, so its not compatible with my lifeproof case.  other than that, this cable does everything it is supposed to do"
3.0,Like this though it is not very sturdy
3.0,Its cute like the color and pattern. Fits the tablet fine but there is no hole for the charging plug without flipping the tablet upsidedown. Not a fan
3.0,Fan works great cooling laptop. Stand has many variations but is a little flimsy.
3.0,"Does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it blocks the SATA port of the Banana Pi M1+ board, and I wasn't able to modify this adapter to remedy the problem, so I was forced to buy a different style dongle."
3.0,"Pros<br />works<br />has decent microphone<br />great audio<br /><br />Cons<br />constant feedback when talking to others (even when the mic is turned off with the turn off switch, and when that happens all in-game or any audio is transmitted to the people I am talking to, making it difficult to gave background noises)<br />mic is SUPER sensitive (and yes I have played with the settings and know what I am doing)<br />not as comfy as I hoped, I have a big head and ears and always makes them sore"
3.0,it is to touchy.
3.0,"good overall - fits my hand better than smaller mice<br />nice fabric covered cord, variable DPI<br />bad: buttons start going flaky in less than a year - would probably only last a few months if I was a gamer"
3.0,"I bought this device to have more memory ( 4gb vs 2 gb) and a brighter display when reading at night, I have an original Kindle with push buttons instead of touch screen. When setting up the Paperwhite the screen froze up and I could not get it to respond, even after cutting it off and back on. So, because of ths negative experience, I returned it because I lost confidence in it and, frankly, for some reason, my original Kindle just felt better."
3.0,"I have both an iPad Air and an iPad Air 2.  Product works great for iPad Air and uploads hundreds of pictures from my Nikon SIM card in under a minute.  But unfortunately my iPad Air 2 does not recognize the device.  Five stars if not for that.  Since my first review, the product has stopped working for all my iPads (all on IOS 9).  It appears there is an issue in IOS  9 that affects devices like this.  From blogs and forums elsewhere, even the Apple SD Card reader does not work on IOS 9.  If anyone is aware of a work around please advise."
3.0,"The middle button is extremely sensitive. I have mine set to bring up the Start Menu on a double tap, and every bump with my middle finger seems to activate it. It also took me more than twenty minutes to get it to go into pairing mode. The bottom button is extremely difficult to work with, and the &#34;light&#34; that shows it's in pairing mode actually comes on AFTER pairing mode is activated, not AS pairing mode is activated. (In other words, by waiting for the light, I was holding the button on too long, and the mouse was power cycling off.)<br /><br />Kind of annoying that a mouse manufactured by Microsoft IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MICROSOFT MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CENTER! Seriously, you can't make your own products work together? In order to customize it, you have to download an APP from the Microsoft store. So far, the app ONLY allows you to customize the middle button and scrolling rates/feedback volume. I expected, for a mouse that retails for $64, to be able to set a two or three button click as well.<br /><br />I like that it seems to have less lag than the cheaper Optimal Shop one on my Win10 tablet. It also loses connection less frequently. I like that it flattens out, but the sensitivity of the middle button remains a concern. Hopefully I'll get used to it, or Microsoft will recognize that maybe their products should work together and allow the Keyboard and Mouse center to work with it."
3.0,"It's ok, range is pretty short, keys are super small, unit is hard to hold and using the edge keys makes it flip up when on a hard surface.  Good for quick use if needed.  Better to get a larger wireless keyboard."
3.0,"Would not buy again.....times out and is a pain to get started again.  Is ergonomically uncomfortable to use, and a waste of money for the wireless.  Buy a plug in!"
3.0,"The case does not wrap around even with the screen so there's a small amount of the edge of the screen unprotected. When folding the case into an upright stand, it's rather unstable and falls if the table is bumped. Overall I like the color but I will probably order a new different case soon."
3.0,I received the battery quickly enough but it keeps falling out of the laptop. No more mobile computer.
3.0,"Works well enough. It does have some quirks. When I leave my system on and let it sleep it does have issues. The monitor blinks on and off, and you hear some kind of system notification sound as well. I am not sure what the problem is. It does switch the screens and USB keyboard/mouse as expected though."
3.0,The microphone piece fell apart after three days of having it.
3.0,I am not very techy so this was difficult for me to figure out and consequently use.  I'm sure it was no fault of the product more likely &#34;User error&#34;.
3.0,"a Little small,  I'd preferred it had a 7&#34; screen.  text looks great,  fonts are much easier to read on this than my tablet.  plus the battery lasts much longer. the big plus for this is the battery time.  I charge it once and can read forever it seems.  so that is a big plus.  works great in full sun shine too just like it says  that is a big plus I can use it with out the glare I get on my tablet.  over all nice reader."
3.0,"It does the job. I have the new mac book air and its fits, but it doesn't fit great. One of the rubber pads on the bottom is misaligned. For the price it works but it definitely isn't the best."
3.0,Doesn't fit my lifeproof case.
3.0,"It does work tho sometimes pulling or pluging something in will cause other things (flash drives,etc) too be not readable unless you fiddle with them. Kinda wish they made frame a little more stronger and not wobbly."
3.0,"The mouse itself is really cool looking, and the buttons are great. My main complaint is that after a month of use now whenever I scroll it shoots in the opposite direction. It's getting worse and more annoying. Unfortunately I now have to get another mouse."
3.0,"This Item does not have a very good average quality, I ordered two for my dual monitor, one of them becomes defected after 5 hour's using."
3.0,"I got this to play Majora's Mask and it works really well, but it is definetly generic. It doesn't quite fit nicely in your hands, and there is a small area in each joystick that doesn't do anything, but it prevents drift.<br />Overall, totally worth $9, considering it does what is intended, and the real version is around $40."
3.0,this pad is great for everything besides gaming unless you enjoy hardpads there is no texture difference and  it glides too quickly for precise games like CS:GO but maybe for rpg's but it is very comfortable and has a nice aesthetic appeaal
3.0,Be careful. The keyboard is no longer available.
3.0,This item is made of nice quality. My iPad mini fits perfectly and snug. It is quite difficult to use the handle because the holder does not stay folded open. I still need to grip the other end of the ipad with my fingers when trying to read in bed which gets tiring. The handheld feature would have been great if there was a way to keep the case open.
3.0,"I've owned 3 different NOOK models and currently own a Samsung Tab 4 NOOK.  While none were perfect, I have been happy with them.  Having read all of the Kindle hype and finding an excellent offer, I purchased this model.  I'm not impressed.  I like that it came registered and partially set up, but the owners guide is very lame.  I am extremely frustrated with the lack of a HOME button.  Having to swipe up or down is easily transmitted as a screen scroll instead.  And I find that many of my favorite apps just aren't available for the kindle.  Ex.  I love the weather on my local ABC station, but kindle seems to only offer NBC.  So tired of being limited because companies are afraid of a little competition.  And the Silk browser, no wonder I never heard of it before; there is nothing good to say about it.  I will not purchase another kindle."
3.0,I've had this card for about a year and I've been very careful with it and it just broke when I popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasn't broken
3.0,"Pluses:<br />Extremely slim and lightweight, so it doesn't take up a lot of space.<br />Stand attaches quickly with no need for tools.<br />Plug-and-play: just plug it in and go. Didn't require any special drivers or cumbersome setup.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Poor speakers. Really bad sound quality. Don't rely on the built in speakers for your primary sound needs. Sound was so bad I don't even know why they bothered.<br />Takes a lot of adjustments to get image picture quality right: Had to keep fiddling with the settings to get the correct brightness and color output. Once it was set, the image is acceptable but nothing great.<br /><br />Overall, this would be a good choice for a secondary monitor, but as a primary monitor it is a bit lacking. If you are a casual computer user, the monitor is perfectly functional. But if you watch movies or play games from your computer, you will want a higher end monitor."
3.0,"It was a really easy setup, but here in DC my xbox is about 10 feet from the window and I get 0 signals. So I am marking it down two starts because it is not very strong."
3.0,Doesn't have as much space as I thought it has.
3.0,"It is too heavy for me, and I found I didn't use the keyboard much at all."
3.0,"Bought this one because another one by another manufacture made too much noise with the tablet was secured in it.  This one is much quieter, no noise with it in or out; however, the build is not that high of quality.  The padding on the bracket to protect your tablet is already falling off.  In addition, the way the tablet mounts is top heavy causing it to swing down (not fall off, the bracket just swings down) unless you consistently re-tighten the bracket before every use."
3.0,I wanted the Kindle with Wifi and 3G but this one only has wifi. When I realized this I tried to exchange it and was even willing to pay the upcharge but Amazon did not allow me to do so without paying for a whole new one. This was very disappointing to me as I have normally received good customer service from them but not this time around.
3.0,It handles nice and the battery seems to last a long time but it is not a full size mouse like I expected. The description should be more obvious. It is about 3/4 the size of a normal mouse and my palm almost completely covers it.
3.0,To short of wifi range
3.0,I have 4 of these running in a Synology NAS since 2012.  I have had 2 replace 2 of them so the active life isn't the greatest but then again they are meant for desktop use.
3.0,"Installation is a bit lengthy for a wifi adapter, signal strength is good but not great."
3.0,"I bought two pieces and they were working well, but after filling one of them with videos, the entire card just failed. I was unable to reformat it, even by using Partition Magic. Otherwise the other one is working just fine."
3.0,Wish it was smear proof.
3.0,"As soon as I got these I was pretty disappointed, the build quality seems pretty poor, they are very flimsy and seem like they would break after a decent amount of force had Bebe applied to them. When I got them the mute button for the mic was missing but I couldn't be bothered posting them back to America just to get a mic mute button. The sponge on the actual ear pieces is very tough and uncomfortable at first but after a few days or a week of use they will soon soften up and become pretty comfortable. Overall these headphones are top tier but if you're looking for a temporary pair of headphones whilst you save up for a top tier pair then these will do fine as they are easy to set up and use."
3.0,"I join the long list of customers who have had their SanDisk die on them.  Customer service from SanDisk has been helpful.  They pay for UPS shipping for the return and promise a 7-10 day turn around once the defective disk has been returned.  Still it's a pain to deal with and I lost some photographs.UPDATE: SanDisk sent me a replacement and it seems to be working.  If the replacement goes bad, I'll be back to complain:)SECOND UPDATE: All is well with the replacement so I'm giving it three stars."
3.0,"I suddenly needed to replace my 10 year old Airport Extreme Base Station, and this one looked like it might work (I also tried the Belkin AC1200 (Gigabit) and TRENDnet TEW-812DRU...I eventually decided on the TRENDnet).<br /><br />I was primarily looking for router function, and wireless was just icing. I believe I would have been fine with an 802.11n device, but opted for the AC for some future purpose.  that being said, the wireless worked decent enough: both in range and quality.  Also, the configuration UI was pleasant enough.<br /><br />The reason I retuned it was because the router dropped my 50Mb connection from Suddenlink down to about 20 (tested using a single hardwired PC into the switch), in spite of the gigabit WAN port. There might be some configuration reason as to why it dropped, but I wasn't able to locate it with a quick Google search, and didn't want to take the time figure at a reason when I was able to replace the router and instantly get the speeds I was paying for."
3.0,Good thank
3.0,"If your computer is 13.3 inch, don't buy it. I recommend you to take the 14 inch one.<br />It's true that it is 13.3 inch, but this is the exterior size of the product. The inside size is 13 inch, so a 13.3 inch laptop won't fit in it. Be aware of this.<br />So, My advice is if your laptop is exactly the size of the sleeve, you should go for a bigger one."
3.0,"I got these headphones because I was sick of blowing through other pairs thanks to cable crimping and losing sound in one or both ears.  Having Bluetooth headphones is definitely a luxury worth every cent.  This set is surprisingly nice for the price and seeing how it's a rather off-brand company.  Pros - Controls were simple enough to set up to my android phone without a hitch. - The ear pads are very soft and comfortable.  They might make your ears a bit sore if you don't have them adjusted just right.  I prefer to have them set right around the bottom of my ears instead of completely overlapping them in middle. - Battery life is pretty good.  I can go several work days listening to music the whole time without worrying about the battery dying on me - The rubber/plastic headband is also very comfortable  Cons - Sound is decent, but not that great either, but that's typical for this price - The materials aren't that durable - No push-to-talk feature for the mic in case you were planning to use for gaming  Even though I tried my best to take care of them, I too am suffering the problem where the plastic in the headband around the fold joints is starting to break away which will ruin the whole thing.  I've barely had the set for a little more than a month, so this is quite a bummer seeing how much I initially liked them.  Best thing you can really do if you have a big head is to reinforce the plastic at the joint just a little using whatever you got.  Hopefully you can catch it early like I did so you can fix it.  If you can do that then you'll more than likely be satisfied with them for quite some time.  EDIT:: Removing another star.  After having them for about 6 months the band on the head split in half due to how it was stretching over my head to cover my ears.  I had to wrap it up with duct tape and now it doesn't look as nice.  Thankfully none of the wiring got damaged so it still plays audio just fine, but the band is a bit uncomfortable now.  If I had noticedsooner I probably could have reinforced it before it cracked, but if I'm gonna have to be taping up the entire headset just so it doesn't break, I should just get a different headset."
3.0,The case fits the 2nd Gen Nexus 7 perfectly.  I have own a Aegis Kraken Case for my Samsung case as well so I am comparing the two.  The Trident is an okay case and will protect the device but not as well as it's cousin the Kraken.  This has a soft cover with a somewhat hard plastic case for enclosure ... The Kraken on the other hand has a better plastic case and also comes with a very strudy and responsive BUILT-IN screen protector.  Honest opinion ... buy the Kraken and spend the extra bucks for it ... it is a much better case than the Trident.
3.0,"I ordered this piece to retrieve data from two hard drives from a failed desktop computer and transfer to a laptop. Getting it set up was easy, the problem lies with it showing as an available drive. The drives did not showed on neither of my laptops.  Apparently, this docking station is not being recognized by Windows 10, which both of my laptops have. I had to call up my USB stick with load Linux on the laptop for it to see the drives and being able to retrieve the data.<br /><br />In summary, I made it work, but for a person with little experience this would have being hard and may had returned it. If the manufacturer can update it to be seen in Windows 10 that would make it more functional."
3.0,"I got this to work with an Android player called Cubox. I have complaints about it. If you about to right click, it is cumbersome. If you want to scroll up and down, it is not so good. The keypad is a nice idea, but when you hit the keys, some of them double-type, so you always have to backspace over what you just typed. If you want to use the keyboard, you naturally want to hold it with both hands and that covers up the IR. Basically, it doesn't work that well. It is a nice small remote that works for everything else. It is very small. Some people may think that is a good thing, but I personally think it is a little too small. It does feel like a quality remote."
3.0,"The first one stopped working so had to be replaced.  The replaced one has childrens pictures as background  artwork.  I thought it was suppose to work with the keyboard i bought through bluetooth, but it doesn't.  I do like the camera.  It didn't come with the dictionaries or any of my books.  The books were not in the second kindle, i had to spend well over an hour having someone download them into it, and still i have to go back and get my dictionaries."
3.0,"I don't like having to touch the screen so many times just to turn the page in the Home Device or Cloud settings.  If I could touch the screen just like I do when I'm reading a book would be wonderful.  Other than that I really like my new Kindle.  It has a lot of options that are going to take me a while to learn, but I'm looking forward to it."
3.0,"So far battery sucks, doesn't last long, doesn't hold charge,"
3.0,It is too small and does not response well to the swipe..
3.0,The literature is not clear for average user
3.0,works fine but there is no UL sticker so I hope there is no fire here.
3.0,What you expect for the price.
3.0,"only two out of the three worked, but hey I had two spear. My family always is in need of one."
3.0,It was not the quality of leather I expected but the product is well designed and functional ....  I would consider that leather moderate quality ...  If you're looking for I am high-quality this is not that ...  go buy Bosca.
3.0,Recommended Installation-Tool price unbelievable
3.0,The touchscreen works well and the image it came with booted with no issues but this is NOT a capacitive touchscreen as stated in the description. It is resistive. Had i known it was resistive i would have purchased another product that was capacitive.
3.0,Case looks really nice and fits well but the magnet fell out after a month of use.
3.0,"Card is reasonably fast... when it works.  On my HP Pavilion + Win10 x64, the card produces BSOD (video_scheduler_internal_error) resulting in a needed restart pretty regularly when trying to use OBS to record video while playing video games, and during other video games as well (with or without OBS).  Latest drivers are in place, latest Win10 updates, and all the latest BIOS and drivers are in place on the PC so I think it's a driver issue.  I've also confirmed that no old drivers are lingering.  The error has been traced to a fault with the card accessing DirectX and then producing an invalid fence ID.  Various settings have been tried such as switching on multithreading in the 3D section of Nvidia Control Panel, etc. to no avail.  I would rate this card lower due to this problem because it makes playing video games unreliable and results in us getting banned for &#34;quitting&#34; mid game which is a major hassle, but I can't be 100% sure that the video card itself is at fault even though the prior card (9800 GT) works fine... but too slow to play many games."
3.0,It felt like pretty good quality but a seam came apart after a few weeks at the bottom of the front pocket. It doesn't affect the use at all but it is a blemish.
3.0,"Nice keyboard for typing, but not for coding.  The arrow keys as well as the  insert, delete home, end, page-up, page-down keys are half sized and not in the 'standard' location.  I knew this going in, but didn't think it would be as distracting as it is.  I've had the keyboard for over a month and I just can't get used to it.  It really needs to be about three inches wider to accommodate full sized keys.  Other than that, this is a good keyboard.  The keys have just the right amount of resistance and the travel is satisfactory.    I haven't tried it with gaming, but I'd suspect that it would not compare favorably with a real gaming keyboard."
3.0,Came charged to ~70%. Did not take very long to fully charge to 100%
3.0,"Looks fancy, so-so fit (definitively NOT snug, as it's gaping on the bottom backside), doesn't appear to provide much protection beyond preventing scratches to the outside of the Chromebook. Very un-impressed."
3.0,The paperwhite is a nice devise and is fairly easy to use once you get used to it.  I like the built in light. However having been a devout DX user it is not a DX. I miss my DX and wish the company had continued the product. The paperwhite is not as versatile as the DX and needs wireless conection.  It is not as easy to use as my DX was. Still it is a nice product and hopefully i will get over the loss of my old faithful DX.
3.0,It was good but failed after 18 month.<br /><br />I expected at least 3 years from such a trusted brand.
3.0,"Seems to give my celeron CPU a bit too much voltage. I'm not sure if it's an inaccurate reading on the motherboard's part, if the CPU is bad, or what the issue is, but either way it makes me a little nervous to see it getting 1.53 volts when it really should only get like 1.2-1.1."
3.0,"It does what it says it will do - unlike most people I know.It also handles very cold temperatures well, too."
3.0,Does just exactly what it was intended to do.  No lag. No service interrupted. Had Suddenlink but got tired of paying $15 a month for their router so I got my own router/modem combo.<br /><br />4 Feb 2016 - UPDATE - I recently downloaded the most current iOS 9 for my iPhone 6.  Now I can barely keep a connection to my wifi.  I'm going to do more research to see if it's the phone or the router/modem combo.  Maybe end up buying a separate model and router instead of having the combo.  More to come.<br /><br />7 Feb 2016 - Yep. I'm still struggling with WiFi issues on my phone. I cannot keep a connection to this WiFi combo. I'm constantly changing WiFi channels and resetting the system. My phone works on other networks...but for some reason this router/modem combo is going in and out.  Maybe it's a flaw in the system.  Hopefully Netgear can help me out.
3.0,ok

3.0,"Not being able to scroll with the trackball is very disappointing. OK for other mouse functions, but I scroll a lot, and not being able to do that is a huge drawback. I have Windows Vista operating system."
3.0,good product fair price
3.0,It serves it's purpose but it turns the kindle on if you accidentally open it even the tiniest bit. I wish it had an outter pockecy since I use my kindle case to store things
3.0,It does what it says but the price needs to come down. Alot. 3 stars bcuz it costs too much for what it is.
3.0,"When you first look at this Dell keyboard and mouse set, it appears to be nothing special, and you wonder why the combo is currently selling for $50.  Like so many other sets, both the keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, and the batteries for both are included.  (The batteries in this set, though, are suppose to last for 12 months. They are standard Duracell.)  The keyboard weighs 15.8 ounces and is 17 inches long.  The mouse weighs 3.1 ounces and is four inches long.  Both seem to be made of very thin plastic. The keyboard is comfortable enough to type on, but I don't think it's elevated enough in the back for comfortable extended use on a flat surface.  The mouse wheel is loose and smooth.  The combo uses a Logitech USB plug, and the drivers quickly installed on my laptop, after putting the plug in a USB port on my Toshiba.<br /><br />That USB plug can also be used in other devices, such as a TV, and that is why this keyboard and mouse set is different from many others.  As the description states, it is a multimedia set; which means it has dedicated media keys other keyboards do not; such as play, pause, fast forward and reverse, as well as three volume ones.  It's like the [[ASIN:B005DKZTMG Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad, Black]] or the [[ASIN:B00IICMUWS Microsoft Wireless All-In-One Media Keyboard (N9Z-00001)]], only this Dell has a mouse and not a touchpad.  Also, the Logitech 400, which I own, does not have as many dedicated media keys as this Dell, but the Microsoft one does. (Another keyboard you may want to look at that does have all the media  keys is the [[ASIN:B003VAGXZC Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 Combo]]).<br /><br />I tried the Dell plug in my LG Google TV,  which turned out to be the same exact plug as my Logitech keyboard plug, and the up and down keys, volume keys, play and pause keys all worked.  But the fast forward/reverse ones did not work on a show in my Amazon library.  The media keys also worked with  my Toshiba DVD Player, although I did not try the fast forward and reverse ones. When it comes right down to it, though, I prefer not to use media keys on a keyboard, but my TV remote control, or the media controls on a laptop or screen.  Also, when using a keyboard with my Google TV, I want a touchpad, not a mouse, which is why I got the Logitech 400. Thus, I'm presently not that impressed with this Dell keyboard and mouse combo.  But, one day in the future, I may get a device that will be perfect for this set.  (And Dell desktops and laptops are still my very favorite computers!)a DVD Player, although I did not try the fast forward and reverse ones.

3.0,"I have had my Kindle Fire for a while and I do enjoy reading on it and watching Amazon programs, it has been a real disappointment in terms of the service I have received for and ongoing problem. I downloaded the Tumblr app from the app store on the Kindle, but I have been unable to login. Each time I try to log in it says that it &#34;can not connect to Tumblr. Check connection and try again&#34;  I checked my connection. I am able to use the internet on all of my other kindle apps except that one.  When I called &#34;tech&#34; support, first I kept getting disconnected, then I received a call back from what looked like a local number and started talking to someone called &#34;Harry&#34;.  He asked if he could dial into my computer. He did a check and did a netstat test and said that we had &#34;strangers&#34; on our home network and they could clean up out home network for $149.  He claimed that that was why my Tumblr app wasn't working!

3.0,doesn't seem to pick up sound all that great
3.0,"Cool backpack, but it started ripping wide open at the seams at the top less than two months in.<br /><br />Great concept and look, poor execution it appears. Hope the next version will be better!"
3.0,"The card seemed to work well in most devices that I tried it in, but in a Samsung Galaxy S4 it would continue to unmount and mount over & over on the phone - a known issue on the Galaxy S4 forums due to a possibly bad batch of them.  I tried to reformat the card in the phone and from a PC computer, but that didn't help.  Finally I just called SanDisk and they had to RMA the card, which took about 2 weeks from start to finish when I had the new card in my hand.  The new 64 GB card from SanDisk looks slightly different, but still has gray & red on it.  However, it now works great in the Galaxy S4 and hasn't had any unmounting issues now for the past 3 weeks.Good card for pretty much everything else, except in the new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones."
3.0,It would work most of the time but found myself un-plugging and plugging back in at least once a week. May have been the electrical outlets in my home but did not work well for me.<br />Returned it and purchased a TP-Link router that I was able to bridge and works great.<br />TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N300 Home Router. you can replace the stock firmware with dd-wrt and get so many more features.
3.0,"This is an attractive cover, but my ipad falls out of it once in a while. I have to be careful."
3.0,"Gave it 4 stars because I don't know if the problem is the card or the phone.  I have an intermittant problem where the phone stops recognizing it.  But it's fast, and holds a lot.  I would recommend it.Update:  Had intermittant issues with my phone (galaxy s3).  Finally gave up the ghost completely, computer won't recognize it at all.  I don't think I had any important data on it.  I would take it up with SanDisk, as another reviewer indicated that they replaced his over issues in his phone, but my computer can't even recognize it to wipe it so I'm not sending it anywhere."
3.0,Very hard to get off computer once it is on.
3.0,"UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often). I can't wait to get the new 128GB model!"
3.0,"I ordered this case and when I received it, it didn't fit because it was for the iPad Air. I returned it and ordered another one. The same thing happened. So, I'm thinking that this description is wrong and it's only for the iPad Air."
3.0,"The 32gb holds alot and when they say that this memory card is fast, they mean it. Holds everything I need on my android phone and works well with it. Had a few issues with the phone primarily but it was resolved when I reset the phone (note: The phone is an old Sony Xperia Ion Lt28a and has had issues from overuse so I needed to reset it regardless of the memory card). Once I finished setting up the phone and memory card from factory specs the devices worked like a charm. Still would not overrate it though so 3 like most of my other reviews."
3.0,"I was hoping it would reach into two other builtings that are within 100 feet from where the router is at, and it does not  reach that far.<br />  Other then that it works okay."
3.0,"Really, like it as a tablet. As a telephone it is hard to hear. ADVICE: Use bluetooth, apply some type of screen protection, and get a case."
3.0,The color started wearing off after one month of use.
3.0,only complaint is the USB wont charge my phone or  books
3.0,i returned item
3.0,"For some reason, it made my system slower... However, they gave me a refund and it was easy to return."
3.0,"It's okay. I don't think i would buy it again though. It's a good buy if your looking for a case, but nothing fancy. Just mediocre."
3.0,It has a nice feel when typing but it is too thick to allow the MacBook Pro to close completely.
3.0,Adequate case. Nothing special.
3.0,"Quite easy to install. Driver for windos 10 easily available. Sound is nediocre and controls to better &#34;mix or eq&#34; the sound are almost non existent. Maybe the digital out put will do netter, but I highly doubt it.  Would buy something better, maybe more money but better results.<br />BOTTOM LINE; I would not buy it again and probably would recomend looking at other sound cards."
3.0,"My only issue  resolution not what is said, and camera but its for my daughter so ...lets see how it goes"
3.0,I love taking pictures on my Canon EOS M and posting pictures on social media such as Instagram and Facebook.  This SD card makes taking photos and uploading directly to my phone a much easier process than having to upload to my computer first.  The only down side is that the wifi connection can be a bit spotty and there have been quite a few times where my phone would reject the wifi from the card and would not connect. I typically have to go through a cycle of turning off my wifi on my phone and restarting my camera and eventually it works.  Still I like the card and its still more convenient than having to go through my computer first.
3.0,"Fairly good quality product, but very difficult to apply with no fault, ...the smallest piece of dust will create air bubbles that will be there to stay. At least glad there are 3 screens in the pack, I managed to get the third one about right.<br />The sheet is not immune to finger printed either, which is a bit disappointing."
3.0,Slow response sometimes
3.0,Gift to granddaughter for college and it is too bulky and combursion for easy mobility
3.0,Slower than expected transfer rates when used with phones and tablets...I had expected higher transfer rates given the data class
3.0,"I have tried every calibration scenario you can imagine and cannot get the gamma to appear as I would like.  The monitor is 3.5 feet away from me with the center at eye level.  It is at the lowest height adjustment the stand will allow.<br /><br />Trees in the background of any game are black blobs.  Movies are worse.<br /><br />I've adjusted settings on the monitor and through nVIDIA's control panel.  I've calibrated monitors for years and have never had this particular issue.<br /><br />When I stand up and look down at the monitor the image is perfect.  Sitting in front of it, terrible.<br /><br />I've contacted Samsung through their site, through the vendor I purchased it with and through social media.  No responses and I'm certain they would just walk me through settings which I've already tried.<br /><br />I can eliminate the &#34;black blob&#34; issue by adjusting the gamma, brightness, contrast and saturation through nVIDIA's control panel only.  No combination of settings (yes, tried Game Mode in those combinations, as well as dynamic contrast) makes a difference.  The problem is getting the nVIDIA settings to a point where I can see details in the trees washes everything else out and makes me feel like I am staring at the sun.<br /><br />This is not me not knowing the details of the various options.  This is just the only way I can get the details to pop out.  Youtube videos filmed in bright sunlit locations look like a candle lit speakeasy.<br /><br />Everything else about the monitor is great.  Sexy design, the jog button makes adjusting settings a snap.  The curve adds just enough immersion to make the difference between curved and flat screens worth the price of admission and though I don't use them, the speakers would do just fine in a pinch.<br /><br />Honestly though, I've never had so many issues trying to calibrate a monitor.  I would call it a gamma curve issue but I'm not sure why that would manifest itself in this way.  It is as if the viewing angle was designed to have me sitting 8 or 9 feet off the floor looking down at an average height office desk...lol.ngle was designed to have me sitting 8 or 9 feet off the floor looking down at an average height office desk...lol."
3.0,"access panel would not seat evenly, really gaudy in person, not good build quality, I disliked it at first sight<br /><br />has a power supply and lots of space, real upside there, just not the case for me"
3.0,"Although the interface is relatively simple to use and the book is very helpful, i can't seem to get a good resolution on the mac, so the faces are blurry, therefore making different facial expressions pointless. The annoying part is that the resolution only has a setting for windows as dictated in the instructions."
3.0,It was okay
3.0,only lasted for two months
3.0,I like the computer. Purchased it a few months ago.  Now there is a charge on my credit card from Cybernet  for $29.95? I never signed up for any online gaming when I purchased this computer!
3.0,"Damn, I've debated on this bag for awhile. One of the pictures showed the ability to use this briefcase as a backpack. Unfortunately, you cannot without lots of effort, time and annoyance. The strap is long enough to suffice the backpack configuration, but it does not set when placing it on. For example, when placing one arm through the opening to place on your shoulder, the other side of the strap pulls which does not allow you to place your other arm. I used my kitchen counter for help and it did not go well. LOL.<br /><br />Definitely condition the leather for a soft, conformed feel and to break it in. I placed many books inside and conditioned it, because the bag is stiff. [Duh, it's leather.] Be sure to loosen the two overlap straps which secure the bag closed, because the bottom is dependent on them-you'll lose adequate space when they are tight. The overlap straps are looped through rings at the bottom. I configured the overlap straps as shown in the main picture, because it is work unbuckling all three. The middle strap does just fine, but use caution if you carry the bag by its handle.<br /><br />Spending $199 for this bag was not worth the one use I reasoned to buy. I know it is a briefcase. Situations have occurred many times where I wish I could use it like a backpack for ease of traveling through the airport. There are no instructions on the many configurations this bag is capable of doing. I'm smart enough to figure it out on my own, but if there is a way to set the strap steady when using as a backpack . . . please send me it."
3.0,"Pretty flimsy, but not bad for the price."
3.0,"Uh, well for the price it's decent. Don't bother making calls with it because the mic isn't good enough for the other person to hear you. Volume on your end is fine, but if they can't hear you - kind of useless. As for the speaker, it's decent enough quality to have around for the occasional use, but it's not super crisp and clear. It's average, so three stars is all it's getting. For the $7 I paid, it's worth it."
3.0,"The mouse arrived on time and worked wonderfully after downloading the software from the Korean website listed on the boxed packaging. I play RTS games such as League of Legends and Star Craft so it was perfect for my needs in allowing multiple profiles to configure my buttons for each game. I loved that this mouse was a little heavier than a usual mouse and after 13 hours of play a day, was fairly comfortable to use. However, the mouse has recently died on me and no matter how much I eject the mouse and then reinsert it into the usb port, it remains to be nonresponsive. I've only had the mouse since May, 2015 and am disappointed that it died."
3.0,i have installations problems
3.0,I would have given the case a 4 if it allowed access to the SD card.
3.0,Didn't know that there was not a camera in this Ipad.
3.0,"One of the &#34;rubber&#34; feet fell off, they are just stickers. Also, when I open the laptop the case sometimes &#34;clicks&#34; off a bit. Otherwise, it serves its purpose."
3.0,You will have to do your research on how to use this device.  If you do not it will not work.
3.0,"For some reason this card HATES my Galaxy S4. I was running around in circles for a week trying to figure out why my phone would get stuck at the Samsung screen on reboots. Finally I decided to pull the card out, and voila, phone boots up fine again. It's now sitting in the ashtray in my car."
3.0,This does not work with Google. So beware. Better to get the Edge-n or the NEO that supports U2F which is more prevalent with Cloud based services. I'm having to return mine.
3.0,"Working as expected, no issues so far.."
3.0,Good but locks up too often.
3.0,Good!
3.0,"Being an old Kindle Fire owner, I am a bit disappointed with the battery life.  I often left my old (larger 7-8&#34; Kindle) on standby without powering off for days.  I was buying this one to replace my old one which has become somewhat unreliable in the battery charging area.  With a full charge and no use sleeping for 4 days, it had about 17% battery life remaining.  The old one slept for a couple weeks and still had a small charge if left unused.<br /><br />I am not sure what the HD does for you in a screen smaller than the old paperback books, the old 7-8&#34; Kindle was sharp, this one even sharper, HD.  Eyes can't discern the small details available, wide screen done miniature?  Beautiful colors from the display though!  Watching movies, a great choice.  Reading books, an adequate choice.  Planning a long trip with no plug-ins, leave it home and plugged in."
3.0,Does not work with my iMac on Yosemite 10.10.1
3.0,"The Kindle was a gift from my son and I am still getting to know it. I have ordered a new book with the upmost ease. My next project is to get connected with the library system. I need reading glasses, read in bed in the evening and find this is wonderful--no glasses and well lighted."
3.0,The corner pieces block the control tab.
3.0,"I had Anywhere mouse 1 for the last few years, as a general purpose netsurf, occasional 3D app use. Worked fine mostly inspite of the well-known flaws of double right click issue. Main attraction for me is wireless, works with unifying stick, has some extra buttons, side tilt, and relatively small size and flatness. But the weight with 2 AA batteries remain a wrist breaker for me. So I was super excited by the new Anywhere mouse 2 with no more battery. Imagine my shock when I found out - not only you need to install a new software (Logitech &#34;Options&#34;)that doesn't do anything the existing SetPoint doesn't do, you are allowed only ONE custom profile settings.  Logitech &#34;Options&#34;, with one option. Wow, seriously. Sadistic.  I thought, this can't be true, searched the net, there's a long thread on Logitech's own forum full of angry former Anywhere mouse owners, who feel misled, cheated, at least UNDER-informed. Whether this is yet another typical Logitech sales tactic (sell you a 70% okay 30% frustration product so you will buy another one soon hoping to solve your dilemma), or idiotic oversight, it is immaterial now. I've spent $100 on yet another piece of Logitech waste-ware. I can't return it because I found out more than a week later.  If like me you are seeking a light weight small form factor mouse with at least 5 programmable buttons, horizontal tilt, AND unique profile per application, don't get this. Until Logitech fix this issue. Or check out Microsoft Comfort mouse or Razer Orochi with similar feel and usage.  (UPDATED JANUARY 2016) Less than a month after this complaint Logitech has finally updated their software Logitech Options to include Per Application Profile functionality. Their existing Logitech SetPoint continues to act stupid and conflict with Logitech Options. But for now Anywhere 2 is usable again. Unfortunate for me, I spent another $80 on a corded multi-button gaming mouse since. From 1 star I added 2 more stars."
3.0,"Two issues:<br /><br />1.) When first installed, got nothing but BIOS POST beep code indicating no video card found - thought the card was DOA. Further research revealed that the board uses a Pericom bridge chip to nestle a PCI-E graphics implementation onto PCI-legacy board.  There appears to be no on-board BIOS extension ROM to assist this.  Some older BIOS, like my own, Award 1998-vintage 4.51PG version either does see the bridge, or just does not find the graphics hardware behind it, and so does not permit board use in BIOS display, DOS apps, nor Windows install.  The board is/was found & usable as a 2nd video card after Windows XP  startup,  however.<br /><br />2) The 15-pin VGA connector is placed very high on the standard height bracket. Mating plug may not find clearance beneath rolled-steel case opening at slot rear.  If you need the VGA connection, you may choose to hog out case, or bracket connector opening holes to provide additional clearance."
3.0,The case is OK - the problem is that the top part where the sleep button is - it gets stuck.... like the case pushes the button in and it stays pushed in.  It's all funky.  It would be great if it wasn't for that.
3.0,"Returned, it didn't fit the hard drive from my MacPowerbook. It was too thin."
3.0,"its okay but not what l needed, l need more GB and unfortunately l cannot update to Windows 10 from XP..also l can't play my games on Facebook, it is not fast enough, the games barely load and than they crash...its just not what l had hoped it would be, its okay to check my Emails and read the Reel on Facebook but thats pretty much it..."
3.0,I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Unfortunately it failed after 4 months.  I contacted SanDisk and they promptly sent me another.  It has been going strong for 6 months.
3.0,Works good. Only complaint is how hot it gets when using it.
3.0,"Received quickly, however, Toshiba misrepresents the size of these drives.  Stated as 5TB, but actually less than 4.5TB.  A 500MB error is unacceptable and makes me question Toshiba's QA.  The drive works correctly and was priced well. but I will never buy a Toshiba product again due to false advertising."
3.0,First one came broken. They replaced it no problem. Second one works great.
3.0,"I know brand new laptops aren't supposed to come with errors, but after an update, I continuously received blue screens with the error: &#34;PFN_LIST_CORRUPT&#34;. I'm pretty sure that error is difficult to remove, considering how many solutions I have tried but none have worked.<br /><br />Aside from the errors, the computer has wonderful performance. It isn't slow and none of the programs or apps fail. The CD/DVD drive works, the mousepad works, and sound work.<br /><br />It isn't the best laptop, but you can work with it."
3.0,"Gets the job done for my GoPro so that's good. I just never liked how small the actual card is due to its nature of it might just get lost...then that's game over. The price was amazing, so I got two for the price of half of one."
3.0,"This card does exactly what it should.  Class-10 performance at a fair price in a MicroSD format.  It should be faster though, and in fact there are options out there now at a nominally higher price that do, including the &#34;extreme&#34; versions from the same vendor."
3.0,"I ordered this in conjunction with a Excelvan 32GB Wi-Fi car black box/car DVR Recorder, as suggested by Amazon and customers..  The dash cam broke just days after the return policy time expired.  Now I have no use for this product either. The disk operated as expected, was hard to reinsert but still was able to be used.  The camera was the problem, leaving me with a disk for which I have no use. Of course that was the attraction, being able to record while driving and then download if needed."
4.0,"I have a love-hate relationship with screen protectors.  I cannot help but get frustrated when installing them.  They attract dust, yet the goal is to avoid dust getting under the screen protector.  I swear that is why they always sell you more than one at a time.  The first one just collects all of the dust so that the second one has a chance.  I was very frustrated after the first one, but with the second one there was only one speck of dust and the usual air bubbles.  I was able to work out most of the bubbles right away and thought I could live with one bubble around that spec of dust.  To my surprise, all of the bubbles in the display area are gone, a few minor ones near the edges, and the bubble around the dust is so small I have to strain to find it.<br />Pros:<br />You get two so that hopefully one of them makes in on without too much dust under it<br />Does reduce glare<br />Only marginally affects tactile response of touchscreen<br />Appears to work bubbles out on its own<br /><br />Cons:<br />You'll be cursing at how much dust it attracts.<br />I'm not an expert and I can't do a side-by-side comparison, but I think there is a little loss in clarity, but I knew that going into it and I think the glare reduction is worth it (glare was a distraction for me).<br />The cloths that came with it are poor. Use others<br />Don't use the tape they provide to try to pull dust off of anything - it left adhesive marks on my screen and failed to remove the dust from the protector.<br />Don't keep pulling up the screen protector to try to remove dust, see point above<br /><br />Oh, and shipping only took like 2 weeks from China, so not bad and well ahead of the planned delivery date."
4.0,"Nice, fast little &#34;phablet&#34;.  The screen is bright and crisp compared to other low cost Android tablets.  I used it as an HUD display for my car and worked perfectly."
4.0,for my son
4.0,Love the look and feel of this case.  Very slim profile.  Maybe it's just new and stiff but the standing feature is a challenge for me to get positioned correctly.
4.0,Wonderful for kids.
4.0,"This is a decent laptop fan. The build quality is basically feels really flimsy and not all that great, but it looks cool and I like the blue LED accent. There's 2 rotary dials in the back, one for the top two fans, and the other for the bottom two. However, if either dial is cranked all the way, all 4 fans will turn on and light up. I prefer to run fans like this at full power, so I don't mind the wonky power dials. The fans are powered by a full sized USB cable, which is included. Bonus - there's a USB port on the back so I don't lose a port just because of these fans. They function quietly and give decent air flow. There's two feet that angle the fans and my laptop, but the angle feels far too extreme to be of use to me. I think the price is a touch too high for what it is. I was given this free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,We live in a small ranch and needed the wifi to get from the furthest point.  It works.
4.0,I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.
4.0,Does its job.<br />Kinda tight until broken in but it is good.
4.0,"A bit expensive, but does what it should. I run two Zyxel access points off these and they work with no problems."
4.0,For the price gets the job done. Ended up tossing the keyboard cover- it smudges my screen.
4.0,Very good product at a good price and I had it in my hands in no time flat.
4.0,My husband bought this and said he likes it. He likes the clear window panel and fits his needs for mid size gaming tower.
4.0,"Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone's internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems."
4.0,"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!"
4.0,good value
4.0,Great Product. Easy to clean and keeps my computer cool!
4.0,"its not 5 stars because the battery life sucks. once in a while i have problem connecting while wireless. mine is still in perfect condition after 1 whole year of use and i game a lot, but its just the connection issue and battery life issue."
4.0,Works just fine in my tablet
4.0,I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.
4.0,"A good quality memory for smartphones and tablets,  comes with adapter for pc too"
4.0,Have had this for a few weeks now and it's worked perfectly so far. For the price you can't beat it!
4.0,"This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don't hesitate in buying this, it's a steal for the amount of storage you get."
4.0,"I like this screen cover, but it was impossible to get all of the bubbles out. Again, it is a great looking screen cover, you just might have to get a bit creative to get it completely smooth."
4.0,works good.
4.0,great deal
4.0,"perfect fit,but does not stick"
4.0,Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven't had any data loss or other issues.
4.0,"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own."
4.0,Very quiet.<br />Moves the air nicely.
4.0,good
4.0,Very quiet and it keeps my cpu cool even under loads like gtaV
4.0,It took a week to get it delivered but it kit was new and worked great.
4.0,"Great service and quick delivery.  However the product itself, though compatible with my laptop, can only charge to 95% and does not seem to provide the same charge life as the OEM.  Suits my purposes though."
4.0,Nice product. Relatively easy to install although the instructions are not intuitive.  Also there it is difficult to tell direction to physically place the screen protector.  The material seems very sturdy although have only had it for 5 days.
4.0,fit well as others have said connector is a little bit to long but other than that pleased with product
4.0,What I was expecting
4.0,"I like this mouse it works well, but is smaller than I would have prefered"
4.0,"Perfect for your needs if you don't require much. Holds charge well, great display, ads aren't too invasive."
4.0,"This is a nice keyboard, but it is extremely small and won't work as easily for people with bigger hands."
4.0,Good except no on /off when using the cover.
4.0,"Like the tablet and what it does, but its quirky and that is frustrating.  Especially concerning startup."
4.0,Great bag set. I get so many compliments. Few people also made a purchase. It's durable. But compact.
4.0,"Does what it should do. Packs a lot of features and reasonable screen quality in a very attractive price. Not very fast but hey, what do you expect for 40 bucks."
4.0,"Once I got less powerful batteries in the mouse, it worked great. I'd recommend buying cheap batteries (no big brand names). The mouse doesn't work with the more powerful batteries, for example, it didn't even turn on with Duracell. I like that it's small and light enough to pack in my work bag and turns off when it's collapsed."
4.0,good product
4.0,I bought these for my wife's computer.  She is Russian and it helps her when she types using some of the Russian language programs on her computer.  I had purchased these before for an older computer and she used it for a couple of years without any of these coming off or wearing out.  But when we replaced it she now has a new wireless keyboard.  They show up nice on black keys; they come in other colors for gray or light keys.  A nice item that makes life better for the wife; and you know that helps!
4.0,Worked as advertised.
4.0,"The price was right,  I bought two of them,  Of course i'm wishing they'd last longer but in reality i'm not complaining.  They came quickly three day delivery was plenty fast enough."
4.0,"The case fits perfectly and has protected my phone from several small drops. I don't think it would survive a serious impact or a toddler, but for the average mildly clumsy adult, the case provides great protection. The textured side makes it easier to keep a grip on the phone.<br /><br />This case is an excellent value. I wish it came in other colors, but I appreciate that it doesn't have a window on the back to show the Amazon logo like so many of the other cases that are compatible with my fire phone. Because seriously, Amazon - let's dial down the neediness a little, shall we? I don't need to advertise your product every time I use it."
4.0,Heats up. But works perfect for the price
4.0,"been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it's a memory card."
4.0,This works great and has kept the screen free of scuffs and scratches.
4.0,Works well however it seems to come out of the socket very easily so if bumped it goes flying.  Luckily I am using it as a power hub sitting in my basement to jacks that I installed in my kitchen.
4.0,"They worked with me and price matched the product, which I greatly appreciated. I really like the look and feel of the case. I ordered the mint green. It doesn't look cheap like some of the other cases that I ordered and then returned. The only thing that bothers me is that it picks up fingerprints very easily. My case has a lot of smudges on it now, and it's a hassle to constantly have to clean it. Even so, I would recommend this case."
4.0,its on
4.0,Works great.  I'd recommend it.  Easy to install.  No issues using it for about 2 months.
4.0,"Can't be beat for the price. A lot of claims about being under powered but I can run GTA V in full 1080P with mixed high and normal graphic settings. The only flaw, and is common for budget cards, is the fan is a little loud."
4.0,"I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn't really matter at least for Android phones. didn't really worth the price difference"
4.0,A+ purchase...can't beat the price!
4.0,"First off, companies need to mark these right, they consider 1000mb to be 1 gig, when 1 gig is actually 1024 mb.That means you will end up with 62 gb &#60; and in all actuality it will read as 59 gb in your device &#62;other then that this card works awesome. I would highly recommend it!one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data."
4.0,Love this 32gb micro sd card. I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I just returned from a 3 day trip where I used it as my camera/video recorder. I kept it on HD quality the whole time. No problems at all. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. If that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance!
4.0,"Relative needed a new sd card, an upgrade from her 8gb and this did the trick. Great for any phone."
4.0,"Very nice cover for the ipad air, great product."
4.0,"handy little flash drive, but the hinge doesnt seem like it will last forever... to be clear it hasnt broken on me, but I wouldve liked the hinge to be more substancial"
4.0,good product
4.0,"You guys literally brought my S3-391 back to the road!.<br />Although the instruction manual has no instructions at all, and its limited to warnings about avoiding nail the battery ( I still wonder the reasons behind someone would like to pierce a lithium container after all). I've never changed an internal battery, but that's not a real problem, just being careful and half and hour and it's done.<br />Also, the packaging is not that great, just foam and soft paperboard. I expected something more secure to transport a laptop component, it's not a critic, just a suggestion, maybe some bubble wrap and anti-static bag would be better.<br /><br />Finally, I had to ask a good friend of mine who made a business trip to the US to recieve the battery, cause BTExpert does not supply this product as international shipping item. This made some issues to set a specific adress and I was a little concerned because the product became disappeared a few days at the location, and my friend had to contact to USPS to ask for the person that received and signed to the delivery. I'm not against paying for int. shipment, but BTExpert even does not allow the option.<br /><br />In spite some issues, I recomend the product."
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,Great tablet but speakers are very quiet and not Loud
4.0,I never used this cover as gave the tablet to granddaughter. But it looked O.K.
4.0,Works well
4.0,"I got this for my Galaxy Note 3, as it accepts add on storage.  Works perfectly, and I use it to store all my music and files so I dont junk up the phones memory."
4.0,"Works well, is about the size of your hand, if not smaller. Works well but I wouldn't use it to play games."
4.0,Worked great. At the beginning one was a bit sticky in opening but it come around.
4.0,"Love it!! Very seldom does it give me any problems but, it was definitely a good buy. I can't seem to put it down because I am constantly reading. The apps I downloaded are great and work perfectly. I highly recommend it. *Be warned that it is small but don't let that defer you from purchasing one."
4.0,Very good option for the IPad for the price. Every one should have one of these.
4.0,Charger arrived very quickly and works just as advertised
4.0,"A fine product.  I've been using mine for over a year now, and it's never punked out on me.  I just bought another one, to use as a spare.  Delivered on time, reliable, priced fairly."
4.0,Wel made.
4.0,"The quality of the keyboard and mouse overall is great. The shape definitely helps your wrists and the keys have a god tactile feedback without being noisy. However the biggest negative with this is that the wrist pad starts turning white after a few months of use (possible due to skin oils) and doesn't really go off easily. There is no easy way to clean it and no instructions either. I used one of the alcohol wipes and that did a reasonable job, but for a keyboard at this price I would expect it to have a better quality pad."
4.0,GREAT ITEM
4.0,Easy use....self explanatory.
4.0,Its a little bit smaller than expected. But it is a child's back pack after all.  My grandson thought it was cool.  It appeared to be manufactured well.  Ask me i6 months.
4.0,"Got the card, took it out of the package, dropped it in my Samsung S4, rebooted and it detected it immediately.  No need to format or anything.  Haven't done any speed tests, but I haven't noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them, either."
4.0,"Good product, works great, and I like the holder for the charging cable underneath."
4.0,Works very well.  Would be nice if it had a hole in it to make it easier to charge while closed.
4.0,good product
4.0,Still working well after 2 months.
4.0,"Works very well for a non-power user.  Plenty sufficient for browsing, viewing videos, etc.  No need to spend more."
4.0,its nice...
4.0,This is the third one of these I've bought. Dog enjoyed eating the first two. The best value I've found for this item. No complaints at all.
4.0,Easy to use. I debated between this and the paperwhite. I read the most in bed so now I am wishing I had purchased the back lit paperwhite. I'm sure I will find a case for this one which has a light included or a separate light that will actually fit into the case.
4.0,smooth operation and handles detail work for Photoshop very well.
4.0,Nice product I recommend
4.0,"I did a ton of research before purchasing this. I had an ipad that just stopped working, and wanted to get a replacement --with a little more umph. Something I could use for more stuff, etc.  The apple laptops would have been ideal, but couldn't shell out the bucks. So looked for a windows alternative.<br />Overall very happy with this; have had it a couple months. They major (only really) issue that I have is that it indeed does drop a wifi signal a little too frequently. I saw that on previous reviews, and figured it was probably a local wifi problem--and maybe it is, but it is a problem. Upgraded to windows 10 thinking that might help, but not really.  It's not a deal breaker, as all you have to do is sign off wifi and sign right back on, but it is annoying.  (If there is a fix to this problem Id love to know it!)<br /> Aside from that, love how you can use the touch screen or mouse pad. I'm not a super-user, using it mainly for browsing, occasional documents, etc .  Fix the wifi issue and this is a VERY good small portable laptop."
4.0,it will perfect if come with 1 more dust filter at bottom
4.0,Just what i liked
4.0,"The technical side of the monitor is fine. It works well, everything goes as it should. My main issue is that the monitor does not sit parallel to the desk as cannot be repositioned in an easy way.<br /><br />When using two of these monitors in a dual-display setup, I have to work ridiculously hard to align them properly because of this positioning issue."
4.0,I bought this to use I'm my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. So far so good. Simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it
4.0,"I still recall the day I upgraded my 20GB Xbox 360 HD with a 100GB HD and thinking, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34; Fast forward 4 years, lots of Rock Band DLC and the ability to store full games to the HD and I find myself at about 90% full. Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process."
4.0,It does the work as supposed to
4.0,Tried this in my Gopro Silver camera. So for seems to work.Put card in Adapter to transfer files and had a very hard time removing it again. Will not try the adapter again with this card.
4.0,I bought this card for my Phone. It gave me the extra storage for my pictures and video that I needed.
4.0,"This does a very respectable job cooling, it keeps my i5-6600k nice and cool even at full load without having to spin too fast or make much noise.<br /><br />The downside is that it is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE to install in a confined space. If you are building a new machine with this I would strongly recommend installing this before anything else and probably before mounting your motherboard, otherwise this is a fantastic cooler for the price."
4.0,"Works well, as advertised. I like the Class 10 speed. Price was right. Would recommend this product to others. Thank you."
4.0,"This is really a 4.5 star review. Fits the new Macbook very well and looks like wool. It does add a little bulk to the Macbook, as the seams take up about 1/2&#34; more room side-to-side in a purse than a naked Macbook. Still, it is lightweight, attractive, and affordable. I have no plans to use anything else."
4.0,No problems so far.
4.0,"I had to return this and get another one, as the first was faulty. I hear this is semi-common.Must not have enough testing, i might suggest buying two and returning one if you are in desperate or sudden need of one of these chips, no matter what size."
4.0,"This card reader gets pretty good performance compared to the nominal ratings for the cards I tried in it.<br /><br />I was hoping that the part that swings around would act as a cover for the USB side when it was not plugged in.  It fails there -- the swinging part does not stay in position at all.  When in use, the part that swings around just gets in the way, and since it won't stay in place protecting the USB connector when the reader is not in use, I really don't know what good it does.<br /><br />At least the lid over the slots protects the cards.<br /><br />However, because the card is completely enclosed in this, high-performance cards tend to run quite warm.  I have not seen card failures from this yet, so I do not know how much it affects the cards.  The device itself gets warm too, even with lower speed cards.<br /><br />I do like that the light indicates activity."
4.0,all good!
4.0,Very useful when in the office or traveling. I just wish the cord were a wee bit longer.
4.0,Good price.
4.0,Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn't let me down yet and no errors.
4.0,"I am charging an iphone 5s with an apple adapter and it takes several hours to get a full charge. I am very disappointed in this charger.  Great customer service. They reached out to me and after expressing the issue I had with it not charging right, offered to replace it no problem. I am impressed with the service and feel better about trying another product."
4.0,"Perfect for someone with a small hand. Just plug in the remote sensor to the USB port and pair the mouse with mouse. Remember to press one of the buttons to wake it up after pairing.  I have this for a week now, it saves battery by automatically turn off the unit after a period of inactivity. (I did not time it.) You wake it up by pressing any of the buttons. Appears to be well built."
4.0,"First off, I've always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk's lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China."
4.0,Nice
4.0,"Like it a lot, however, the wrist portion isn't holding up as well as I thought it would.  Has gotten pretty squished down but I've had it almost a year.  Still like it."
4.0,I purchased this product for a discounted price in order to give an honest review.  I have a 2015 Macbook Pro and it works with it.  It easily connects ethernet cables to my usb port!  My Macbook doesn't have an ethernet port so this product is very handy!  I definitely recommend it.
4.0,"Totally satisfied with display right out of the box -- color, brightness and contrast are great.  Will probably play with customization later, then again may not bother.<br /><br />Installation was annoying.  Comes with the now-common 1-page sheet with pictures on it and no written instructions.  I disconnected old monitor and plugged in new one, the background graphic popped right up.  But that was all.  No icons or taskbar.  Put in installation CD and nothing happened.  Opened File Explorer to try to manually run set up but still nothing on screen except the background.  Fortunately had a laptop handy so was able to access the User Manual on the CD.  Its install instructions mentioned that it was important to turn on computer AFTER turning on the monitor, something the simplistic pictures on the Quick Start Guide didn't even hint at.  But that was the solution, this time screen came up normally with icons and all.<br /><br />Running the Viewsonic setup went smoothly until last step.  Got message that drivers couldn't be automatically installed, needed to do it manually.  Going into manual setup though, only option it gave me was to install Windows 7 & Vista drivers.  I'd recently upgraded to Windows 10, suspect this was the reason.  As everything seems to be working fine with whatever default drivers it's using, not a problem.<br /><br />Checked Viewsonic website to see if I really needed Win 10 drivers.  Couldn't get into their drivers download page, kept getting sent to a page-not-found screen which even mentions one reason you're there might be because they moved the content somewhere else.  Now hoping I never need to deal with their Tech Support."
4.0,"The case is what I expected.  Very similiar to my Otterbox for my Samsung Cell phone.  Gives the Kindle Fire 6HD a little more heft to it, and makes it easier to handle.  Also has the protective screen, which works well with the Kindle's touch screen."
4.0,"stil not getting the write speed as I need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card!"
4.0,Holds up well. Using in car for 7inch tab 4
4.0,The charge doesn't last quite as long as advertised but the light works well & clips onto my book making reading in bed enjoyable without disturbing my spouse asleep next to me.
4.0,"This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected."
4.0,I've used Sandisk cards for as long as they have existed. These cards are fast and have the solid quality I expect from Sandisk. Recommend.
4.0,Very good
4.0,The only drawback that I can assign to these SD cards is the limit of a 5 year warranty unlike Kingston.
4.0,Pretty solid tablet thus far. Only about a week old and only freezes up a little bit every once in awhile. But everything mechanical seems to work fine. Especially for the price.
4.0,It's a good keyboard but there trackpad seems touchy and the keys slightly lightweight for my taste.  Also the range wasn't enough for cross room distances for the build I did - s0 it went back.  Replaced with MacAlly (Hackintosh build).
4.0,My fiance has had this in his tablet for almost a year now without a single issue. I feel that it's one of the best quality memory cards we've ever had. Make SURE you get the retail packaging and not the &#34;frustration-free.&#34; The retail packaging only requires one quick clip of the scissors and it's worth it to get one that is sealed in a package and not at risk to be damaged.
4.0,Good product
4.0,Does the job
4.0,Works better than expected.
4.0,Works great. Only problem is that if i put the card in a multi car reader it does not read the car. Has to be put in a SD CARD ONLY reader to work and be read by computer
4.0,It works in my Note 2 smart phone. I don't think there is much else you can say about it.
4.0,It has all worked as expected
4.0,Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked right away with no troubles.  Only time will tell. :)
4.0,Used it in an android phone. Worked fine and is decently fast. It did not quite reach the rated speeds but came close (could just be the controller that I am using).
4.0,Excellent
4.0,The M1210 doesn't see this unit as  producing sufficient power to charge the batter and produces a bios message indicating a 65W Dell charger is needed - but you can ignore the message and it works fine though it doesn't show that it is charging the batter (which I don't use anyway).
4.0,"I purchased this backpack for myself since I enjoy hiking often and my current bag isn't waterproof. The backpack had great straps for carrying lots of heavy stuff. I threw a bunch of water bottles in it, food, clothes, shoes, food for my dogs and more and there was still tons of room. It has a wonderful amount of pockets.  The bag was so heavy, yet still very comfortable to wear. It is indeed waterproof and rugged.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that the inside label has  a mistake on it. On the place where you put your personal info, there are marks on it for the number area, so that's no help if I happen to leave it somewhere. You can see that in my photos. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I love this! I'll be using this backpack for a long time. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"love the neat size and legibility. i do wish it had colour though. bought it thinking it would be good for graphic novels, books with art illustrations etc.  So less than six months later I've got a damaged screen, probably my own fault because i placed it in my bag without pulling the cover down. Something probably pressed against the screen and now i've got a blank area in the top left corner which basically makes it unreadable. Sigh. I need a new screen now."
4.0,"Really enjoying this system for what i bought it for, Basically email, social media, streaming Netflix to my TV.  I am NOT using it for any real business applications.  It seems lightning fast, simple and easy to use for what I am doing with it.  I did notice that on some TV shows that had a lot of dark clothing and backgrounds that the Black looked a little weird.  A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn't have one going into the purchase so I can't ding it for not having one.  I would absolutely recommend, in fact I already have recommended it to some friends, and bought a second unit for my girlfriend."
4.0,"Works great with the RK3288 Android TV Stick and lets me plug in multiple USB items to it.  However, it did not work with the new Remix Ultratablet.  Not sure if it would work with other Android based tablets or not."
4.0,"Solid fit for automotive (bouncy) use, and perfect length for my application."
4.0,I have been playing with the Fire and seem to know how to do what I want it to do.<br />I really like my Fire.
4.0,Works great!
4.0,"I like it. I had a Kindle fire which lasted several years, so my expectations are high. So far it's been fine. I have noticed playing games it has a tendacy to not respond to touch at times. It passes seconds later but could cost you the game depending on what game you're playing. I have no other issues with it."
4.0,Product good but for someone who'snever used a screen saver before the iinstructions are very vague and I wasted two of them trying to figure it out
4.0,"It is as advertised.  I had the 7&#34; Samsung tablet and now the 10&#34;.  The screen size more than doubled.  I like that.  Otherwise it's the same, just bigger."
4.0,i like it very fast
4.0,My T100 Transformer read the card immediately. Nice and compact storage solution. Does the job and you won't be disappointed.
4.0,"No complaints matched description, was delivered on time and works well. Would easily recommend this to anyone looking to memory for their mobile device etc"
4.0,"Works just fine, did the job as advertised at a good priced."
4.0,"Rally like it, it got here in a week charges great and is very cheap and made from good material."
4.0,I find San Disk always to be a good choice for storage options. Capacity and performance are always top notch.
4.0,:)
4.0,"the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems."
4.0,"First off, these fans look amazing. If you want your computer hardware to shine and stay cool, these fans should do the trick. Both of the fans I purchased worked out of the box. But, I'm not sure if the screws are too big or the holes are too small, or both. I had some other fan screws that fit nice and snug, but the new ones didn't go all the way in, if you know what I mean."
4.0,"Price was right, shipping quick, Class 10 card for HD video in my GoPro.Hard to rate it since memory cards are pretty much memory cards. Nothing jumps out as excellent so that is why 4 of 5."
4.0,"Cables work as intended. Have a few extra left over for other projects down the road. Good size, right fit!"
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,It works thanks for the electrical charge for my Surface Pro 2
4.0,"Even though it's a class 10 card, writing data to it still takes a while. However, the card performs well in my phone. If you can get a good deal on this, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"I like the shaver, I have fine facial not always get it all, however I still learning how to use and work with product."
4.0,does it's job
4.0,It works as advertised.
4.0,does not last as long as expected for such a big batterry
4.0,Good
4.0,"Cable gets the job done at a cheap price, it does feel very cheap as well, but it works so who cares."
4.0,Does a great job of protecting my tablet and providing a stand for viewing.
4.0,Love the Kindle Paperwhite. I wish you were able to change the text and background color.
4.0,Whats not to like? It is what it is. I always buy this brand of cards and drives. They have never failed me.
4.0,"did not ocme exactly how it look like in picture the buttons &#34;w,s,a,d,up,down,left,right&#34; are all blue."
4.0,"It fits perfectly and is much easier to use the tablet,"
4.0,I'm not sure that the quality is as long-lasting as an Apple product.  but it worked well on several older devices mating the new I phones with the lighting connector to the speaker box.
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,This is a pretty good case and I am happy with it. Wish it had some more protection Around the edges but overall it's good.
4.0,could have been longer
4.0,good product
4.0,"I was on vacation in Hawaii when my iPad charger crapped out.  Instead of paying $75 for an apple charger locally, I bought this one.  Feels light, however it gets the job done."
4.0,"Bought it for my tablet.  it works well, and it has been working now for about 6 months.  I have no complaints."
4.0,NOTE: This doesn't seem to work with a Dremel Idea Builder 3D printer. It DOES work great in everything else I've tried it with.
4.0,good for price
4.0,"I used this Memory Card to Expand the Memory in my Smartphone. It worked as expected and was easy to setup. I copied the Stuff from my older MicroSD Card to my computer, changed cards, gave it a couple of minutes to Initialize, and copied the stuff back... Worked great."
4.0,"Be aware--if you want to use this device to record and play high-definition video with files greater than 4gb, you'll need to format the card as exFAT or NTFS (if you want to play the files on either a PC or a Mac. But it works well after properly formatting."
4.0,"Solid build, works as advertise so far."
4.0,I'm finding more and more electronics are using micro SD cards.So I'm stocking up. Good buy for the price.
4.0,Works as advertised.
4.0,"Worked immediately after I inserted.29.71 GB recognized, doesn't really bug me but I wish I got the full 32."
4.0,"Using this in my Samsung G3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion. it works ok for now, allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity. I hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes. I have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card. or any other error messages. Overall minus the slight issues it works great."
4.0,Great
4.0,"Why I made this purchase: Needed something smaller than my backpack to take inside my workplace. Pros: Manageable size fits two AC cords, a sandwich, keys and my Kindle, and I don't look like I'm carrying a purse. Cons: Dislike faux straps and small snaps on lower straps that are labor intensive to secure the flap. But this is not a deal breaker. I would purchase again."
4.0,Good item
4.0,"Nice, except it take getting used to the separate number keypad."
4.0,Good no problems I'm happy with it
4.0,I have been using it for over a year now in my galaxy S3 and it seems fast and reliable.  Do we really know how good they are until it goes out or crashes?
4.0,What can I say...it's a memory card.  Aren't they all the same?  No problems or issues with this product.  It works as described!
4.0,Fast and strong.  It should have come with rubber accessory for free.  Comes with one usb cable.
4.0,"I am very happy with this purchase.  I was originally looking for just a skin to give my macbook pro some personality, but decided on a hard shell case.  I wish I would have had it long ago before the time my son tripped over the cord and pulled my MacBook down onto one of its corners resulting in minor damage.  The shell has protected my MacBook well during a couple of other drops and slips since I put it on.<br /><br />The keyboard skin is very cute and I get a lot of compliments on it.  The only reason I took a star away to give only 4 stars is because the skin has a bubble in it and doesn't sit on the space bar as well as it could."
4.0,"I like my device to have enough storage so I finally purchased the 64GB version. Formatted the card and haven't fun into any kind of problem. Inserted it into my Samsun Galaxy 8 tablet, now it's complete."
4.0,Love that Finite makes different designs and that the grooves are pretty deep to hold the IPad Air up. That's why I bought the case. But...the auto awake and shut off does not work with my case and not sure why. So I have to set auto-lock in the iPad settings just so it shuts off with inactivity.
4.0,"It's very tiny and copying file fast. The only problem is, after connecting to the computer, it get really hot."
4.0,Good range. Have not lost my connection since I switched to this router.
4.0,"Works with my Nikon D3200 camera and also my HP laptop, but for some reason my friend's laptop (Dell) would refuse to recognize it/acknowledge its existence. Not sure if it was the card, the adapter, the computer, the port, or what. Card should work fine for anything, I think."
4.0,"I debated between 3 and 4 stars because on one hand this is a far from perfect tablet, but on the other hand we only paid $60! We bought this for our 3.5 year old daughter and we're mostly happy with it.<br /><br />Likes:<br />Super kid friendly hardware, durable, and great size for little hands<br />Zoodles app is okay (see dislikes) it is very easy for a kid to learn, my daughter had it down in less than 10 minutes<br />Lots of apps available for kids, many of them free<br />My daughter loves the recorded story books, it comes with one for free and it's pretty cheap to buy more<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />The biggest one is Zoodles will just stop working sometimes dumping my daughter out into unmonitored, unfiltered, tablet land.<br />I can't get Netflix to work within the Zoodles app (if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong I love to hear!)<br />The power cord is really finicky there have been many times we thought we had it plugged in just to find it wasn't and the tablet was dead the next day.<br />I wish instead of an app I could create a kid account on the computer so I wouldn't have issue one.<br /><br />All in all, it was worth the $60. I recommend getting the carrying case that Amazon recommends with it as well for safe travel."
4.0,Easy to hook up. Works great!
4.0,Good performance and quality.
4.0,Good inexpensive case. Solid. Looks good. Replaced fans as the included pair were no sufficient for the CPU and MB I installed. No fault of the manufacturer. Included USB ports and media card reader nice feature and work well.
4.0,"Very quiet but not as powerful for one of the few 360mm in the market right now. For $140, it doesn't come with rgb lighting or any lights for that matter or the software to control these fans. It is well constructed however and keeps my overclocked 4690k @4.5ghz @ under 55C under heavy loads (which is actually just 5-6C less than my hypo evo 212 cooler ). i wish it had a stronger pump but then it would be a little louder so there's that.<br /><br />I give 4/5 BUT would not buy again"
4.0,Still getting used to it.
4.0,"Works great as intended. Unfortunately, we purchased this for the Surface Pro 3. The USB port on the Surface does not put out enough power for this product to operate. Very handy to use otherwise. Easy transport, very light."
4.0,It was good except it was a little bent so it doesn't fit snug.
4.0,"Well built, was slightly disappointed that their is only one power switch. Would love to be able to shutdown just one drive at a time to swap it while the other drive is still in use."
4.0,Some of the letters have worn off after about a year of use.
4.0,i love the case but sometimes it falls over and is hard to stand up without support other than that  the case is perfect
4.0,Handsome cover and protector for my iPad Air.
4.0,"It works, semi easy to install"
4.0,This case provides bare minimum protection to my Kindle but allows it to be inserted in stand purchased elsewhere.
4.0,everything good. thise is my second purchase of 32GB card.
4.0,Nice fit priced maybe a little high?
4.0,It's going to work perfectly for my trip.
4.0,Works well
4.0,"Great Card but poor packaging don't understand why these manufactures seem to think that putting all this plastic wrap all over the cards is good, anyway the card is high quality sturdy and quick to save and pull information from on my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3"
4.0,Great item.
4.0,good product
4.0,"Now I'm able to watch a movie or tv show, without looking at the time. Love it."
4.0,"I've used a lot of different brands over the many years of gaming, and this mouse is a very solid choice. I have larger hands and I love the feel of this mouse, I do however like Logitech's ergo feel better. This will be my 3rd Deathadder over the many years, and this one is on par with the older models. Better laser and the click feels more like a mechanical keyboard to me.. but maybe thats because its brand new and it's been awhile since I've used the older Deathadders. Razer software is pretty good, but there are a couple bugs when syncing with Blackwidow Chroma or turning off the lights when you shut the computer off. Low natural acceleration makes it great for precision.<br /><br />All in all, I find it to be one of the best FPS mice out there. Great all around mouse too, and fair competitive pricing for gaming mice."
4.0,works great
4.0,Poor quality forever and ever to come.
4.0,"While I have verified that the cable works with my meter, I have not yet used it to download data from the meter, since I am still using my old meter till it's supplies run out."
4.0,"Dirty computers look better, overall."
4.0,"This case is beautiful and easy to put on! The apple logo cutout is a tiny bit too far to one side, but hardly noticeable. Very happy with this!"
4.0,It's good for a cheap speaker
4.0,"Great idea, but quality control is an issue. I use external drive readers all the time, as I own a small PC repair business. I have owned many external adapters. The flat design made much more sense than the typical upright design, so I bought 3 of these to use in the shop. Out of the box, one failed. No problem, company exchanged it. After a couple of months, 2 of them started having problems. At this point, one works fine, one powers on the drive, but will not read it, one does nothing. So out of 4 of these , one was DOA, 2 did not last 6 months. I like the design, and will look for something manufactured with more care.  Update: Update. Inateck reached out to me and acknowledged the problem.  I received replacement units today. I'll update after using them for a bit"
4.0,"Very straightforward router to set-up and install. I have Macs, so could not use the installation CD provided (it's a mini-CD that can't be loaded into the CD drives on my laptop/desktop).  That said, it was still easy to go online to TP-Link's website and download the driver software update and then complete the set-up through a web-browser.<br /><br />Signal strength is good for what I need, even with the router hidden away inside a very solid-wood secretary desk.  No issues with random restarts or spotty connections so far.<br /><br />There are also iPhone and Android apps for setting up and managing the router, which look pretty nice (although I haven't had to use it much so far since everything has been working well). I think you could get this set up with the app without having to connect another computer to the router, but didn't try that myself."
4.0,Works as stated. Pretty easy to set up. Have to restart it from time to time but that's normal with almost any wireless device. It hasn't blown me away with performance but it's reliable and has a constant signal which is nice because before the reception was all over the place. Definitely worth the low price point.
4.0,Functionality is what I wanted and received
4.0,Extended Life Battery for a lesser price.
4.0,Product is so great and light weight. Easy to use and simple to angle in any direction. Love It
4.0,Product seems to be working properly.. the only bad part was the delivery time. :S
4.0,"Very sturdy cover. Easy to access ports, speakers, etc. Highly recommended."
4.0,"Use it (with the included adapter) as a spare card for my Panasonic FZ200 Lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my MacBook Pro laptop (which has a standard SD slot). Also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an iMac. Works exactly like a full-size SD card for these purposes. Very fast and reliable data transfers. And the special price from Amazon made these cards less costly than the standard 32 GB card at the time.UPDATE: I have changed the star rating from a 5 to a 4. This micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder. It still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop iMac. But often it will not mount in the laptop. This could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case, I will restore this to a 5-star rating."
4.0,Does what its supposed to do
4.0,Charges a little slower than
4.0,I unlocked this CPU to enable the 4th core and its performing well.
4.0,I just installed it and working OK so far
4.0,Nice reading!
4.0,"Fits great, not loose or floppy. Love the color. Glad I bought it!"
4.0,"I have had the product for a week or two now and it was acting just fine, and it still is for the most part.  My only issue with it in the rubber on the scroll wheel is coming off!  It isn't completely off, just barely, but it is enough that it irritates me while scrolling.  Other than that it seems decent enough."
4.0,Had to give it 4 stars because when formatted it only provides 28GB.  Not as clean as I would have expected a SanDisk product to be.  Especially a Class 10 product.
4.0,good price for good product
4.0,"This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while there cheep! I got mine for around $30."
4.0,"I've had this mouse since 2013, and just now the middle mouse button is not responding as often as it should.  Everything else works like a charm.  It's been through everything, from click marathons in Diablo 3, ragefests in CS:GO/TF2, to Witcher 3 and then some.  My favorite mouse to this day by far."
4.0,"I bought two of these shell cases: the green & the red. Items arrived quickly (in 5 days). The covers snapped on in seconds & fit perfectly. The colors were a little bit off from the seller's pictures. The green is more like lime green & the red, as one reviewer said, is more of an orangey red. Not that big of a deal. Quality is okay. [[ASIN:B00QH8PCA2 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Green)]] and [[ASIN:B00QH8S5R4 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Red)]]"
4.0,I got this for my Galaxy S 2 phone and it worked right away. I had an issue with the write times slowing down after a month so I issued an exchange. It came promptly and my new SD card works great.
4.0,Worked out great. My granddaughter loves it.
4.0,Bought this as last ditch effort to save my hard disk data from non working laptop Dell N5010. It worked really well with my hard disk. Was able to read all the data. Worked like a charm.<br /><br />Thanks!
4.0,Easy and quick set up. Decent quality for the low price.
4.0,"Only received it a few days ago and so far, works great. Will update if the battery craps out.<br />The battery was nicely sealed in a static bag, but it smelled a little like fish, despite being totally clean. Dunno what's up with that."
4.0,Easy to navigate- user friendly. The social feature makes it more than an average ebook reader!
4.0,"My soundcard blew out on my laptop, so I had to get on of these to have my headphones work.  I don't like having all kinds of things flopping off of my laptop, but this is a much cheaper option than sending it in for a repair.  The sound quality is good, virtually no setup involved."
4.0,"I use for my 8-inch AT&T Trek tablet. I wanted protection in my pocketbook, but I didn't want weight. I did cut off the handles, which for my purposes were unnecessary. It's light weight, and I can even stick a small Bluetooth keyboard in the case as well."
4.0,"Gave my Apple laptop about 4 hours up time. Probably not up to what could be provided by an Apple battery, but OK for my limited needs."
4.0,"Great tablet/laptop. Wish it had at least 2 USB ports but I guess I can spend a little and buy a hub, and also a external DVD/ blue ray drive. Great purchase would recommend it for anyone who needs a tablet but also needs a full on Windows system."
4.0,"I am using the 64 GB card in a Galaxy Note II phone and have had the card working perfectly from March to October. The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly.Then one day I decided to protect my data prior to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone.The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don't know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SanDisk has shown itself to have great customer service and I really appreciate them exchanging the card. I will definitely not encrypt it anymore. When card works, it works super fast and reliably."
4.0,"A good value.  It was easy to set up, I had it running in less than 15 minutes.  It does a nice job of extending my wifi range in my home."
4.0,This mouse is great little mouse. i like the shape and the buttons. The scroll wheel works well and the dpi switch works fine. I am a male and have a large size glove hand (I don't wear them when mousing) and this mouse is unfortunately too small for me to use comfortably. I kept searching for a good position and was either too far forward or too far back. About 15% to 20% bigger and it would be perfect for me. For anyone with a medium or smaller hand I am sure it would be great.
4.0,"This is a 'set-it-and-forget-it' item. Solid performance without issues. I forgot it is still in my Sony camera, Love it"
4.0,This would have 5 stars but it's little to no padding on the bottom.  The inside is very soft and plush on the sides with lots of padding.  The bottom however is just the fabric. I feel they messed up with that.  I am going to try and find a piece of foam to glue along the bottom.  I have an hp specter x360 and it's a 13in laptop so lots of room.  I also have the Amazon basics sleeve.  I put the laptop into the sleeve and the sleeve into this bag and things fit great.
4.0,"It worked great, good quality cable"
4.0,"Very Fast<br />No issues, but there should be something that describes why ACR and SMART VIEW hurts some eyes..<br /><br />Also, there are some options on the monitor that are greyed out.-.<br /><br />Overall GREAT PRODUCT though :D"
4.0,I use this with my GoPro 3+ Black. It works well. It'd be nice if it came with a little USB 3.0 reader like some other brands.
4.0,Little hard to put together but works great
4.0,"It is a nice tablet. It works good, it is fast. Does everything I want it to do."
4.0,A bit over priced. Working well tho.
4.0,"Instructions are not clear but after fiddling around with it for half the day, I finally got it to work. (I was recording from a VHS recorder to my PC) This after a dozen unsuccessful email exchanges with customer support. The order in which you load the software and connect the adapter is key. Once I got it running it worked perfectly."
4.0,"I love it. Games, videos, books and email all in one place. Perfect size and lightweight."
4.0,9 inch respond when I need it I love it is working good just make sure you shut down the system are you save all your power if you leave it on keep on running it will drain the battery but otherwise no complain
4.0,good product
4.0,Very helpful.
4.0,I hate you can not get all the apps out there you can even just for android. No disney no genie go for my dish. Great tablet my kids both love them except they can not get certain things like games mom has on her phone that they are not allowed to touch.
4.0,"This paired well with my WD black hard drive. Plug and play, pretty much as easy as it gets. The unit does get a quite warm after extended use though"
4.0,Didn't try that much but overall the speed better than my old class 10 SD Card
4.0,Cute and packaged really nice but the head is pretty lose when you put it back together so don't lose his bottom half!
4.0,"It's cheap, and priced appropriately.<br />Nothing wrong with it; comes with a single LED fan. Perfectly normal case.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Costs about $20<br />- One blue LED fan<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Aesthetically boring<br />- Small, tight<br />- Heavy considering its small size"
4.0,"2 years' use from mine so far, with no issues. Runs whatever I plug into it, never makes anything give me a 'low power from port' warning. Never causes any problems when hot-swapping stuff. It's on par with the Belkin hubs from back in the day. Best powered hub for the value, IMO."
4.0,"durable leather handle, the plastic stand underneath the leather handle is a little fragile that broke quickly."
4.0,it serves the purpose i bought this chip for my daughter she says it's okay
4.0,great
4.0,"Lives up to its claims.  Quietest click I ever heard from keyboard or mouse.  It cannot possibly bother anyone nearby.<br />My only complaint is that the scroll wheel hangs up slightly at one point in its rotation.  I like that it goes into low-power mode by itself, as I could never remember to turn off other mouses when I wasn't using them, although I do have trouble remembering I need to click it to get it reactivated.<br />Great product.  And inexpensive for the feature of diminshed complaints from others in the house."
4.0,Great buy and durable.
4.0,very good
4.0,"The advertisement calls this card a ""class 10"" card however I was not able to get ""class 10"" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s. However, if you are thinking of getting this memory card for an Android phone and don't want to pay big bucks, this is your card. Stop reading and buy it, I'm glad I did."
4.0,"Once I figured out the S3 wasn't liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat32 it works quite well. I don't know if it's the phone or card and I'm not about to test it elsewhere, but I didn't see the 30MB/s speeds. It works good enough for the phone and it's the best option I have for the biggest storage for now.1080P videos with no issues. No problems with read/write stability. Overall I'm happy I bought it."
4.0,Fine replacement. Dont expect big difference in battery life UNLESS you have many bad cells in your original battery.
4.0,Pretty good reception all around the house.  Does have interference with baby monitors.
4.0,"I bought this for my Galaxy S4 to expand the memory capacity a bit more. It works as it is intended to do, fast transfer rate, no problems so far."
4.0,"Good combo.  Definitely not the best but for the price it's absolutely wonderful.  Sometimes the keyboard lags but it's not often.  I wish the buttons were more flat similar to the Logitech solar keyboard or apple keyboard but again, for the price it's a great combo.  If you are on a budget, buy it!  Oh and it worked instantly without having to run any setup wizard on a windows 10 computer."
5.0,"Purchased my first iPad & ordered several different cases from Amazon to decide on the one I preferred best.  I was interested in this case, but after reading the reviews was concerned it might be a little too thick & clunky.  As a result, I ordered a thin smart cover case (Khomo Dual Super Slim) and another rotating case (Fintie) that looked very similar but for considerably less money.<br />My observations:<br />Khomo Dual Slim Case -- for me this was just to thin & did not provide the added protection of the Targus or Fintie. It was a Smart Cover & did put the iPad Air to sleep. If you don't want any bulk & no features except putting your case to sleep, this may work well for you. It has over 10,000 reviews & is well rated, but it's not for me.<br /><br />Fintie 360 Rotating Case -- looks very similar from the outside but clearly did not feel or behave like the Targus rotating case. It felt a bit less heavy and the grooves that allow the tablet to sit in landscape mode were not as deep, not as many grooves, & did not feel as stable in the groove when compared to the Targus. In portrait position, both the Targus & the Fintie are less secure in position when compared to landscape mode. The Fintie  tablet seemed a bit more wobbly in Portrait position than the Targus.  I use Portrait mode mainly for Face-Time.<br /><br />Targus case -- I have used this case for 6 weeks now & am certain I made the best decision for my needs!<br />Sleep mode does not hesitate when you close the cover. I appreciate the elastic band that keeps the case closed. I use a stylus touch pen that has a clip & leash (Friendly Swede available on Amazon) & I clip the pen to the band instead of using the provided sleeve because it's quicker & easier.  I could take or leave the business card holder. I probably would prefer if this feature was omitted and one more groove added.  Since it's there, I find that a business card tends to bend when you try to insert one. My work around is to insert an oldplastic (like credit card) gift card and then put in a couple of business cards on top. It slides easier. I can also insert a small microfiber cloth in- between these cards so it's there when needed.  No difficulty in rotating, although I do steady the tablet when in Portrait mode.  The stitching seems well done, no loose threads noted inside or out.  The corners seem well protected & it's easy to access the volume & power switches as well as charging port.<br />I primarily use Landscape mode & LOVE the fact that the tablet will stay in this position securely while I tap on the keyboard or use gestures on the touch screen. It is rock steady.  For my purposes, it is neither too thick, heavy, or cumbersome.  I appreciate the extra protection for this expensive device!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this case & would certainly look to Targus for any future cases I may need to purchase."
5.0,"Decent price on 16 GB. Works as it should, no problems. Not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices. Maybe for transferring media to PC faster actually helps. Either way, it works great."
5.0,"I have been using it for over a month now, works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Excellent speed, Do recommend it."
5.0,"Excellent. Love the size, weight & speed. The swipe is a great bonus.  Haven't used the camera at this point, but trust it will be satisfactory. Have already recommended this Fire HDX to others."
5.0,This product works fast and is very reliable. The capacity is huge. I use it in my tablet and in my phone and can carry lots of pictures and videos. Highly recommended.
5.0,the best machine ever!
5.0,"It is as advertised, is in my Tab at the moment and have it about 75% full with no problems!"
5.0,"All i can say for now since i have yet to use them is, they showed up on time very fast, as well each came wrapped in a small paper packet that is small enough to fit in your pocket. Secondly If these are the right ones i believe they will be excellent since based on the info and exp. i know from other ones i have used. I got them as gifts for other people so i have not had a chance to notice much. Hope this helped."
5.0,I got 2 of these for training room displays. They look good and work great.
5.0,"Still working...fast. It's almost a mind-fart to think we can put this much (much more now of course) storage in such a tiny little space. Come on, I remember in the 90's when a 3 Gigabyte hard disk was $300!!! That was soooo expensive even considering inflation.This card, is much, much, much faster than my first 3 GB hard drive...sad...but cool...wait....ouch, headache!"
5.0,lots of memory and it come with the adapter that makes it easer to connect to your computer or other devices.
5.0,"I worried that I wouldn't like a smaller Kindle Fire, but I love it and the improvements that have been made."
5.0,I have always been pleased with the SanDisk products and this one is no exception. It works as advertised. I would purchase it again.
5.0,"it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install."
5.0,"I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card."
5.0,Love it.
5.0,Works like advertised!
5.0,I have been using this cover for nearly 2 months and until now I have no any problem. It’s thin and besides the port for charging is easy to use. Great for the cost.
5.0,"I needed to get more space on the SD card in  my phone, so naturally! I turned to a product I know for its quality and attention to details.  I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again."
5.0,good~~
5.0,Edit: Changed my one star review to a 5 star review. Plugable support is unreal. They sent me two new working units to replace my two units that ended up being defective. Incredible. OUTSTANDING!
5.0,very happy w/product would buy again
5.0,"As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk!"
5.0,"I installed these on my Samsung Note 3 and S4 and have not had a single issue. Plenty of space for music, photos, videos, and apps."
5.0,"Works great, Plug & PlayLoads of room for whatever your needs are.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.Great card, Great price!"
5.0,What can you say? Intel is always solid. Great cpu.
5.0,"As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0."
5.0,"Samsung Galaxy Note can't read this card, have to be format in Fat32. Just Google the small program to do the trick. Work perfect."
5.0,"As stated above, and not a bad price.  Bought this thing in hopes of using it with my Ztpad C93 tablet, and it works like a charm.  The card is very fast for what it is and I have not had any problems with it to date."
5.0,"simple, easy and effective. great adapter"
5.0,Works well for the iPhone.
5.0,Bulletproof memory card!  Fast and decently priced.
5.0,"Purchased this item for a LePan TC970 tablet. All I can say is, &#34;Works great!&#34;Okay, and so I have to type 5 more words on this review so that I can post it."
5.0,"Inexpensive and works fine, almost no noise at all, I like the big and quiet fan that have, runs fine with my MSI Pc-Mate, i5 Intel, GTX 960 SSC, 1 optical drive and 3 HDD..."
5.0,Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price.
5.0,"Great computer.  Pricey, but top notch."
5.0,"Had had this for about 6 months now and it's in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven't had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn't all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last."
5.0,good price for a 64gb card. purchased it to go along with the Hero3 camera. Just what I needed to complete the set
5.0,Solid high speed cables delivered quickly.
5.0,"Some people complain about SD cards:1) Not working fast enough2) Some android devices are acting slow3) Rooted phones do not boot from SD cards.This card is fast about 28 MB/s, removed all the lag from Android device. HDR video recorder have no delays between video recordings (Which usually happens with most of the cards on the market) and all android rooted phones I tried booted and worked.I really recommend this card for price and performance!Good luck and enjoy you purchase."
5.0,"One of the benefits of having an Android phone is being able to have external storage. I popped this in my phone, moved my apps over, and added some FLAC, movies, and more.I added a selection of movies, and then never watched them. Then I was on a flight across the Atlantic and everyone fell asleep around me, and I remembered that I had added all these HD movies! That alone justified the purchase.Do yourself a favor and add some extra storage to your phone/whatever."
5.0,I use this in my Canon digital SLR.  Has lots of memory and the quality of images are great.  No disappointments.
5.0,"With the adapter I can easily use it in my camera, tablet, desktop P.C. & &#34;Smart&#34; T.V. &#34;Es muy bueno&#34; !"
5.0,good quality cable
5.0,"Works great, have this connected from my Thinkpad X1 Carbon OneLink Docking Station to an Asus 27&#34; LCD running at 2560x1440.  No issues, image quality is perfect."
5.0,Replaced another brand Class 10 32 GB micro SD card for my phone.  I didn't know how bad I had it before I put this in and started transferring files.  It was so much faster than my previous one. I am pleased.No issues with delivery or description.
5.0,I take lots of pics with my phone (Samsung 4S) and this helps free up space on my phone. I've not had any issues with it so far.
5.0,"Did the job!! Very nice would purchase again, and would recommend it as well."
5.0,"Very nice, lightweight case. Did not want a heavy case after buying the nice, lightweight Air 2 iPad. Like that it turns off the iPad just by closing the case. Also stands up nicely. Did think it on the pricey side, though."
5.0,great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon
5.0,"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend."
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,Works great with my Surface RT tablet.  Transfers to and from are very fast.  Great price for the size and speed.
5.0,Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane.
5.0,"We have 4 of the 32GB cards in our cell phones and love them.  They offer plenty of room for pix, music, and videos and are fast to save and load from..  Someday, when I get my desired tablet PC, I will be getting another one of these for it!"
5.0,"Do you need memory? This is 32GB of it in a MicroSDHC package. If that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like, then just get it and get on with your day. You've probably got better things, like that old episode of Gunsmoke you've been meaning to get to, or a nice walk along a cliff face. Possibly even something else. The point is that memory shopping shouldn't take you a long time. You should just do it. The amount of time it's taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase. Have a lovely mid-to-late-morning, whenever that might next occur in your vicinity. Cheers."
5.0,"I just received this device and put it through its paces. So far it's excellent! It is essentially the same shape as the Logitech MX 510 and Performance MX mice that I have used for years in a slightly smaller form factor. Even so, it fits my paw of a hand very comfortably. But the smaller size makes it easily stowed in a laptop bag. It uses one AA battery and a USB nano receiver which stores neatly and securely in the battery compartment when traveling. There is power button on the bottom for battery conservation when not in use. The scroll wheel is clicky, which I prefer, and there are side buttons for backward and forward paging in browsers.The sensitivity seems perfect to me but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Installation was trivial. Insert the battery, power on the mouse, insert the receiver,  and the drivers install automatically (Windows 10). It did not install any bloatware or additional crapware that must be manually disabled or uninstalled, as Logitech loves to do. Very clean and minimalistic.<br /><br />Time will tell if it stands up to moderate use or there are other warts. I worry that the battery cover compartment may be flimsy for repeated open/close to remove/store the receiver. However, so far this is flawless and the price is unbeatable. Exactly what I wanted. Recommended!"
5.0,I have a Samsung Note 8 tablet and by adding this 64 GB SD card it saved me quite a bit as I did not have to move to 32 GB internal disk - - Simply just slipped the 64 GB into SD slot and off we go.
5.0,"it's very fast micro sd card i use it for my mobile and gopro camera , sandisk is the best ever"
5.0,I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too.
5.0,best cast ever
5.0,I got this card to supplement the built in 32GB in my Galaxy Note 3.  This card provides superb internal xfer speed on the phone as well as to the PC using the Note 3's USB 3.0 port.
5.0,"Can't beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data."
5.0,Amazing how 64GB now fits on a micro card.  I added this to the ASUS Vivo Tablet to extend the memory and am very glad that I purchased it.  Working great and have always trusted ScanDisk!Great item......Great purchase!
5.0,Popped them In our Phones and they worked as expected.
5.0,Works great! Thank u! Great price too def be coming back!
5.0,Very happy with product
5.0,"Grate and fast memory, SanDisk is just top of the line."
5.0,"The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it's a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it's a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it!"
5.0,I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended
5.0,Great case! Would recommend.
5.0,"Simply works, what else matters?  Why does Amazon insist on a minimum number of words?  This is a simple product that works.  That' s all that needs saying."
5.0,"Twice the speed of the TWC WiFi and nearly twice the distance in reception. Remember to place it in a high location, in the middle of the house will work best. I run 2 AppleTVs I watch Netflix on 3 devices and best of all, I have the lowest tier internet speed. That's how good it is."
5.0,"This chip replaces my previously fried out offbrand microSD.  So far it has performed flawlessly.  If it fails, I will update the review.  I have a Droid RAZR M smartphone."
5.0,Thanks
5.0,This is a wonderful case
5.0,"I only use the Targus stylus.  I like the feel of it, the rubber tip glides smoothly and it has a title thing at the other end so I can clip my skinny lanyard type thing to it."
5.0,Works good!!
5.0,"So far so good, this card works fine in my LG Optimus L9. Its been about 5 days, and I've added 20gb's of music on it. I will update if this card fails me in the future."
5.0,"Good quality. I've been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one."
5.0,"Works as desired. Received On Time, Perfect Packaging, Flawless.<br /><br />Only thing to note for customers, If you are having troubles, Upgrade your bios. It worked for me after upgrading my bios. No Issue with the unit itself.<br /><br />My First Purchase at Amazon, Fully Satisfied."
5.0,"I picked this SD card to add some more memory to my phone. This works great and transfers data quickly. If you are in the market for a new SD card, I highly advise you to buy this one."
5.0,"Works great in my Samsung phone. Fast Enough to not really notice it is here.Came with an app that  shows disk usage both on card and internally, as well as Drop Box. Slightly useful.===Update: 1 year later it's become completely unreadable by any device. I was about to throw it out until I noticed that the warranty on this is pretty good. Contacted SanDisk, sent the old one back, and received a new card in a week. Bugs me that it stopped working -- it went from working to completely unfunctional in about 2 days. During that time the devices were complaining about corruption every couple of times."
5.0,"Bought this for my Nook HD and it works perfectly without any problems.  I already used about 80% capacity with HD movies, and my Nook HD plays them flawlessly.  Very happy with the product."
5.0,"Plugged this little gem into my 1520 and now have a huge amount of memory for video, kindle downloads, and music."
5.0,"Could not be happier.  It's fast, works great, and I didn't have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I've been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product."
5.0,"What can I say? This card just works. I'm honestly not a fan of Sandisk since their 64GB Ultra MicroSD died on me soon after my baby was born. I lost several weeks of photos, and I was quite angry.To be fair, they did send a new one after I sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half."
5.0,"// , Works."
5.0,"As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great."
5.0,I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great!
5.0,"only can use 29g after formatted butwhat can you do, i still like it for my psp, works great fast!"
5.0,"32 GB SD Card works well, and the price was reasonable, very happy with purchase so far! Worth a try!"
5.0,Used this in my GoPro camera.  Works great.
5.0,This little SD card is pretty amazing.  It is really fast and there was no issues when installing it.  It even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular SD card.
5.0,"Cloned a 350GB, 7200 RPM laptop hard drive to a 1TB Seagate Hybrid SSDHD in slightly less than an hour.<br />Ran the software right from the enclosed CD.<br />I was able to seamlessly swap the new hard drive for the old afterwards and the system fired right back up.<br />This was done to upgrade the hard drive for a Dell i7 laptop running Windows 8 with 8GB of RAM.<br />Simplest and quickest cloning product I have used thus far."
5.0,Purchased for school district.  I haven't heard any complaints (which I would) so I can only assume that everything is okay.
5.0,Product as described.  Fast Shipping
5.0,Works great! My son loves being able to set farther than 2 ft from the outlet.
5.0,Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones.
5.0,Great deal
5.0,"Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference."
5.0,"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints."
5.0,It takes a few tries to figure out how to fold it correctly to stand up but it has grown on me as a light weight easy to use cover. It weighs a lot less than my old book style cover and is not so clunky when I am reading in bed.
5.0,The sd card works perfectly. I use a samsung galaxy s3 lte and the sd was recognized without problems. I did not need to format sd. Just plug and play.Ups sent me the shippment in 3 days. I recommend the product and the provider.
5.0,I am using this item to extend the Memory Capacity on the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet. Very good price with free shipping(Order &#62;$35) and it works as advertised!
5.0,"This  micro SD is very fast, I use it in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and I don't have any problem regarding low speed."
5.0,"This arrived quickly and was the actual product that was described, unlike what others committed about this item.  It works and does just what I needed it for.  Thanks."
5.0,Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!!
5.0,works fine
5.0,"We always come straight to Amazon for our memory card needs, and SanDisk is one of the reliable names in this category.  Lots of usable memory for minimum cost outlay so there is no downside to this product. Max out storage on your compatible devices!"
5.0,"Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all."
5.0,"awesome, fits macbook air 13&#34; perfectly"
5.0,Perfect size for all of our portable paperwork.  We keep everything in it that we'd need if we had to leave the house quickly.  It carries it all.
5.0,"PROS.1.-Bigest memory in a microSD card (64 GB).2.-You have to FORMAT it with a modern device, if not you'll have only 32GB. If you format it with a modern device you'll have 60GB (the 64GB is impossible, or at leats I couldn't).3.-Even if your device says ""maximum microSd memory 32GB"", this memory 64 GB card can works. I tested on Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0, Galaxy SII and SIII, Galaxy Note II (phone), Galaxy Note 10.1 (Tablet) and on all Asus Transformer. It works fast and perfectly in all of them.CONS.1.- Just the price but you already have plenty of offers. I waited patiently and finally I bought it for $49.9 (incredible!)"
5.0,"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it"
5.0,"Buying two of the 32GB cards is even cheaper than buying one 64GB, too. It's a really is a solid value."
5.0,"with games being 1-2 gb now a days this card is great for storing all my high graphic games on my note 2 and with the extsd2intsd mod it all goes to my sd card, but thinks its my internal storage which is exactly what i needed."
5.0,"Great product, bought it for a mini oscilloscope"
5.0,Great network adapter. Does 5 GHZ speed and works on Windows10
5.0,I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.
5.0,Good transfer speed
5.0,"I am using sanDisk SD card for all my devices. Cellphone, Tablet and PC. What can I say, this product is one of the best!"
5.0,"I had been using a 'regular' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME."
5.0,"All I can say is that if you need a new SD card, dodn't hesitate to buy this one.  Great deal and it works perfectly."
5.0,I forgot I had I a SD card in my device. It's a seamless part without hesitation. Micros are hard to remove but that is a device flaw
5.0,"I purchased this product to install in my Garmin GPS unit, since it was full and couldn't handle the new map updates. Easily and securely installed, this memory card promises to provide a long life to my GPS unit."
5.0,exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro's.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS
5.0,its a good Book its working fine.
5.0,Made well. Like looks and style
5.0,Works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far. I also was able to purchase it here for much less then Wal-Mart.
5.0,Speed of processing the photo or video to be saved is good.
5.0,I love this Micro SD Card. I'm glad I bought it and I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I have never gotten any errors with it so far or failures.
5.0,"32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time."
5.0,"I like the cool sound it makes when your computer starts up.  This mouse has stood the test of time, nearly 4 years after I bought it, still works flawlessly.  I like the length of the cord and the fact that it's fabric wrapped makes it really tough yet flexible."
5.0,"I really like these SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards.  I have several and when I see huge price drops I pick them up for phones, cameras, GPS' as well as tablets, on which I store video files for traveling.  I've never had a problem with a SanDisk."
5.0,"Put in the lumix camera and it works fast and great, no complaints, never had any issues, highly recommended, this brand always comes through  ."
5.0,it was a gift for my mother in law and she said she loves it!! so win win
5.0,"Fast little memory card. Affordable, good quality. Will be quadrupling my storage space on my device. I never seem to have enough of these"
5.0,This item is what it is; I've been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems.
5.0,Great buy and cheaper than most stores. Fits my Galaxy S3 perfect for my music and photos. Fast speed and functionality.
5.0,Actually was better than I had expected.  Very functional.
5.0,"great card, haven't had one crash yet.  for $20 you can't go wrong with the 32 gb sandisk memory card."
5.0,"Yes they are ugly, but these are the best fans out there. Great static pressure fans for my case"
5.0,Great product with enough capacity and it delivers performance. I am happy with this product on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.
5.0,Gives me more time and memory when I'm riding with Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz and want to get some great footage
5.0,"I've never had a problem with Sandisk memory products (I use their &#34;ultra&#34; compact flash for my other camera), and this one is cut from the cloth. A great product with no problems... I will continue to demand Sandisk!"
5.0,Just what I needed for more storage on my phone. Don't know why but I've always bought the SanDisk brand and always been happy with the product. I have a few of these in varying sizes.Deb
5.0,"works great,no problems whatsoever.thanks."
5.0,"Good value for the money, shipping was a little longer than I expected, but it was worth the wait considering the price.  works great with my go pro hero 3 black edition."
5.0,Great product at a great price - working perfectly.
5.0,Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly.  Price was better than anything I could find in the stores locally.
5.0,"What is this thing? Oh, yeah. A memory card!It does what it says and nothing else.Keep remembering things even when you forget. Like my last girlfriend!"
5.0,great one i like it
5.0,"Perfect card.  I have it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and its fast.  no delay in pictures/video writing, and I think I may get a second just to keep on hand."
5.0,"Hard to believe that 10 years ago you would have needed a big hard drive to have this much room. I use this card in my Samsung Y Duos Smartphone and it provides more than enough room for my entire music library, a bunch of movies, and all of the apps for my phone and I still have more than 3/4 of the space left.Works perfectly and I've always had good luck with SanDisk products."
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT
5.0,I found this mouse very comfortable under my hand. This is what I was looking for at a good price..
5.0,The cards have had no reliability issues at their required tasks  so I did not put them under any data transfer time observations
5.0,Still works like a champ in my Pfsense box.
5.0,Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen.
5.0,"Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you'll like it!"
5.0,I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly.
5.0,"Love this case, this is my second on I purchased for my kiddos :)"
5.0,I've purchased 3 of the 32gb cards now. One each for my Galaxy S3 and my wife's. Also one for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The cards are super fast and there have been no problems. The one in my S3 has been in it since they came out last year no issues at all.I purchased a 16gb for our Roku2.You can't beat the quality and price.
5.0,great
5.0,Not all memory cards are the same.  Class 10 means faster transfers.  This one is even faster.  Works as promised.
5.0,Works great and is very fast.
5.0,"I have tried to copy out the files and it is an astonishingly 40MB/s  Not sure why others are getting such low speed read but it think it is the computer.  Mine is running Core i7, SSD and 16GB ram.  Probably it is why so.  Nevertheless, will see how durable is this microsd card."
5.0,"I always like to have reliable, high speed memory, and this is exactly what I needed for my smartphone."
5.0,"Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple!"
5.0,Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user!
5.0,in my Samsung note 2. fast no delays. transfers data in fon and to pc immediately. Good value for a top rated card.
5.0,"Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps."
5.0,when I got my phone I didn't know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it
5.0,Very nice product. The memory works perfectly and it is exactly what i was waiting for. I recommend it 100%
5.0,Easy to setup and install. Only concern is my past history with Netgear products which use Coax. They are very sensitive to power surges. Fingers crossed they've fixed that issue. Never once had a problem with Motorola/Arris modems.
5.0,"Came in very handy for the trip i was taking the week that I bought it. Nice size for travelling. I honestly need to sit down and read more about how to use it, but have not done that in the 3 months I've owned it because it was very easy to charge it up and start using it without any instruction. I do find that the charge runs down very fast, much faster than on my 4 year old IPAD. But I simply just plug it into the charger each night and have no problem. The price was great , $165 , no tax no shipping, and I see that it currently is down even from that low price."
5.0,What else to say about this Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SD XC ? just perfect as all Sandisk cards
5.0,"Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Fast and dependable, no problem with viewing videos from it on the Note 10.1.  Try it you will like it!"
5.0,"I bought this 64 GB unit for my new Samsung Galaxy S IV. I wanted the maximum size for music and the copious number of pictures i take of my kids and other things.I like the read and write speed on this card. I like the size but would have been happier with a bigger card but this is the max for my phone.Always happy with SanDisk, you will not be sorry you paid a little more.Edit: Should not have put ""they have never let me down"" in the title! 3 months in, I have been having problems with the SD card slot on my Galaxy S4. Not sure if it is the phone or the SD card moving in the slot. T-Mobile have sent me a new phone so we shall see.Edit 2: 4 Months in and I am having more problems with the same card. I received a new phone from T-Mobile and the same problem continues to occur. I have formatted the card twice and this gives a little time before the problem reoccurs. I have spoken to SanDisk and will call them again to have this card replaced. I will let you know how this goes."
5.0,"Good price, good quality. Put it in my phone for some extra storage, and it's held up very well since I got it."
5.0,"Can't comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I'll update."
5.0,These work great in a GoPro Hero 3+ Black.
5.0,Sh.. do yo hear that? No? Exactly! Great fan.
5.0,"Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn't have to worry about running out of space anymore."
5.0,"Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !..."
5.0,"I really dont have much to say about SanDisk's cards. They work as intended, I never had a problem with them."
5.0,This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd's and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks' are amazing. I've bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I've had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I've had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product.
5.0,good with low pricethankssandisk ulttra i used it for my dash cam. and its works. i can record unto 32g but as user i regularly formatting 1or 2 times amonths to keep memory in a good conditionthanks
5.0,This item stopped working about a week after I got it. Not the best product
5.0,I have bought two of these for both computers because they are easy to install and operate without a hitch!
5.0,"I was surprised to see the main drive in my Dell Venue Pro 8 was almost completely consumed by the Windows OS.  I added this card to create some space for myself.  The tablet recognized it as an additional disc with 29GB available.  That gives me plenty of breathing room for what I do with the tablet, and the speed is incredible.  I am very pleased with this product, and will purchase another one when I upgrade the card in my GoPro this summer."
5.0,Excelent
5.0,Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife's cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.  Not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal - extra features or not.
5.0,A coffee shop must
5.0,"Nothing bad to say, great product, great price. Works excellently in my video camera. One won't go wrong with this card."
5.0,Utilizing for my GOPRO Hero3 Black....no issues at all filming and transferring to my computer.  Good transfer rate and glad I got the 64GB for all the filming / photos done.
5.0,Got here fast and it worked
5.0,"I have no issues with this card. It works great and now I have a ton of storage space for music and what not. Bit overkill, but that's how I like it."
5.0,"I've only had it for about a week but so far I love it, it's small and I am able to put it on a lanyard or any keychain - this i exactly what I was looking for. For the price the amount of space it can hold is unbelievable, I recommend this product to all those looking for a cheap, small USB."
5.0,"Added space for movies, games, books, pictures, and music. Also great to relive the carrier's stock S4 for space. All major US carriers only supported the 16GB version of the S4"
5.0,Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I've always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone.
5.0,Love my Kindle.  It is so small and so easy to carry in my purse.  Holds a charge for days.  Highly recommend this item.
5.0,"This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don't think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it."
5.0,"Works great. Adapter makes it easy to load music, ebooks, pictures and movies onto card for use on a phone or tablet."
5.0,Data in and data out seems to be nice and fast. It was a quick ship. If I needed more I would order the SanDisk.
5.0,Used this card in my Galaxy S3 and have had no problems.  Tons-o-room for what ever you want and more.
5.0,Formated to FAT32 using Easy Partition Home Edition (free on the web) and it works on both my Samsung Galaxy S ii phone and Asus TF101 tabletAm gonna buy another one so each can have one
5.0,"Fast computer for my cnc, works great."
5.0,"This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Wonderful card and performs fast and efficient. I use it with my Samsung Galaxie S3 with no problems. Love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of SanDisk
5.0,works as advertised. Using this with Q10 which supports only 32gb. So far no issues. totally happy with the purchase.
5.0,Correctly priced. I bought it to use with my surface pro. Works great out of the box and transfer speeds are excellent.
5.0,doesn't seems to be some chinese crap... looks like it's the original one... works fine with my galaxy s4 and also with my tablet... 100% recommended...
5.0,Used this in my S4 and in my new S5. Transfer speed is good and it is still performing well after almost a year. I haven't been disappointed with a SanDisk product yet.
5.0,Great
5.0,"Works well with the tablet and htc phone, it doesn't need to do formatting. The devices recognized immediately with no problem. Recommended!"
5.0,"This is the card that solved the problem with three dash cams that would not operate properly, the problem was the cheap wrong type SD Card, use this card and it works!!!"
5.0,"I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don't need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn't work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format."
5.0,"Using this in a contout gps camera,  don't waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with."
5.0,"The read/write speeds are fantastic. Works great in my Galaxy Note 2. I absolutely love the space, it was worth every single penny."
5.0,Worked as promised.  Arrived overnight as required for scheduled presentation.
5.0,"As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK!? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos! I'd say, that if your phone accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer!"
5.0,I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items.
5.0,Fits my Galaxy SIII and gives me lots of storage :] Should be just the thing that I was looking for
5.0,"SanDisk is all I use. These are the backup microSDXCs for my two pro Canon cameras. They always work, never had one fail, and will store thousands of JPEGS on this card. I shoot in RAW on my CF card but simultaneously have a JPEG backup onto this card. I've never filled one even though I shoot thousands of photos on photo shoots."
5.0,The recent map update on my Garmin GPS ran it out of memory.  Maps are getting more and more detailed.  I used this to up the memory and got back to the Full North America Map. It cam with the adapter to fit my PC SD slot too.
5.0,I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last!
5.0,"So far so good. I use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly. No issue as of yet. Overall, I'm happy with this product."
5.0,"What can I say, So far it came in and works. Can't complain till it fails, so only time will tell..."
5.0,it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.
5.0,This memory card works in both my Nook and my Canon camera.  I chose this disk because it will hold lots of pictures.  It was shipped earlier than expected.
5.0,"Brilliant design and excellent value for money, perfect for the job - very pleased."
5.0,I have been looking for a 64GB memory card and I found one at our local electronics store but it was over $100.  I logged onto Amazon.com and found this at a great price.  Why pay more when you can come to Amazon and get it for less.
5.0,Love it fits perfectly.
5.0,"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]"
5.0,"I have rip music from SACD and DSD to put on this microSD and it can playback smoothly on FiioX3 Digital Audio player, no matter how big the file is."
5.0,I have a Vostro 1540 this is a perfect fit.  My old battery was dying which was causing overheating and random shutdowns (when the computer got to hot).  This new battery fix both of those issues.  The battery has the Dell logo and a made in china sticker much better then getting the same battery from Dell for 4 times the cost.
5.0,This product is perfect for what I needed it for. Providing a ton of memory in my Samsung Note 10.1 in a small package.
5.0,Love at a great $!!!
5.0,"This is an amazing memory chip card. At less than half the size of a regular postage stamp, this card fits my Garmin GPS and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing. AND, it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my PC with one of the many multi-card readers. 32 Gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended."
5.0,I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0,I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC.
5.0,"This is my second order of this exact battery. The first one lasted me for 2.5 years before swelling up, which is exactly what my genuine apple battery did after a couple of years anyway, so that seems to be an apple defect that we all have to live with.<br /><br />This works great, fits great and the color matches the aluminum on my macbook pro perfectly. And considering that apple doesn't manufacture these anymore, this is a GREAT investment. And i's under $30."
5.0,got for my Cell Phone and this card works nice and fast on my cell phone as well as on my pc to load it.
5.0,Easy to install and works perfectly.
5.0,Works great to store my pics and videos!
5.0,Great price for a great product works great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4 why anyone [pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me! Keep up the good work Amazon love you guys!!
5.0,"My hubby is now complete and very happy that he has ths for his Go Pro. Haven't tested it out yet, but we will soon."
5.0,"Works exactly as you would expect it to. Sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality, highly recommended."
5.0,"The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to."
5.0,Bought this to go with my Samsung Galaxy S III. It is class 10 which means it is fast. Works well.
5.0,"With the smaller electronics we finally are able to save on a card, it has an adapter so it will fit in the larger bays.  There is a lot of storage in such a small space.  I have been looking for the small cards to fit in my pad."
5.0,I shopped several other places for a good deal on a quality memory card and found it at amazon once again
5.0,My local electronics store had no inventory for memory in Micro-SDHC format. Amazon fixed that problem.This came in quickly and was a breeze to install. It saved me $15 - and that was an added bonus.Now I can download all my music to my cell phone.Problem solved.
5.0,love this item....would recommend
5.0,Use this charger everyday. Love it.  I need to look for a longer one.
5.0,Is there any more I can say? No! I get it less than 30 bucks! You can use it in your cellphone or whatever support it.
5.0,Use it every day.
5.0,"Easy to install, works perfectly."
5.0,"Plenty of extra storage can load a lot of movies in high definition, music and a boat load of other stuff."
5.0,Got here within a couple of days of ordering.  Easy to install and works great.  I wanted extra storage and this was right size for me.
5.0,"as described. took 3 weeks to arrive from china but its the real thing, same as picture. Speeds are good, 30mb/s read, 10mb/s write."
5.0,Perfect fit for my Ipad 1st generation.
5.0,Device works exactly as expected.  Holds a lot of music videos.  Would recomment to anyone.  Great product!  What else can I say!
5.0,I almost got myself a 16GB but decided on the 32GB last minute.  I'm so glad I did - I filled up my Hero3 White edition with over 20k time-lapse images and a few hours of HD footage.  These things are solid and reliable.  I filled it up over a 6 day period doing some work in Haiti.
5.0,Works perfectly. I can take the microSDHC from my Galaxy Player and use the adaptor to plug it into my iMac with no problem at all.
5.0,"I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another."
5.0,"boost the mp3 player size thanks, more more if you have the music or video's can not go wrong with more memory"
5.0,"Needed a cable to finish a video install in a hurry, fast shipping made it all come together great"
5.0,Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.
5.0,Got a Samsung Galaxy note 2 7.0 I'm gonna use for a CarPC and found that you could install a 64gb microSD. Tried this one and it worked flawlessly. Pretty zippy too for a tablet (ugh....tablets read/write is stupid slow but just good enough for media I suppose)Plugged this thing right in and used the tablet to format it. Got 60gb out of it. Good good.
5.0,I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.
5.0,The SanDisk memory card is awesome. I usually only buy SanDisk products because they are very reliable. Very good quality.
5.0,As to be expected this SanDisk works as advertised in my Garmin 850 GPS. I am satisfied with this product.
5.0,Lots of compliments on this case
5.0,Best case ever for a toddler
5.0,"So far so good. I've never noticed a difference in memory cards, I'm just very glad to have extra memory!"
5.0,Great replacement for my internal adapter that drops and doesn't even connect at times.
5.0,I use this memory card with my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Camera. I have had no issues recording 1080p video with this memory card. It provides sufficient write speeds. I bought the 16gb version. I wish I would have bought the 32gb version as 1080p videos become large files quite fast.
5.0,perfect
5.0,"The desk is great and works as advertised.<br />Suggestion for improvement: The edge of the legs should have a non-skid/non-slide surface. If you place the stand on a smooth table top, it keeps moving due to your pressure on the keyboard. The movement is very slow (the stand moves about an inch during 3-4 hours of working). A small rubbery sheath on the legs would make it much better."
5.0,Great little card. Will allow 1080p recording on my note 3 phone. Frustration free packaging is genius. Make sure your device supports the high capacity card before ordering.
5.0,This is the lowest priced 64 gb card I could find and it works great in my HERO go pro camera
5.0,"I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That's 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I'd throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I'd post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn't make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you're rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card."
5.0,"Great price for the chip, fastest speed on the market, and fast service good job. 16gb is a great amount of storage for the price, even better than 32 or 64gb, great for cameras, phones, tablets, etc."
5.0,Works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.Put the memory cards in and go to storage in the settings.  Click format card and off you go.I have not measured read or write speed but i can tell you i can copy over 1Gb video file in just a few seconds.
5.0,"great mouse, great price. I own this, as well as several friends and co-workers.  It's small, and performs perfectly. The small USB receiver is small enough that it can be left in all the time if you want."
5.0,Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues!
5.0,Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music.
5.0,"How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It's great."
5.0,"I haven't done much to speed test this device, but it does everything I ask it to and the price was right."
5.0,It arrived on time as schedule. It was purchased on black Friday sale so the price was much cheaper than current listing price. I am now regretting not going with the 64GB as recommended by my coworker.  I purchased it for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone.
5.0,"stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues."
5.0,excelent
5.0,"Worked out great, met all expectations"
5.0,Was exactly what my son wanted and was delivery very quickly! Very happy with the product!
5.0,"Love it, use it to store videos and photos on a Galaxy S3. Good stuff no problems yet like with my bootleg Transcend card."
5.0,Good value for product. I wanted 64 GB to put all my music on my phone.  Easily transferred from from hard disk to microSD via USB cable.
