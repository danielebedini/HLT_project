1.0,"Bought cables in 3ft, 6ft and 9ft.  NONE of them worked.  NO FUNCTIONALITY WHATSOEVER.  Tested many times, its as if the copper wires are just not connected to the terminations.  Do these even go through Quality Control before they leave the factory?  Waste of money and time."
1.0,"nope, cheap and slow"
1.0,"After exactly 45 days, the screen went dark. Power LED is lit & blue, my computer is able to detect the monitor but nothing on screen. Not even OSD. Tried different computers, different DVI/VGA cables, no dice.<br /><br />Had to reach out to the support, which advised me to send it in for repair to their Temple, Texas repair center. Have to pay one-way shipping and they may take 7-10 business days to do the repair (that's after they receive it). There is no other recourse but to be without a monitor for good 15-20 days (taking into account shipping time both ways).<br /><br />Should've just spent some extra money and bought a decent monitor to begin with."
1.0,IT HAS ALREADY CRACKED AT ONE OF THE CORNERS.
1.0,"Very disappointed the range of the router is very poor no more than 6mts, bought this to substitute the carrier default modem but the one of the carrier has more range."
1.0,"I have owned this router for less than 2 years (purchased in November 2013). The range and speed was acceptable, although, for the price I would have liked better. This would probably have been a 3 or 4 star review except, as of mid July, 2015, it has stopped working properly. One day, out of the blue, it no longer provided an internet connection. The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection. The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router. I have tried all the following in troubleshooting:<br />1: connected straight to the modem and had an internet connection.<br />2: Reset to factory settings and connected to default network but no internet.<br />3: Connected replacement router via same ethernet cable to the modem and it provided internet without issue.<br />4: checked router, power adapter, and Ethernet cable for any signs of damage (we have a cat) but none exist.<br /><br />So, As a result, I am rather upset that this product did not even last 2 years. I paid $135 for this thing new. It I had wanted a disposable product i would have spent 30 bucks on a cheap wireless N router and called it a day.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a fix or something for this issue, I will try it and gladly take this up to 3 or so stars but for the time being, I really believe it deserves one star."
1.0,I cannot get it to work
1.0,Totally wasted $60 on this battery.  Didn't work on my 17&#34; MBP (Mid-2009).  Went to Apple and had them replace it with their battery for an arm and a leg - but at least it worked.
1.0,"Terrible product. This device has absolutely no support, I was not able to even find any digitally signed drivers to work with this device. The only thing that I could get to work was the capture software, which seemed to work fine with my webcam. You get what you pay for, invest in a better capture device if you want any results."
1.0,"I own a photographic studio, bought this SSD to speed up my production time but it is really disappointing that after 10 months this thing is dead!!!!<br /><br />I went and turned on the computer and Windows started crashing, and couldn't access my files. I restarted the PC went it came back there was no boot disk....<br />Took the disk out and plugged in to a enclosure and test it on another computer but it wasn't recognized.<br /><br />Thankfully I keep back ups of my WIP orders because this caused me a delay in my work delivery schedule.<br /><br />For those who are considering this SSD please consider look somewhere else, for the money paid for this thing it should lasted a year minimum!!!!"
1.0,I didnt work in my computer. Either a compatability issue or faulty ram i couldnt say
1.0,"Bad fit for asus vivo tab, it is way bigger than the actual tablet. I ordered the right one as well because it says the right model type on the outside of packaging. Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,Works 30% of the time.  iPad stops charging with a &#34;Device not supported&#34; error.
1.0,Not the Xbox 360 power supply
1.0,No appreciable increase in signal strength
1.0,The item was defective. The bottom cover was too big and the shipping it back cost almost as much as the item itself. It was not worth returning. Won't buy from here again.
1.0,Doesn't work... Came all the way from china.. So I wont bother returning it
1.0,"I ordered the Right Angle cable, but received the Left Angle version. Yes, they are both 90-degrees, but one bends the opposite way. The bag was properly marked, &#34;Right Angle,&#34; but I received the &#34;Left Angle&#34; cable. I would say this is a StarTech (manufacturer) problem, but the bag is a zip lock style and was not permanently sealed, so it could have been switched afterward -- maybe a customer put it in the wrong bag and returned it to Amazon.<br /><br />The photo shows the one I got and the bag it came in. Notice the bag is marked Right Angle, but it is clearly the Left Angle version. I need the other one.<br /><br />Not sure what I'll get if I order Right Angle again... Maybe someone at Amazon or StarTech can grab another one, look at the cable in the bag, verify it's the correct one and send it."
1.0,"Horrible, never worked in any of my devices.  Kept being mounted and unmounted."
1.0,"I don't understand what this is for. I thought it was to protect the consumer against damage, like insurance. I wish the details were more clear. I still don't understand what it is, Lol"
1.0,Smells like burning. Buzzes loudly. Does not work. Please send me a replacement.
1.0,These are not MoCA 1.1    They will conflict with your internet.  Do not purchase unless you are using dedicated coax.
1.0,Complete junk.  Don't waste your money.  Very tiny and terrible quality.
1.0,JUNK!!!! THROUGH IT AGAINST THE WALL YEAR AFTER BUYING THIS JUNK....
1.0,I spent 2 hours conversing with Amazon.  This is the second 6 inch Kindle Fire I have returned.  I will never buy another or recommend a kindle.  I have never had this many problems Registering a Kindle.
1.0,The fabric the zipper is fastened to is very thin. It is actually the weakest spot on the whole cover. Within a year of light use there are several sports on this part of the case that have torn. Now the sipper hits these spots and will not close.<br /><br />This item did not last as long as I though it would. I would not recommend.
1.0,Did not work. No matter what phone we tried it did not work at all.
1.0,Lack of zipper on top of backpack makes me feel kind of scary of loosing things while travelling.
1.0,power adapter only 500mw
1.0,"I had to send this back to WD because of bad sectors, and the replacement they shipped me also had bad sectors."
1.0,Computer would not boot up.  It powered up but would not boot up.  Sent back and ordered another.  Hopefully the new one will work properly.
1.0,I loved this case ... until I realized that it traps the heat. This destroys laptops.  I recommend a cover with better ventilation for the processor.
1.0,This product is very unstable! it went off line from time to time. buy it at your own risk!
1.0,Product never worked. Tried several sets of batteries to be sure
1.0,Definitely not worth the money
1.0,Piece of garbage with zero in terms of documentation or instructions or any kind of direction whatsoever. This is the kind of product that not only turns people off of Amazon Prime but turns people off of buying anything technical that doesn't come with training wheels. Garbage.
1.0,Slow and poor quality.
1.0,DOES NOT cool laptop. Fans are moving but very little air is being put out. I bought this because it had a good rating. Makes one wonder about that now. Bad product!!!
1.0,This cord sucks! We have gone through 2 of them now.  They pull apart very easily when you unplug it from game console. Highly recommend spending more on the actual xbox brand cable.
1.0,very difficult to use.  Could not make it work and returned
1.0,Motherboard fried at 1 year & 28 days. I will not buy Dell anymore.
1.0,Can't connect to internet. Technical support not helpful.
1.0,This case might be OK if you take out the screen protector. Then again you could probably find a cheaper one that doesn't come with one. When I installed the case it made the screen protector bubble out in the middle. Not only did this affect the touch but also made the images distorted if you looked at screen from any angle other than straight on. Plus it really seems to show finger prints and has bad glare.
1.0,you say me that this battery was compattible with DV6 174la and  this is not compatible
1.0,DID NNNNNNNNNNNOT WORK
1.0,Item loses contact.  Connections are too loose.
1.0,"Ok so this rating is specifically the result of a policy in which Amazon restricts video for child accounts. You can't have AmazonPrime Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus and probably any streaming service. This is simply because Amazon wants prime members to also pay for FreeTime. Come on Amazon treat your customers right! You should change FreeTime to FreeLunch because all you want is Prime members to pay more and more and more.. If I want FreeTime I will pay for it..  BUT let me use the PrimeVideo that I already pay for SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!"
1.0,"Didn't fit,  too small."
1.0,"This is probably the cheapest thing I have ever bought off the internet. It is made so flimsy. For the price it should have been made a little more durable. It is absolute junk. When I placed my monitor on the stand, I was scared it would buckle from the weight."
1.0,didn't work
1.0,Wasn't sturdy and was opened and out of the package when I received it
1.0,"If you plan to use the iPad mini with headphones, do not purchase this. As several other reviewers state, the headphone jack cannot be accessed due to the thick protective edge around that area. There is a cut out for the headphones, but no standard jack would fit in the slot. We are returning this item."
1.0,"This is a poor case. The edges don't line up, the screws bend easily, and the case broke as I was assembling it. I would not recommend paying $10 for it."
1.0,"Table slipped out the holder, hit the floor and cracked. Not very secure at all."
1.0,"the spot where the charger goes in broke in less than 2 weeks.. I brought it for a 7 year old, so now it wont charge and she is disappointed and so am I"
1.0,Purchased this and it didn't work right to start with. Couldn't do much with it.... Didn't like the OS either.
1.0,Did not hold charge for long as days passed. Speakers not loud enough. Do not buy.
1.0,"The cable worked for about a month with my iPhone 5s. It no longer charges my phone. When I try to use the cable, my phone displays the &#34;This cable or accessory is not certified...&#34; message."
1.0,"This seemed like the perfect solution to be able to connect card reader and/or a USB stick, but sadly the SimulCharge [[ASIN:B00MOQFUQM LAVA SimulCharge USB 1-port Adapter for Samsung Galaxy Tab 4/S/PRO/Note - Model TL-002 (Micro USB OTG Host & Charge)]] won't allow the two to communicate. After several attempts with the SimulCharge it won't recognize anything :-("
1.0,Overheats in minutes. Lasted 3 days.
1.0,Did not power our phones well it took 3 hrs just to get a half of charge
1.0,This item didn't work for me I want to return
1.0,Didn't fit my 13&#34; MacBook Pro.
1.0,Broke down really quick :(not worth it :(
1.0,"Received wrong item, as far as I can tell. Package says B2-5094 VGA (M/M) which is accurate to what is in the package, just not what I ordered. The received items are for VGA connections, using 15 pins -- not 9 pins.<br />I am sure if I received the correct items I would be happy with them."
1.0,"My son had this drive for a few years and it crashed without any warning.  He lost all of his data of creative projects.  I contacted Lacie and they referred me to a data recovery service so I contacted Seagate Recovery Services.  They have a minimum fee of $500 to just receive and inspect the item.  Basically for your average customer this is a staggering sum and Lacie might as well told me we were out of luck. Nice looking design but, buy this product at your own risk."
1.0,"I must warn those of you considering this modem that it is very poor quality.  It runs very very hot.<br /><br />It worked perfectly for three months and then failed.  Granted, it is under warranty, but to determine it is broken, you have to pay for a service call that costs more than the modem.<br /><br />On the Comcast site it is ranked as a one star out of three based on its certification.  Buying it cost me a bundle in the long run."
1.0,WASTE OF MONEY THE END CAME  OFF 3 OF THEM IN 1 WEEK
1.0,This is a crap product. It simply does not work as advertised.
1.0,"Does not hold very much.  I was disappointed.  However, I will use it for &#34;something&#34; - just not sure what yet."
1.0,After 8 months it no longer works.  I would like another or a replacement.
1.0,"UPDATE: The &#34;spill-proof&#34; keyboard is not. I managed to slosh what amounted to a few table-spoons of coffee onto the keyboard. I promptly turned it upside down while pressing the power button to turn it off. I left it in a tented position for 24 hours after removing the batter, etc. all the usual things to make sure it was well ventilated. Result, about three months later: intermittent hard drive failures. Repair bill: $650. They want to replace pretty much everything inside, not just the keyboard: system board, chassis and fan assembly. So, what I saved by not buying directly from Lenovo and getting a break fix warranty (relying on the shock-proof solid state drive and &#34;spill proof&#34; keyboard) was money ill spent. It's a laptop. Things happen to laptops. You are better off buying it from Lenovo directly and getting a break/fix warranty, because if something stupid happens you will have saved zero dollars. (Not too pleased with Lenovo, either, although this is my third Lenovo, and escalating over teh &#34;spill proof&#34; keyboard issue).<br /><br />Camera doesn't work. Doesn't recognize USB devices reliably.  I think these are the ones that fell off the truck or something. &#34;Genuine&#34; in the sense that it looks like a computer from Lenovo.  OEM Genuine's answer to all issues is &#34;call Lenovo.&#34; If you want a Thank Pad, don't think you're getting a bargain here. Go to Lenovo and pay the full price."
1.0,2 of the 3 didn't work
1.0,Did not work
1.0,I purchased this for a 4k monitor the AMH 399U (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XTVGM7C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00) (a korean monitor). I knew going in that the cables that came with the monitor wouldn't work and that they would cause flickering and complete picture loss. I purchased this cable preemptively. Upon receipt of the monitor I plug in the cable into my Gigabyte 290X video card and the monitor and was greeted with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. This was the highest this cable could do stating that it had an communication issue. The default cables with the monitor work at the appropriate resolution but flickered as expected. I don't know if this is an issue with length in excess of 2 meters or not. I ended up getting an Accell UltraAV B142C-007B cable and it works perfect. Maybe try the 6Ft version and milage may be better. For 4K stay away from this cable.
1.0,"Disappointed... my first Kindle Fire 6 ended up with a cracked screen within weeks - Amazon could do nothing to help except tell me to buy a new one (no repair service offered). The second one I've purchased has a problem with the volume that I've had no luck fixing. When using the NetFlix app with headphones, the volume randomly drops to mute (the volume bar annoying stays on the screen) and won't allow it to be turned back up either through settings or the volume buttons. Hard reset is the only suggested fix and it just does the same thing once started up again. Very disappointed."
1.0,"prefer Kindle, Edition 2 - no printed instructions included- doesn't give clear menu"
1.0,Product worked for a few days then failed had to retirn it...
1.0,Single worse product I have ever ordered.  I ordered 4 and each of them failed in the same way and failed immediately.  They are junk and the screws do not hold and they do not stay in the cheap plastic.  This is not effective as a security device nor can it even hold a tablet on the wall.  This would be an awful April fools joke to play on someone.
1.0,It's not even the original charger. Totally different than the posted picture. It's not original
1.0,It did not fit.  I guess that's what you get for $12.00.  I had to go buy one from the store.
1.0,"The matte finish shows every fingerprint, and cannot be wiped clean. The edges are peeling already.<br />The clip-on sections of plastic have been breaking off since I got it. The bottom half of the cover won't stay on now.<br />But, I can say that the keyboard cover looks classy and doesn't slow down my typing. So there's that."
1.0,"Don't buy this laptop, it's good at first but after 3 days of having it problems started popping up. First connection kept getting disconnected and 2days after that, the &#34;BSOD&#34; Driver Power State Failure kept happening every 30 minutes. I'm just here to help you save your time and money."
1.0,Does not fit. Beware before buying.
1.0,"I purchased this to share some files among employees but the server was soooooo slow and useless.  I called WD tech support - they were very helpful with good support, but the product itself was just not to the standard.  It even failed or took forever to upload 10MB, 20MB, 30MB files. Downloading files off of this drive was very time consuming as well. Over the cloud is out of the question.  Since it doesn't have USB connector, the quickest way was directly plugging into your computer's Ethernet port and access using network connection, but for some reason, not like regular USB external HDs, even this direct Network connection failed or too slow,  After many hours spent getting all data off from this HD to my other regular USB external HD, I retired this product and not going to use it again..  Very disappointed."
1.0,"Worked fine on the 15V setting for about 3 weeks. Then one day it had no output, checked with meter and output was dead. No abuse, and never run hard, it's just unreliable. Advise against purchasing this item."
1.0,This mouse has hardware problems that make it difficult to use for gaming.
1.0,"It's a beautiful however, the top case is very difficult to remove and the corners have already broken off on my case. I've only had it for a week and it is already falling apart. Will most likely use it for now and buy a better replacement that is more sturdy."
1.0,Never got to use it. Install CD did not work
1.0,Product was delivered with an operating system that could not be activated.  After 3 hours on hold with Lenovo and Microsoft I am advised to return it.  My fervent advice to anyone shopping on Amazon is NEVER to buy an electronic equipment online.
1.0,"Dyed my two Uppercase Thermalplastic Polyurethene keyboard skins a red/purple color that won't come off. When I noticed the skins turning red, I washed the cloths with water and noticed a lot of red/purple dye in the rinse water. Luckily no damage to my computers. No longer using the product."
1.0,WAS NOT ANY GOOD!
1.0,doesn't hold much of a charge....hate it
1.0,Buy a more expensive one. Or should I say a better quality one.
1.0,"Broke after a month of use, cheap and not good, save your money"
1.0,"Seemed to have a faulty drive when arrived, as I was given a variety of errors upon multiple start up attempts. Returned for a full refund."
1.0,Got this item and broke the next day. The usb piece went into my laptop and when I pulled it out half of it was stuck to my computer.<br /><br />Crappy item
1.0,They don't fit the screen.
1.0,Doesn't work and broke after one day
1.0,"This is probably the best stick you can get around the price, really you wont be getting one that will perform this well until you put down another $50 or so, but I have had mine for about 3 months and it is broken. Believe me its not like I threw it at the wall or anything, one day it just stopped taking any inputs from moving the stick around. All of the buttons still work from what I can tell but it is completely unusable because of some disconnected wire somewhere.<br /><br />Honestly its not a bad stick, but some other reviews I have seen also show that they have a tendency to break because most of it is make of cheap plastic. You get what you pay for."
1.0,"For the google nexus 7,  or the silver keyboard, it is shown with the connection button and the on and off switch on top. the one I received was the one shown for blue or black mini, where the switches are on the side. The attachment or slot for the tablet is badly made, as it was screwed together. Your tablet pushes against the front and back when opening or closing, and seems to dislodge itself from its position. The tablet falls out of the clasps if having been thrown in a bag. Shipping was something else, it seemed as if the box was thrown then shipped without care as the keyboard itself was falling out of its plastic holder when received. The letters seem to be stickered on.<br /><br />The keyboard itself is responsive, and has multiple extra keys."
1.0,"Within a week, the rubber ear pieces came off and there is NO way to attach them back on.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"I should have believed the other bad reviews on this switch.<br />After being used less than 15 times in the first 6 weeks, it quit working.<br />Sadly, this happened after Amazon's 30 day return policy so we're stuck with it.<br />Luckily it's a cheaply priced Made In China item.<br />Sadly, most things Made in China are cheap and poorly made."
1.0,"Ordered it 3 months ago. Have had to replace the batteries twice and there seems to be a short, will not work, have to shake to get the mouse to work. Poor quality, very disappointed."
1.0,Had to exchange because the battery stopped charging fully. Now. the replacement only only charges 80%
1.0,"Shy of two years old, this device's battery barely holds a charge. Very disappointing for such an expensive tablet."
1.0,it is very hard to used it
1.0,This has never worked right and now I have been told we have a pirated version of windows 7
1.0,Arrived DOA.  Had to pay return shipping to get my money back.
1.0,"I've had these for less than a week and even though they are in great shape, the left speaker is now useless and not working. Its pretty upsetting considering i have a razer keyboard and bought this to replace my old razer headset which lasted me years. So ill be thinking about getting a different one and not this particular model."
1.0,Falls apart rather quickly.  Felt bad for my kid as this was her only charger. Took a few days to break.
1.0,"Defective product, didn't work with W540 laptop.  Didn't fit flush, which isn't a problem, it just failed to function.<br /><br />Probably a defective unit. Returned it and am going to buy a different one which actually works and fits flush and looks better (the fake panel on the side says all kinds of dumb garbage.)"
1.0,"I purchased this battery for the exclusive purpose of charging my bluetooth headphones when I am on the go, but due to what I suspect is a design flaw, it cannot charge them at all, so these are really useless for me. Let me elaborate on what I think the problem is.<br /><br />The charger itself have no buttons. To view its current battery level, you have to plug in a cable to either of the slots, and its battery level indicator will light up for a few seconds, and then switch off. If I plug in another device on the other end, e.g., an iPad, the battery indicator will be kept on, and the iPad will get charged until this battery pack runs out of juice. However, when I plug in my headphones (I've tried a [[ASIN:B00TSTVJ86 SoundBot SB553 Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Earbud Stereo Earphone Headset w/ Ultra Light Weight, In-Line Control, Built-in Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Battery, Multi-Point Connectivity Technology, 100hrs Stand by Time, 5hrs Talk Time, 33feet Wireless Range, Built-in Mic, Tangle-Resistant Flat Cable, & Crystal Clear Sound Technology for Music Streaming and HandsFree Talking for Android, Apple, iPhone 6, 6 Plus, iPad, Smartphone, Tablets, PC, Video, Laptops and More]] and a [[ASIN:B00STP86HC Soundpeats Qy7 Mini Lightweight Wireless Stereo Sports/running & Gym/exercise Bluetooth Earbuds Headphones Headsets W/microphone for Iphone 5s 5c 4s 4, Ipad 2 3 4 New Ipad, Ipod, Android, Samsung Galaxy, Smart Phones Bluetooth Devices (black/blue)]], the battery indicator will go off after a few seconds, as if nothing has been plugged in. I believe this is due to the low current draw from these devices. The charger doesn't think anything has been plugged in so it switches off. I have other chargers and they all charge these headphones, so this is a unique problem with this charger. If they had implemented a button like most other chargers to allow users to check battery level, then they didn't have to put in this kind of power off logic. Very disappointing.<br /><br />Check the attached photos to see how the headphones get charged for only a few seconds. Everything lights up and then after a few seconds? It's dark."
1.0,It stopped working a month after I started using it. It has an error message saying &#34;SD card unexpectedly removed.&#34;  I spent a week and a half trying to fix it myself. I've searched google looking for solutions. There is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It was working perfectly fine until the error. Unfortunately my window for an exchange had closed right before it stopped working. Money wasted!
1.0,Did not like it. Very weak signal
1.0,"Worked for 2 days and then the center of the phone plug turned black like it burned itself up.  Also, according to my Apple dealer who tested it, this was NOT an &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; item despite the headlines saying such."
1.0,Didn't work for my laptop
1.0,This is a horrible laptop do not recommended I got it and I've had problems with it since day one not satisfied not worth the price😠😠😠
1.0,"Cheaply Made product!  The board is poorly soldiered; after continual use of about two weeks, the fan controller shorted out.  The only way to power the fans is to rest something on the USB cord that give constant pressure to the PCB board."
1.0,"I was impressed with the Kindle Fire the first couple of months but then it slowly became a pain in the butt to operate. I would turn it off and then try and turn it on and it wouldn't respond at all in any sort of way. I would have to wait fifteen minutes just to get a response.  I would be watching a Video and then shut it off to do some work and then go back and the video won't respond and if it does it would play the video with a black screen with just the sound playing and I would have to hold down the off button just to reset it.  If I was going to buy another Kindle I just wouldn't because I don't think its a very good Tablet in any sort of way.    Update - Now the on/off button doesn't work unless I plug it in and I have no clue why this is happening now, this just cements my feelings of thinking that Kindle Fire is the most useless tablet on the market. I was very impressed at first but then as time goes on the tablet just gets worse and worse."
1.0,Nothing but junk doesn't even work .  But why bother to send back for what I paid for it
1.0,Got it installed in the computer in early May it is now Aug and the power supply blew. I was told to return it as it may be under warranty... it does not appear to have a warranty so now I am out of luck till I order a new power supply. I'm not happy at all as I use my computer to work from home.
1.0,Returned. Useless.
1.0,Do not work
1.0,mine has already stopped working in less than 6 months.
1.0,"I almost forgot about this order, found it accidentally when searching my Amazon purchases, but I still remember the bitter lesson I learned - not to buy second hand computers anymore.<br />The computer I received turned out defective and very dirty, somehow I negotiated a replacement, which worked for just 3 months. The price I paid to Apple to fix was $1100.00:  they found the display was replaced with some third party display, the logic board was messed up, the upper case, the keyboard, the HDD, one ribbon cable, the super drive was not functional...just a computer piled from random parts. I paid the price and later I fixed more things to this computer, for instance Apple's labor turned out not perfect too, they did not assemble properly the new display which I fixed later myself.<br />This computer still works and I gave it two years ago to a friend who can not afford to get a new one.<br />At least I learned how to diagnose and fix macs."
1.0,"Very unhappy with product quality. Extremely cheap item. By the time I would pay return shipping though, I would only have $1 of my money refunded. Awful!"
1.0,This gets hot and is a knock off of Apple.
1.0,"Broke not even a year later, wouldn't buy from this seller again. Just purchase right from Apple"
1.0,"We bought about 5 of these after the first one. Worked great for the first month, then they all failed one after another. All of them now have the exact same problem - the connectors do not quite seat properly, and you have to slightly torsion the cable to charge. It's annoying because A.) you since you have to have some kind of pressure applied to the cord, you cannot use the device while charging, and B.) you have to position the phone just right for it to charge. Would not recommend - spend $5 more and buy a higher quality product."
1.0,Skips all over and can't control mouse-Returned
1.0,Does not fit Samsung note 10.1 but clearly says it does?
1.0,its just brock after 2 days of use .. how is this
1.0,Said it would fit an old Compaq laptop I had. It didn't.
1.0,Battery came on schedule.<br />Popped the battery into the laptop. Battery  arrived with 65% charge so it only took about an hour until it was 100%. It appears battery will hold charge for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour with laptop surfing Google News. I'd suggest this battery weighs less than half of what the original battery did and holds a charge for less than a third of the time.
1.0,"I've never seen so many fake 5 star reviews before. This cable cannot make your picture sharper, they're all lies."
1.0,Product does not fit well in iPad. It feel out a few times. Do not recommend.
1.0,"I haven't used the product because when I unpackaged it, it had a definite green cast to it and I didn't want to screw my viewing of colors on my screen."
1.0,2 Days later it broke
1.0,cheap.  Get what you pay for.
1.0,"Showed up under search for &#34;portable blu-ray player&#34;  but is actually a blu-ray disc/recording device.  Had purchased this for grandchild to watch movies in the car, but there is no screen and it is not portable - must be plugged into a PC.  I have returned it."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on this! I have had nothing but problems with this laptop! It freezes up, it shuts down and takes away all my desktop setting randomly (the background picture and custom color) I have to manually clear the cache every few weeks or the internet is so slow that it takes a while to even type something out! Speaking of internet... the only browser it will run properly is Explorer. It barely functions after running Netflix or Photoshop even if you exit out of them... and I find the touchscreen pointless. That is a feature I just don't use.<br /><br />Buy a different laptop, because this one is not worth the money! I would give it a zero rating if I could."
1.0,"It doesn't work.  The claim that it doesn't need to be powered or active is a lie, because of voltage differences between the two standards.<br /><br />I tried using it with a brand new HP PS/2 keyboard (that I also ordered off of Amazon) and it did not work with it.  That same keyboard works fine plugging it directly into any of several machines I have with native PS/2 ports.<br /><br />I also tried using it with an IBM keyboard from around the year 2000 -- and it didn't work, either.  That keyboard does work, again, on a machine with a real PS/2 port."
1.0,"Update 03/04/16: Nothing like bad customer service to ruin what should have been great product. If you are going to run hard tubing with this or any other combination of the AX series be ready to exchange rads several times before finding one without defect because if you wait longer than the return policy here on Amazon allows XSPC support will claim that their bad QC is an industry standard and that it not qualify this radiator for an RMA. The issue here is that the built in ports on this and my AX360 rads are in a angle. Why would that be a problem you ask? Well good luck running a straight run out of it into something else. It looks awkward and sometimes just plain not safe since you will be putting a strain on the tubing due to the angle of both fittings not matching. This should be grounds for a RMA but XSPC just plainly told me that it was not and it is quite common defect on rads... Yeah lost all my faith in this guys after that and for now on will move on to another brand. And will always thoroughly check the goods for minor junk like this that can go highly undetected.  My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on aesthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I don't care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recommend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture."
1.0,"I finally received it, had no idea it had to be shipped from China, it doesn't work. Will not charge my nook. Very unhappy. Zero stars"
1.0,"It does not work for my Mac Book Pro.  The plug is too small.  I bought this as a backup to the power cord that came with the new laptop and I just discovered that the plug was not compatible today, but I cannot return it due to Amazon policy.  I feel cheated as this was suppose to be compatible with my new Apple laptop and it is definitely not.  Buyer beware!"
1.0,Failed. DOA. Still haven't gotten the refund.
1.0,It never worked. Not eligible for return.
1.0,"I was given these as a gift and am yet to get them to work. The box come with no instructions other than what is printed on the outside which amounts to &#34;plug and play.&#34; Well I tried that and they didn't work. There's absolutely not customer service to speak of (couldn't even find a phone number online let alone with the product packaging) and resorted to going to online forums to search for people with similar issues. Still without a solution, I hope some representative reads this and tries to get in contact with me. I would love to to judge these speakers on their quality and not just their inability to work."
1.0,"What a piece of junk. Bought one, updated firmware--it prompts you to do it--uuuuuunnnnnngggggggg.....lights are on, nobody's home. Can't access the router itself. Nothing but a warm brick. Sent it back, they overnighted another (yay amazon!). Downloaded updated firmware, and...uuuuunnnnggggg.....this one looks like everything works, except you can't connect wirelessly. Allows  you to change the SSID and passwords, pretends all is well--psych!--no connecto no matter whatto. Sent it back for refund. What a waste of time."
1.0,"The case was too small, therefore my computer could not fit in it."
1.0,The battery stop charging in less then a month time of my purchase
1.0,Piece broken off after a few weeks use.
1.0,"Awful piece of junk.<br />Trackpad is by far the worst I ever used - sometimes it works, sometimes not. You just cannot get used to it, cause it seems to require different approach every time you use it.<br />OS is awful - even more so than usual from M$ - it took me half an hour to delete a network connection with all the extraneous windows popping up at inconvenient moments (I guess compliments of crappy trackpad) due to incorrect password - and I've been using PCs since MSDOS days and administer a network of PCs (thank God I didn't update them to W8) and MACs.<br />Screen is small and barely readable.<br />Impossible to do any stuff on. Wish could return it but it was a present so we are past return window. Simply waste of money."
1.0,"I purchase it on July 26/2015, as soon as I connect to my computer it got installed, follow all the instruction, mess with it for over an hour and finally gave up, couldn't make it work, today is Aug 30/2015, try to return it, but expiration date to return was Aug27, not happy with the product, instruction on the box can miss lead you easily, I'll be careful next time ordering anything from Amazon! not happy at all"
1.0,"Have had this drive approximately 6 months. Worked great right up until died a few days ago. Had hoped I wasnt making a mistake by switching to an ssd with less space and more cost. Maybe it was just the brand , I don't  know but thought others should know."
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  This mouse is always freezing up.  It has a mind of its own.  I spend more time trying to get the mouse to unfreeze than I do getting any work done!  I wound up throwing the mouse against the wall because I was so frustrated.  Once again, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1.0,Was not told refurbished til lgot box it is slow and buttons font work well and programs that ce installed are slow. U can definitely tell. Would not do that again
1.0,"The Drive reported issues (through SMART) less than one week of using the drive in a RAID. I did buy 4 of them and the other 3 are ok. The low rating is for their support (lack of). I CANNOT find any way to talk to someone. I buy Hard drives ALL the time. Usually from other venders. I tried Toshiba because of price, But IT IS NOT WORTH IT! I will NOT buy any more drives from them.  UPDATE: WHY CANT I give 0 stars!!! Not worth typing the ordeal here, im exhausted from trying to a very simple thing done....   Just Buy WD Drives.  I had NO idea that HardDrive companies in this age could have such different Quality support."
1.0,Was dead on arrival and would not charge
1.0,"The Dell Neoprene sleeves looks nice at first but when held against other Neoprene sleeves on the market it comes out pretty lacking. The cost difference with this Neoprene sleeve and others seems directly correlated to how thin this is. It may look nice in the photos but that is all there is too it. It is essentially all flash and little to no substance. The padding is extremely thin which made me feel a bit nervous slipping my Dell 2-1 laptop into this before putting it in my bag. It seems to be able to resist scratches and such but I would much rather had more padding for more protection. I would definitely avoid getting this sleeve due to how thin it is. If I had to use some unit to say how thin it is, it is essentially the thinnest sleeve zip up binder type of covering out there, you know the offbrand ones that arent from Mead Five Star etc."
1.0,"This product is horrible. I can't believe it's on Amazon Prime. Not just that the ear pads keep falling and are impossible to return, they also publish it a headsets for kids, which in no way it is."
1.0,Does not charge
1.0,"As others have noted, there are several drawbacks:<br />1. Inability to assign static IP addresses without the device first having made a connection with the router.<br />2. A wait of 20-80 seconds for a save and reboot each time I make a change on the router. What a frustrating exercise in futility!<br />3. Attempting to save a simple port forward saving forces router to reboot, and without saving the rule.<br />4. Mine has consistently dropped the Internet connection and is in some sort of reboot loop at the moment after attempting to save a port forward rule. Not cool!<br /><br />If I can get it to reset properly, I'll try DD-WRT on it to see if that helps. Otherwise, this will be an Amazon return."
1.0,Recieved a MiniUSB adapter instead of a MicroUSB adapter. Wrong item in packages.
1.0,No piece to connect to computer included. It is just a paper weight.
1.0,Did not like the product.  More like a purse that a Kindle case.  To large.  Will give to goodwill and not keep.  Misleading picture.
1.0,"So far complete crap ... I wanted to replace my five year old Xoom because it was starting to slow down. Alas, this piece of garbage seems to run at about the same snail pace. Takes all eternity to load an app, then freezes. I can't even get any of the GPS apps to work on it, it just keep continuously downloading some random crap and slowing everything down. What a joke of a tablet...  update: the battery time on this thing is atrocious too ... my Xoom could last an entire week of random browsing and occasional game play and charged super fast. This thing takes all eternity to charge, then after a day of web surfing it's already half way dead ..."
1.0,Did not fit laptop properly.
1.0,"after a few days it had trouble pairing. Once we got it to pair, only 3 keys worked. this was after about 3 days of moderate use"
1.0,"December 2014 Anker bought a Bluetooth keyboard. After eight months using Six Number button, then use this failure is impossible."
1.0,Had to send this screen back. It has a 40-pin connector. My Dell E6540 has a 30-pin connector.
1.0,It's ok. Prefer the  HooToo 7 Port as it's a little cheaper and does the same thing. - Updated the review it died less than a year in service.
1.0,"I don't like it. I can't use it because the throttles won't calibrate. Mad Kats/Saitek provided no support, so it's back in the box gathering dust. Even if it had worked, I liked the layout of the X52 Pro much better. So, even though the trigger no longer works after 11 years of flawless use, I'm back on the X52, and I can buy a new one locally."
1.0,"Worked great for the first month. Afterwards product refused to turn on. Yes,I did try replacing the batteries. Never ordering 'tecknet' products again."
1.0,I can't get it to work properly. I spend way too much time trying to figure out how to get it to work
1.0,"So, it didn't seem to work with the Surface Pro 3 as advertised.  I made sure to isolate the variables, and everything works great without the hub.<br /><br />Oh, it does come with a dp mini to dp adapter, which works great!  It also shipped quickly.<br /><br />So my first instinct was to look through the documentation and make sure I set it up correctly.  I verified that, despite very minimal documentation, even online.  My next instinct was to call a support number - there was none.  Email address?  None listed.  On the website there's a web forum you can sign up on to request support.  This forum has requests for help that usually get responses after a couple days.  It doesn't seem very customer friendly, and my device doesn't work.  There were a few different people who had issues about spotty experiences using the Surface Pro 3 and the Club3d hub.<br /><br />I'll be using a usb3-to-displayport adapter to meet my needs.<br /><br />Needless to say, as it does not seem to work as advertised, and support is minimal, I will be returning it."
1.0,Did not fit my Samsung galaxy tab 8.4 not happy.😠
1.0,Inexpensive but not recommended; connector to hook to charging cable is very fragile.
1.0,Cells dead after less than two month.
1.0,"This started off as a great purchase, until it wasn't. Before this router we had an old linksys which, while it worked well, did not provide us with the speed and range that we wanted. One day while perusing amazon for alternatives I stumbled onto this one. Oh how happy I was to have something that offered the ability to stream Netflix without issue and allowed my son to use the Xbox without lag. After setting it up with a unique username and password and connecting our myriad devices to our new wifi we were off... That is until the day I tried to log into my wifi settings and happened upon someone else's router settings. Imagine my surprise when I logged into the settings to find none of my own devices, no gaming systems, smart phone or laptops, but rather those belonging to someone else. I touched nothing in the way of settings and logged out and once again tried to log into my settings. Nothing. No interface, not even a login window. I tried to reset the router to factory settings and after it power cycled it was if nothing had happened, all the settings that should have been wiped out were still there. My phone connected, along with the rest of the wifi devices that litter my house, yet I still couldn't log into my router settings.<br /><br />It was at that point that I called the Asus component help line. I phone number that, while offering that ability to speak with someone, offered little in the way of any help. After an hour on the phone with some man who spent more time yelling and interrupting me then offering assistance, I hung up vowing never again to call that number. That was months ago... and while I have been monitoring my network to ensure that no one was making unauthorized use of my internet with a 3rd party program, it was bothersome that I could not access my network settings.<br /><br />My plan to never again contact the Asus help line was working well, up to today when I realized that I needed to connect a new network camera to our home network, and hoping that last time was a fluke I decided to chance another call. This time around the experience was better...to begin with. The helpful gentleman was quick to assess my problem, a non-functioning reset button. He assured me that everything would be taken care of and that I would be receiving a new router shortly, stating that he only needed to place me on a brief hold to finish processing the RMA.<br /><br />After a few short minutes Lee, that was his name, joined my back on the phone saying that unfortunately to process the RMA I would first need to ship my current router back, and that it would take anywhere from a week or two to receive my new, hopefully functional router. It seems ridiculous that in a world in which the internet is now required for school (both my wife and sons respective schools require them to have internet access to turn in homework assignments and papers) and work that the removing ones ability to access the internet is something that a company deems acceptable. I voiced my concern to Lee, who to his credit did his best to see that my concerns were mollified, and he transferred me to someone claiming to be a specialist. When I explained to her that it is impossible for my household to make due without access to school websites since my wife's college classes make use of online exams and my son's school requires homework to be done on an iPad and submitted electronically (an issue for another time) she told me that while there has been an outcry for an advanced refunding process for routers, Asus would be unable to assist me in my request, I was flabbergasted. It seems absurd to me that a company, any company, would be deaf to the request of there clientele, and more so when that company is located in the tech sector with global reach (what would they do without internet for a week? I realize that the comparison is one of a hyperbolic nature, but the point remains in a world were many make their living in a home office a week or two without access to the internet could have a devastating effect on there income). I was informed that while their motherboard department was afforded the luxury of sending working replacements before receiving the defective product, that an arbitrary line in the sand had been drawn and on this side there was nothing to be done.<br /><br />I was appalled. After having spend a small fortune on various Asus products over the past five to ten years on products that range from monitors to motherboards I was offered little more then a cold shoulder. I have had various other problems with other hardware purchased for computers; some faulty hard drives, ram and motherboards from other companies, and in every other situation the RMA has been handled after working replacements have arrived at my door step. The customer service I was provided was anything but customer orientated. Since I now need a new router, it looks like I will be looking at Asus's competitors for both my immediate and future hardware needs.et could have a devastating effect on there income).

1.0,"Purchased two of these. Both died prematurely at a very early age (2 months).<br />Moved air wonderfully and quietly, but short lifespan precludes a third try."
1.0,Pretty cheezy product.  Not that impressed with it.  Used it for about 3 days until it broke.
1.0,"These do not allow for a 'quick charge', taking 3 hours to charge the S6 with quick charger.  Using other cables and non quick charge adapter, it still charged quicker than these cables allow."
1.0,the video hole was off centered.

1.0,"Horrible product. A month later, it stopped working. Reached out to seller and was told that it wasn't their problem, basically, and to contact Amazon customer service. Do not buy. Waste of money, especially when you're battery is on it's last leg. Look elsewhere."
1.0,"I bought this laptop for college. The laptop works fine. It runs everything I need it to run for school. However, after 2 years of careful use, the laptop literally began to fall apart. Funny thing about Acer is that they have a LIMITED 1 YEAR WARRANTY for their products. This obviously is a manufacturing issue, but they were no assistance to me. I contacted Acer and they directed me to their 3rd party assistance and the man on the phone told me to &#34;go to staples. They can help you fix it.&#34; IF I WANTED TO GO TO STAPLES I WOULD HAVE CALLED STAPLES! I called Acer to get assistance from Acer. The man also told me that since my laptop is no longer under warranty, that in my attempts to call Acer, they would not help me. There was no way I would ever be able to contact a REAL person. Therefore, I am writing this review very upset that I WASTED money on a laptop that may not make it through my undergrad career. Acer was no help at all. Save yourself the trouble and buy a Dell, a Mac, Toshiba, Sony, ANYTHING BUT AN ACER."
1.0,Keyboard is decent. Feels mechanical the feet on the bottom of mine broke off. and also the keys get dirty easily and are hard to clean.<br />Mouse is total trash. Gets dirty easily. Scroll wheel squeaks. Mouse sometimes when im playing a game like csgo it sometimes glitches and moves around by its self.
1.0,return not the color I wanted.
1.0,Cheap and was missing keys. Very disappointed.
1.0,Didn't worked
1.0,"Quit working after a couple months, then the short one quit working after a week."
1.0,"It didn't work. I installed the battery and allowed it to charge. When I went to boot up my computer, it would run for 15-20 seconds then turn off. I sent it back. When I was looking for another battery, many of them looked identical to this one. I chose one that wasn't identical and had a slightly lower Wh rating."
1.0,Worse reception than my Belkin n100 router I had. Returned it. Good interface but poor range
1.0,Mouse wouldn't even work with this mouse pad.
1.0,"I wanted to like this case as I like using the Kickstand on my Surface Pro 3 and this case is compatible with it. That's where the pros end. What I don't like about this case is I feel it really cheapens our premium devices. In my opinion, the bottom is too soft and flexible it doesn't inspire any confidence in the ability of it to protect my Surface. The build quality is questionable as I could see slight imperfections in the rubber around the vents left over from manufacturing. However, the biggest drawback is I cannot remove the keyboard with the case on the device. To remove the keyboard, I must remove the case, take off keyboard, put case back on to use it like a tablet. The purpose of the magnetic keyboard from Microsoft is to quickly attach / remove it from the device. This prevents that, therefore I cannot recommend this case."
1.0,The power tip on the cord it's too short allowing the cord to continually fall out of the laptop.
1.0,The battery did not work.  Will only work when plugged into an outlet.
1.0,I used this as a replacement for an Asus RT-AC66R that failed recently.  The AC66R was a replacement for another AC66R that failed a couple of years ago.  This one worked for two weeks.  All of these were being used as wireless extenders connected to another RT-AC66R configured as a router.  The AC-66R configured is a router is still working.  My experience with Asus products has been a failure rate of 75%.<br /><br />Each of these exhibited the same behavior of dropping random client connections and dropping the connection to the router.  This one is being returned to Amazon.  I'll use the refund to do what I should have done after the first failure and buy a different brand.  My recommendation to anyone looking for a new router is to avoid ASUS products.
1.0,Would give this ZERO stars if I could. As others have said SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE and the smell rubs off on your hands. Likely toxic and certainly unpleasant. Not something I would use in any indoor space. Total garbage.
1.0,"product was not ipazz as described, must be a cheap knock off"
1.0,"it broke after 2 days, and for those two days it was inconsistent while drawing on my Dell inspiron 11"
1.0,I received a device that was restricted to a specific ISP.  Something not advertised on the product page.

1.0,"Continuous panic crashs on Mac mimi.  Had to return, but they did give a full refund."
1.0,"Pros: Nice feel to it. SSD.<br /><br />Cons: Everything else. This computer seriously isn't good for anything. With a processor meant for mobile phones and a measly 2GB of RAM, this computer won't be able to handle anything more than basic internet usage. Want programs? Too bad. To balance that 2GB of RAM out, you're only given a 32GB SSD so storage is nonexistant. I had initially bought this computer to install Kali Linux on it and use it for penetration testing. I bought it with no accessories for dirt cheap, not realizing that in order to get a charger for it, I had to order it right through Asus for $40. If you buy it and need a new charger, screen, keyboard, etc. tough s***. You are SOL. Also, the device's BIOS does not support booting to an external device so installing Linux is 100% impossible on this. Secure Boot cannot be turned off, all you're allowed to boot to is Windows Boot Manager. Couldn't use &#34;WinFlash&#34; to update the BIOS anyway since it doesn't run on this machine."
1.0,The devise works great its the connection cable thats giving problems. if you mowe the laptop or the just think about moving the ssd disconnects and now you have to reconnect. also in the beginning it would nor recognize the devise and I would have to re install it few times. now using it for few months. some new developments. my laptop doesnt regognise it and it has to be reinstalled almost every time I do not have administrative rights to my laptop so it is a PAIN and if I'm out of the country it becomes useless.
1.0,0 Out of 3 worked for more than a day. DO NOT RECOMMEND! All 3 cables failed within24 hours.
1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON! I got two day shipping and it has now been I would say 6 days' yet still I do not have my tablet. also before I had bought another kindle and only had it for 6 months if that and it just stopped working on me. And they would not replace it. Mind you I had nothing to do with it from it stopping. This company sucks they are a fraud of a company!
1.0,Bought a 3-pack and all the cords quit charging within a couple of weeks of purchase. They also get so hot I was concerned about a potential fire hazard. Not Apple certified either and phones stopped recognizing the cord.
1.0,I do not like the Kindle Paperwhite. It is way too complicated and so much harder to use than the original Kindle that I had. The usage guide is a book in itself.  All of my books that were on the old Kindle did not transfer to the new one. I wish I could have just had my old one repaired.
1.0,Its not white and gold. its gray and yellow
1.0,"The current version released for the GS728TP (and the firmware mine shipped with) does not allow you to edit VLAN 1.  This wouldn't be an issue, but is also does not let you remove VLAN 2 as the untagged VLAN on any port.  This deems it unusable for any organization with anything other than a basic network configuration.  The power budget is great, but we are returning this for switches that actually have full VLAN functionality."
1.0,"WiFi expectations were very unsatisfactory.  Only one room away, speed dropped by 20%"
1.0,it was returned for refund as it didn't work
1.0,"Its a pity because I really liked the keyboard when it was working. But it met the same fate as many other reviews, one day it just wouldn't turn back on. Charged to full green light readiness and no signs of light."
1.0,Don't recommend these.  Each one stopped working after less than 5 days.
1.0,Bought a week ago and the insertable charging piece came out of the cord and was stuck in my phone.
1.0,"Because of the reputation of the Seagate name, I was confident this would be a great purchase. I was able to get the gadget for a steal. I finally broke down and purchased this external drive so that I could safely store all of my important documents in one place. After having it less than a year, it DIED!  Silly me! I am now scrambling to locate and replace all the documents lost. I need to purchase another but it will not be a Seagate product. So disappointing..."
1.0,"They don't work well at all. The plug into the phone doesn't catch the signal, so I have spent the weeks that I've had them trying trying to find a sweet spot so the phone actually charges. I finally gave up the other day and bought a cord from Rite Aid."
1.0,Terrible product.  Flimsy and looks cheap. Hard to keep it together and tends to be unstable when mounted with the keyboard.  Not cool!
1.0,I bought this for the exact model but it doesn't fit at all.
1.0,Now unable to take pictures as it not a proper fit!
1.0,The CH3 part fell out now I'm not even sure what chemical molecule it is.
1.0,The first cord I ordered broke. I figured I was being rough with it. I ordered two more because it did work and was one of few cords that fits a lifeproof case. Now one of them has stopped charging. I am not finding anyway to receive a replacement or refund. Not cool. I will have to bite the bullet and buy from Apple
1.0,"Most apps can not be moved from device to SD card.  No reason given just error message app can not be moved.  Using class 10 Samsung 32 g card.  Device will only fit 3 or 4 apps.  Bought for my son to play games, big mistake."
1.0,"We got this to play DVDs on our MacBook Air and iMac, but didn't have any luck with it.  It would sometimes recognize that a DVD was in it, but it was never able to play for more than a few seconds.  I tried using both connections on the USB cable (it has two, presumably for more power if you are not getting enough with the main plug).  I could see I/O errors in the console.  Anyway, it never worked.<br /><br />I bought [[ASIN:B007FUDKB4 Aluminum External USB DVD+RW,-RW Super Drive for Apple--MacBook Air, Pro, iMac, Mini]] -- it was a bit more expensive but it has worked flawlessly."
1.0,Didn't fix my tablet
1.0,"I purchased this router/modem combination in march of 2014 and the product now randomly stops broadcasting its SSID.  All wired connections to the unit continue to operate normally, but all wireless connections are dropped and cannot reconnect as the SSID is unavailable.  A hard reset corrects the problem for 1-2 days, after which the problem reappears and persists until another hard reset is performed.  So this unit is 5 months out of warranty and is basically useless.  After contacting Netgear about their defective product and being told that my one year warranty was up and no RMA was available I informed them that I would never purchase another Netgear product.  So here I am to tell you fine consumer, stay as far way from Netgear as you can.  Any company that refuses to stand behind their product does not deserve your hard earned dollars."
1.0,It's hard plastic and the pillow is small and doesn't help when on your lap. My notebook slid all over the top since there was nothing to anchor it or stop it.
1.0,Update: changing to 1 star. Case fell apart after only 1  year of light use. It seems like a knock off product. Glue is coming off separating the case making it useless. The case is also very stretched out creating a gap (see pic). I thought I was getting a great deal since my first apple case from the Apple Store died after 4 years and was used daily and twice the price. Little did I know this cheap knockoff case would barely last a year. What a rip off!
1.0,"after having little or no Internet service on this laptop I assumed it was Verizon's router. Had them change it twice to no avail. I canceled Verizon and had Comcast cable draw a line and hook me up. Even worse than Verizon. I called back Verizon (who were patient and understanding) and hooked up the original router. Then I tried two different signal boosters. Doing office work at home and losing Internet is frustrating to say the least. My son bought the same laptop a week before I did - he gave up on his months ago replacing it with an HP. I persevered. I never thought that it was the laptop. I bought a small Asus notebook to travel with and sat it next to my laptop and had 5 bars of signal. The Dell had noting but an icon spinning saying no Internet access. Now the laptop is out of warranty. I posted and Facebook and saw that hundreds or people were having the same issue.  After having me run diagnostic tests for two weeks Dell sent me a PM saying it was a bad wifi card, but the laptop is out of warranty. I asked their  &#34;out of warranty&#34; department to send me a new wifi card and I would pay to have it installed. They refused. A new wifi card is aobut $25. For that amount, Dell has seen my business for the last time. The laptop needs to be tossed out the window. Never Again!!!!!"
1.0,No option to give below this. I thought that the Battery had gone in just 20 uses in 2 months.. can't believe. Was very slow too. No customer service.. Worst. Can't even be repaired since it's totally gone.. seems like mother board died within 2 months.. How can I get my money back ?
1.0,"The screen failed after one week , It was the wrong screen for my computer , not Amazon's fault"
1.0,"I really liked my earlier model, which broke after 14 months, now you have really screwed up with this model of Kindle. Some objections include: when accessing the list of already purchased books, you have to sift through the illegible &#34;book covers&#34; for the titles,  3-6 at a time, which are interspersed with &#34;recommended purchases&#34; which you can accidentally buy--since you can't read the title anyway on half of the &#34;book covers&#34; anyway. Seems a guise it encourage additional purchases, accidentally.  The efficient text listing of previously purchased books utilized on the previous model was MUCH better<br /><br />Also, any random touch on the device may change the page perhaps tens of even hundreds of pages ---and finding the original site where you left off is very cumbersome at best--IF you can find it without re-reading half a dozen chapters to see where you were<br /><br />There are also some other minor complaints, but basically, it seems you took a good device which was working well, and screwed it up !!!<br /><br />Also, in an apparent effort to manipulate customers into subscribing to the &#34;Kindle Unlimited &#34; deal, the prices on individual books purchased have abruptly and dramatically increased.<br /><br />So take my advice--if you have not purchased a Kindle, DON'T--stick with books."
1.0,"Worked for a few months and died, was good when worked<br />Disappointed 😞"
1.0,"I bought this product to go with my iMac (Late 2013). However, ran into the following problems immediately:<br />- SD card doesn't show up in Finder.  I did make sure that it was inserted correctly and tried several diff cards.<br />- SuperDrive doesn't work. OS X Yosemite showed a notification that the SuperDrive needs to be plugged into the iMac directly.<br />- a wireless mouse that has a USB transmitter doesn't work<br />The only thing that worked with the USB hub is my iPhone. I'm returning this product."
1.0,"These things are absolutely not worth it. Bought this for my Canon EOS 100D and it failed within the first week! I was taking pictures normally and all of a sudden I get this message that the card could no longer be read.

1.0,"I expected that this would be faster and/or have a further reach than the old router. Overall, it's quite disappointing. Keeps kicking me off, folk stops and stutters. Wish I could return it but alas too late. Going in the garbage. Worse than the 3 year old router it replaced."
1.0,Arrived as it was supposed to. However it doesn't work. My tablet wasn't that drained but its been plugged in for thirty minutes and there is no charge at all.

See the fifth bullet point in this article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203171  Moreover, the seller was unresponsive to my request for a replacement/refund. Bad product, non-existent customer service. Don't buy this."
1.0,"[UPDATED Jan 21, 2016]<br />I have many Seagate drives and will continue to buy them. But my particular experience with this 8TB drive bears reporting and is why I give it only 1 star.<br /><br />I bought 2 of these 8TB drives, here, in late March of 2015, brand new. One was for backup of the other. The drives were on a table top and never moved. The primary drive was used heavily most days, with many concurrent reads and writes, and synced up to the secondary drive at night. Both drives were safely detached and powered down each night, until used again.<br /><br />One morning last August 2015, when I connected the primary drive to my computer, Windows suddenly now says it is seeing a &#34;ASMT 2115&#34; USB Device. In Disk Manager, this drive shows 3 partitions, 1 raw and 2 unallocated -- instead of the single NTFS partition I had in place.  I've never ever seen this kind of thing before, but a google search did report that others have had a similar situation before with other Seagate drives, but the contexts were different from mine and in the end, I could find no definitive explanation or remedy. Neither could Seagate. A senior Seagate tech person  came on to my machine remotely and we tried a number of things but the result was the same: No explanation, no solution, the drive data is lost. I returned the drive and they sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />THAT WAS THE FIRST DRIVE. Now, 4 months later the 2nd drive from this same order, which I had since made the primary heavily accessed drive, fails to connect to my computer. Different problem from the first drive: This one shows up in Devices & Printers and Device Manager as Backup+ Desk, but does NOT show up at all in Disk Manager - so it's not an issue of it being offline. Again, Seagate sent me a NEW replacement.<br /><br />So those are the facts of my experience with this drive. It's probably and hopefully a very rare isolated problem.  The serial number of this drive shared the first 7 of 8 chars with thefirst drive, ending in &#34;R&#34; while the first one ended in &#34;Q&#34; so I assume they were manufactured at the same time. Seagate would not confirm, but I suspect there were problems with the earlier production runs of this 8TB drive and I got stuck with lemons.  For one thing --- Seagate does NOT normally ship NEW drives as replacements even in warranty.<br /><br />One other problem that costs a star in my rating is that this drive cannot be used to with Windows 7 system image creation. You get a I/O error early on in the process. The same with the Seagate 5TB drives."
1.0,"Useless, screen completely detects the hand, its too thin."
1.0,Did not want
1.0,"We purchased this battery cord as a replacement for our Chromebook. This cord was tough to get to work when we first got it, we needed to have it placed just right for it to actually charge. It completely quit working over a week ago. We will not be buying from this company again!"
1.0,Had to return it because the clips to hold the keyboard in place broke off easily.
1.0,Very annoying scroll sound that cannot be turned off unless you have windows. Unless you have windows I would not buy this.
1.0,"It won't power up from sleep. If unplugged then re-inserted, it will blink briefly then drop out again. The only way out of this is rebooting my PC. The utility app is useless and errors out all the time, so I have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers only, without the utility app. No luck here either. A very bad experience!"
1.0,This cord died in less than three months.  I will be ordering a new cord from another company.
1.0,Purchased in April. Failed in July. Beware.
1.0,I received a product used with scratches. I made the claim and the refund is made.
1.0,A huge waste of money.
1.0,"A total waste of money must be from china, bubbles very hard to remove and this can scratch very easy."

1.0,These worked for about a month. None of them charge my phone now which is super annoying. Thanks a lot Qable. POS
1.0,If you are using OSX Mavericks you will be disappointed.  The problem is that this device does not work and causes the monitor hooked through it so disconnect or freeze.  It seems to be a software/ firmware issue and not resolved by either driver install they offer on their website.

I connected the Surface docking with the DP input of the first screen (mini display port to display port and the output display port of the first screen to the DP input port of the second screen.<br />I still have a small problem.  The second display do not wakes up automatic, I have to push a button on the screen to wake it up.<br />Amazon refund the DVI splitter without any discussion."
1.0,Purchased for someone else and she had to return it as zipper was defective.
1.0,Not very happy with this product. Only accepted 1/2 of my files and stated the raining files were corrupted when they were not. I threw the packaging away otherwise I would return it!
1.0,"Setup only took about 20 minutes. Not bad. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was positive about this. I tried to go with the Windows 10 upgrade. After 3 hours, the download part had only progressed about 25%. I stopped the download, and went ahead with my regular light web browsing. Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength.<br />A couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times.<br />This evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was &#34;Welcome&#34; for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back.<br />My tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap. Spend a couple hundred extra, and you probably won't be disappointed. In this case, I definitely got what I paid for, and that is the most expensive paperweight."
1.0,item is lost ...
1.0,"this chill mat is horrible, extremely uncomfortable to have on my lap, fans are loud and the adjustments for the tilt is just laughable as it doesn't stay put.<br />so dont be like me and waste time and $$ on this junk<br /><br />i honestly don't have anything good to say about it. i despise it so much that i am not even going to waste my time sending it back, Im going to take it to the range and use it for target practice.<br /><br />there are plenty of better laptop coolers out there."
1.0,Junk...
1.0,"I didn't buy this thru amazon, but through Sprint, which charged quite a bit more for it. In 4 months, we have been through TWO of these, both for the reason many others noted: the hinge fails easily and miserably.

1.0,"I'm a retired IT Professional that spent over 30 years in IT with a primary focus on data communications. I'm technically competent enough to understand router technologies. Linksys has either idiots on the Technical Support for this router or the router has some serious design flaws.<br />I bought one from amazon and don't have any issue with them. BUT, after several lengthy conversations, the only way they determined that could resolve my problem was to send a replacement. Replacement has the same issue - consistent speed problems that kept my iMac at about 30mbps with a speed out of my Motorola cable modem in the 90mbps. I run an iMac A7 which screams and needs the more bandwidth than this router can provide. Only other item running through the router is an iPad OR my wife's Dell laptop. Finally replaced with a Netgear product that works like a champ. STAY AWAY from this router if you need a WiFi Router that works at higher speeds."
1.0,"Bad, photos disappear"
1.0,did not work
1.0,"This is the worst computer I have ever used. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. I purchased the laptop at Frys, the Internet Explorer and WiFi didn't work so I returned it within one week. The techs there were not able to fix it and gave me a new one. The new one is also not working properly. The Internet Explorer and wifi also do not work. I contacted Frys who refused to replace it and told me to contact Acer directly. I contacted Acer requesting a refund. They refused to do so. I was on the phone for 1 hour with them, got terrible customer service and no resolution. They told me to mail in my laptop at my own expense. I am an independent contractor and need my laptop to work. I told the customer service rep this and she told me to borrow a family member's computer. This is not a solution. The end result: I have to mail in the laptop, wait for them to look at it and try to repair it. Since Frys was unable to fix the first lemon, I doubt they will be able to fix this one. I wasted $1400, not including the software I purchased for the laptop."
1.0,"I bought this.  I needed a question answered.  So I wrote Samsung Support.  It took me half an hour to even find their form on their website, and it doesn't list this model as a dropdown.<br /><br />They said they can't even answer a simple spec unless I'm fully registered.<br /><br />I'm not going to register because I hate Samsung spam.  I have a 4-year old Sony Vaio.  Everything on my Vaio runs twice as fast as Book9.  This is so slow it's a dog.  I wish I could return it and get my money back."
1.0,Wrong size.  The one that arrived is 28.2mm wide.  Width at the hinge points is 14.4mm.  Original Beats headband that I'm trying to replace is 25mm wide and 11.4mm at the hinge points (measured inside-to-inside).<br /><br />Be sure to check the width you need.  Beats headband sizes have apparently changed over time or between models.
1.0,Error 28<br />Nothing else to say
1.0,"Two out of three cables died within two weeks of using them.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to post this before my 30 day guarantee with Amazon expired.  Do yourself a favor and buy the more expensive cable.  It will pay for itself, especially when you put your phone on the charger all night only to wake up to no alarm clock and a dead phone."
1.0,"This is my first from Seagate, and I doubt I will be buying from them again. Since day one it has not been working as it is supposed to; random disconnects whilst r/w, causing transfers to fail. My drivers are up to date. I have tried using different connectors, different ports, computers, to no luck. I then shut off the power saving feature on the computer and the drive, but I still get the same issue. I never had to go though the same with other brands.<br /><br />I did my research, and the issue appears to be fairly common. I have no other choice but to buy another drive and patiently transfer my data bit by bit before sending it in. How inconvenient."
1.0,"I Got the Anker mouse and keyboard, this keyboard always has connection issue, I have to wait for  one or two minute until it works, change battery for three times still has issues, ,"
1.0,This case is the worst! The keyboard never worked and the keys starting falling off after 3 weeks! The entire thing fell apart after a month of having it and now i'm unable to return or exchange it!  DO NOT BUY!
1.0,"I was excited to get this item to complete my archiving of a few thousand 3.5 disks. With anticipation I plugged in this device, and popped in what I had hoped would be the first of many insights into data I had deemed worthy enough to keep. The drive made a horrible buzzing noise, and then after a period of time Windows dinged saying simple that it could not communicate to the drive.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacture and they said &#34;You probably got a bad drive, send us an email with the proof of purchase, and we will test a drive here and replace it.&#34;. I thought WOW that is great customer service. So I complied. After a week of not hearing back I called them. Got the same guy on the phone, this time he said &#34;When did you buy it?&#34; to which I replied on 8/19, and he said&#34; Oh send it back to them and get another one.<br /><br />So I sat for a week expecting them to at least reply to the email I sent, waiting to get a replacement that they had no intention of sending.<br /><br />The moral of this story is simply AVOID ANYTHING MADE BY SABRENT."
1.0,"Bought it for performance work. At first it worked incredibly well, very fast and reliable; easy to carry around. It started after a couple of months to unmount out of the blue, randomly and not associated with any task, whether in use or just plugged in. Today it won't mount at all, jeopardizing important work. Got a GDrive for their reputation and I'm experiencing the complete opposite. I will update my review based on a concrete solution."
1.0,"This product lasted less than a year before it broke - The left mouse button stopped working.  I use this for a rarely used home computer, so I can imagine this mouse wouldn't hold up to daily use for more than a few months."
1.0,Terrible experience! I typed in the part number from the original battery. The battery worked for a few weeks and then the computer died. We took the computer to a computer place and they said the mother board was burned because we had installed the wrong battery. :((
1.0,It has Bluetooth 2.0. It doesn't not state this anywhere. Some of my Bluetooth devices would not work with it because of this.<br /><br />Mine also had a defect with the screen. It almost looks like a crack but it is under the screen. I will never again buy an off brand tablet.<br /><br />I ended up returning mine and going with Acer Iconia Tab 10 A3-A20-K1AY.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.
1.0,I have a Kindle Fire HD and this does NOT fit right. It covers the buttons. You have to take the Kindle out of the case to turn it on! Do not buy!
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,"Just as someone else had experienced, the cable started having issues after only a few days. At first, I had to wiggle it into a particular position to get it to work, and then it ceased to work completely. Bad QC I guess.<br /><br />I haven't tried to return it, because my time is worth more money than what it's worth. If they sent me a package to return it, I would, but I'm not going to all the trouble of sending it back. I got another cable by another manufacturer (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TZH85K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it's working properly so far. If the second one fails, I'll probably buy an Apple version of the product, because I have to have it this or two of my monitors become useless for my Intel NUC."
1.0,"Battery died within one month of purchase. Holds 0% charge, even when not running. Was unable to return it by the return date and now I'm stuck with a useless $50 rock."

1.0,"Will not find channels any way you try it.<br /><br />Customer service is present and were reasonable.<br /><br />Here is the tip:<br />If this take more than a couple of minutes installing - it is defective.  When it gets to the driver screen, if it takes more than 2 minutes (mine took just over 5 - yes I timed it) it is bad.  Don't spend you whole Sunday, installing, re-installing, re-scanning channels, and trying to read and configure your system.  It does not work.  Maybe you are one of the lucky few that it work for out of the box.<br /><br />I'm so upset with the time I have wasted with this I don't know if I could bear the thought of doing an exchange.

1.0,Great monitor with incredible screen resolution -- for the first 35 days then screen covered in vertical colored lines.  Failed just past the Amazon return deadline.  Heavy call volumes so can't get through to a Dell representative.  Can't use Dell's warranty chat because monitors don't have service tags.  Pissed off at having wasted $400.

And when we'd log on... BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP until we hit all the keys. It just got worse from there. Today we got the infamous Blue Screen of Death after it wouldn't load for 5 minutes. Sometimes it just stops at the Resuming Windows..../Launching Windows...... screen. THIS is the computer that we have to get on to play Spore (2008), Train Simulator 2015 (2014), etc., because there Windows games and we currently have a mac.

1.0,"I bought this used, real cheap, as a test to see if I could use a Netgear Router with ReadySHARE on a DSL system. Although it claimed to work with all types of DSL, it did not work with Frontier. It seemed to initialize and startup correctly. All the lights, including DSL, were showing as anticipated except the Internet. This means that DSL made a connection. The Internet light remained steady red. I was not able to change this even by following troubleshooting instructions. I was also not able to access the modem router through my browser at the given address 192.168.0.1. I wound up giving it to someone who assured me they could get it going. Decided to go Frontier's ActionTEC [[ASIN:B00JWUOWDU Actiontec DSL Modem F2250]] modem router, which was working fine. It just did not have the functionality I have been used to over the years with my Netgear Routers, especially the [[ASIN:B00HEX851C Netgear WNDR4500 N900 Dual Band Gigabit Wifi Router]] which I have been using lately in several locations with the USB port & ReadySHARE capability. Luckily, I was able to get an open box [[ASIN:B00BR3XGP0 NETGEAR AC1200 WiFi DSL Modem Router 802.11ac Dual Band Gigabit (D6200)]] still in plastic &#34;for a song&#34;--no one seemed to want it because there was no User Guide.

1.0,didn't work on my mac
1.0,It was the wrong size and was difficult to put on.
1.0,"It would of been absolutely perfect, if it wasn't for that right after i got it, the pointer started shifting one little click to the left every few seconds, wouldn't even be that bad of a problem, if it wasn't for the play menu coming up every time on netflix, and other programs that run full screen. Other then that, it would have gotten 5 stars."
1.0,"We bought 2 of these and they are both already broken.<br /><br />This tablet didn't even last a month before we started having issues. The screen would go black for no reason or the whole picture would become distorted. Youtube would freeze randomly and games would force close. We bought this tablet because we were buying for our kids. We thought we didn't need to spend a lot on a tablet that would just be playing a few games and watching youtube... well we were wrong. Like I said before, didn't even last a month before we started having issues and now it won't even turn on. It's a paper weight now. The 2nd tablet we bought force closes games and now for some reason ALL of the buttons are breaking. They are sinking into the tablet and they are now extremely hard to push. The power button is the worst and sometimes we can't even get the tablet to turn on because the button is almost all the way gone. We will have a 2nd paper weight very soon.<br /><br />We messaged customer service asking what we could do and they told us we could ship it back (we pay for shipping) THEN we pay a $10 fee (per tablet) for them to fix it BUT the $10 charge was only if they found the product to be defective. If they found it was &#34;damaged&#34; by us then we would have to pay more for it to be fixed or replaced. The thing that worried me is that although I asked TWICE how much it would cost us to fix it if they claimed it was damaged by us, they never answered my question. I'm not going to pay the same amount to fix is as we did to buy it. It's not worth it.<br /><br />***To customer service: If you guys want to fix my tablet and not charge me more than $10 (because these things are DEFINITELY defective), then I will change my review on the customer service aspect."
1.0,still no speaker or headphone jack?  how are we supposed to sync with audible books?
1.0,"Within a week, the rubber ear pieces came off and there is NO way to attach them back on.  Very disappointed."
1.0,Was not a 6 ft cord and didn't fit the laptop
1.0,Don't buy from from this seller under any circumstnces. The item will never work; it is counterfeit so Windows won't recognize it. People who are saying it worked or there is a fix are making bogus reviews. I spent a whole day downloading those supposedly fixes and they did not do anything other than render my laptop unstable. I both 2 of those from these bandits and none did not work.  And shame on them. I am giving then 1 star because I cannot give 0 or a negative value.
1.0,"Not that great. I bought this thinking it would be a quality product, noting that it was made by 3M. However, a few weeks in and I am ready to toss it in the trash. First, the filter is not a &#34;film&#34; as you might expect. It's a sheet of plastic. It has weight to it and will move around on you. At least 5-6 times I have come back to my computer and the filter has become detached from the screen and was laying on my keyboard. Other times, the plastic doesn't stay flush with the screen and bows out, causing distortion in the image. I would not recommend this product to others."
1.0,"This item is, at least now, not required for purchase, if you wish to power your Fire via a USB port. It's just a USB cable, which is now included with the Fire device, as a cord connecting the Fire to a small adapter plug (a common accessory nowadays). If you wish to power your Fire via USB, just connect the cable that comes with the Fire directly to the USB port on your TV (unless that port happens to be very far away, in which case any another longer USB cord with the same ends will suffice, one MicroUSB plug and one regular square USB plug), rather than to the included plug."
1.0,"Not very happy with it. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Easy set up, worked fine for 2 days. Then started having problems with playing videos on Facebook<br /> Spent hours on the phone with tech support. Still unable to play videos. Also the touch-screen is not very responsive."
1.0,It fractured after 1 month
1.0,After 2 months stop working
1.0,Too big for my 7 inch screen
1.0,Mouse Scroll did not work
1.0,"This was delivered during the summer at our school.  When it was opened at the beginning of the school year the pen had a battery already inserted inside which had corroded and ruined the pen.  I understand that it was past the time for returns, but it was also suppose to be in unopened box with the pen and battery separate.  I am not looking for any replacements because of the late date."
1.0,"Absolute junk. Poor image quality. Flimsy construction. (It fell apart in my hands taking it out of the box.) The method for updating firmware is a joke. It does NOT connect with the Amcrest NVR that Foscam sells, even though Foscam tells you it does. (Amcrest tech support told me they have LOTS of problems with Foscam cameras, ESPECIALLY THE C1.) If you for some reason decide to purchase this garbage, put Foscam's tech support phone number in your speed dial-you're gonna need it.<br />AVOID-AVOID-AVOID!!!!"
1.0,This was really misleading as it was listed as xxl......... no bigger than a standard mouse pad.  What a waste of money!!!!!!
1.0,Microphone worked great for about a week then just died. May it rest in peace. Returned. Tried to buy from another site and they emailed me that the product was not up to their standards so they pulled it off the site.
1.0,i thought it was something else
1.0,"Hi<br /><br />I bought this laptop about a month ago. Upon opening the laptop i noticed the CD drive stuck out from the line of the laptop. This misalignment of the CD drive is not something i would expect from  a + $800 laptop. Another problem with the CD drive is that in the advertised pictures the CD drive is Blu ray. The other night i tried using a blue ray disk and the computer read nothing.<br /><br />Another problem... when typing, most times i press the space bar it squeaks.<br /><br />Defiantly not what i expected, i don't advise getting this laptop for yourself."
1.0,The letters and numbers on the keyboard cover I received were not centered on each key. You could not use the lights on your keyboard with this due to the off-centered lettering. Also the color was not as bright as the photos online. I will be returning this
1.0,"Didn't last 2 months. Bought this & 3 Irulu 7 tablets at the same time and this one being used less stopped working, won't take a charge, not worth the extra money."
1.0,This battery did not last one hour.  The amount of money charged for this battery was totally not worth it.  Even though they returned most of my money I would not recommend it at all for any reason.  Save your money with this company.
1.0,It doesn't stick to your screen.
1.0,P.O.S....
1.0,The cable I got is not Displayport 1.2 compliant.  It had the exact same behaviour and issues as from 2 Displayport 1.1 compliant cables that I had.  This item is either packaged wrong or faulty.  4K monitors require Displayport 1.2 compliant cables.  They are hard to find and you have to be vary careful checking the specs before buying.  All the reports of 4K monitors going into sleep mode or going black after seeming to work are because of using non-compliant cables.  Most retailers are not up to speed with these specs.
1.0,"Good E-reader before it stops working.  After a few month, my kindle had problem to connect to the Cloud to download booked I've already paid for. I spent more than 5 hours on 7 or 8 calls in addition to about 10 emails with the Kindle support team. The problem is still not resolved. And the kindle customer support never ever get back to me even after repeatedly promised to do so.  What made the whole experience beyond ridicule is that my credit card was charge by &#34;Amazon Services-Kindle&#34; for the the issue they've never fixed or care to fix."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on these!  You get what you pay for.  This product is a potential fire hazard!<br /><br />2 of the 3 charging cords began heating up at the iphone plug side, (enough to burn my fingertip), before I unplugged to let it cool down.  After the cords were allowed to cool down, they no longer worked with my iPhone 5s.  Since I view this product as a fire hazard, or worst case - damaging my phone, I simply threw the 3rd one away, along with the other 2 useless cords."
1.0,There was a green dot and a white line across the screen. I was very disappointed in the fact that I received a broken screen to replace my already broken screen
1.0,It took a network engineer to figure out why my WiFi network was so slow.  He said this extender was delaying and dropping packets even though the radio signal was steady.  Replaced it with a Netgear extender and now everything is working great.
1.0,I received this item as an xmas gift. While it does work good I stopped using is do to heat concerns. It gets very hot and starting to melt the plastic. recommend purchasing a different product. I am afraid it will catch on fire.
1.0,"This is the worst computer I have ever used. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. I purchased the laptop at Frys, the Internet Explorer and WiFi didn't work so I returned it within one week. The techs there were not able to fix it and gave me a new one. The new one is also not working properly. The Internet Explorer and wifi also do not work. I contacted Frys who refused to replace it and told me to contact Acer directly. I contacted Acer requesting a refund. They refused to do so. I was on the phone for 1 hour with them, got terrible customer service and no resolution. They told me to mail in my laptop at my own expense. I am an independent contractor and need my laptop to work. I told the customer service rep this and she told me to borrow a family member's computer. This is not a solution. The end result: I have to mail in the laptop, wait for them to look at it and try to repair it. Since Frys was unable to fix the first lemon, I doubt they will be able to fix this one. I wasted $1400, not including the software I purchased for the laptop."
1.0,Don't be fooled when you check the properties of the card because it will show 128Gb which must be accomplished by some cleaver software programming?<br />7.4Gb per h2testw testing.<br />I tried on two different computers to download 8Gb of music files and it could not store over about 8Gb.<br />I tried formatting on two different (Windows) computers and it could not complete the formatting.<br />Fortunately Amazon is going to refund my ~ $22.
1.0,Nice product but does not work
1.0,"I got a Kindle Fire in 2012. It will not charge anymore, have tried four different cords. Called amazon, admitted known problem but only offered discounted new one. This is my third Kindle purchase. Disappointed in AmaZon and I am Very good customer!"
1.0,"not good at all. after a week, a key felt down"
1.0,The magnet is not strong enough to stick on the gas tank.
1.0,"Just like Markus L. Nightmare of a case. I tried to save money (didn't want to spend $600+ on an iMac case). Now I have a worthless $200 iLugger and a $600 cracked screen repair bill from apple = $800 I could've spent on a case that would've actually protected the Mac. Cardboard box it shipped in would've been better. Take it from myself and Markus. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!<br /><br />(for the record - I was very careful when transporting the mac in the case. I didn't assume this thing could take much abuse, but I figured it would be better than nothing. It's not)"
1.0,These do not work 99% of the time
1.0,It is not very well made. The fabric wasn't stretched right and so there were a lot of visible big air bubbles.
1.0,One of the sticks didnt work
1.0,The case itself is okay but there was a long cut across the leather I thought it was the design but it was too late when I realized that was not the case I had already rated it.
1.0,the case is great - hard and protected my fire when dropped.
1.0,"I get 50Mbps with direct wire but with one device wired through this switch the speed drops to 7Mbps. Not the direct pass through advertised. The barely-any-English Tech Support was difficult to reach, highly scripted, and less than helpful.  I will return for exchange of same product, still hopeful I got a bad unit.  I'll update this review after receiving replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE: Replacement unit was comparable in poor performance to the first. In the end, I failed receive a product consistent with the product description, specifically: &#34;full wire-speed&#34;. It works, yes, but at 1/3 the speed of my wireless connection and 1/7 the speed of direct wire.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone who has other options."
1.0,"At the time of this writing, this product has five 5-star reviews. A look at the reviewer accounts shows that four of them simultaneously wrote similar or identical reviews for several other (questionable) products, all from the same small group of sellers. The remaining review is a cut & paste of a recent SanDisk SD card review, with the word &#34;SanDisk&#34; clumsily removed wherever it appeared. See &#34;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3IFXVSB4B5Y&#34; for the cut&paste source.<br /><br />If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is.<br /><br />The other red flag is price, which is about 40% below the expected price or real memory. The flash drive and SD card memory market is highly competitive, and there just isn't that much room for a generic to come in at such a low price. If a price seems too good to be true, it often is.<br /><br />I advise extreme caution. Your valuable data is at risk.<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as &#34;SDHC&#34; (not &#34;SDXC&#34;). The SD card association controls and licenses the SD card standards and they define &#34;SDHC&#34; up to a maximum capacity of 32GB. For larger capacity cards, only the &#34;SDXC&#34; standard is valid.<br /><br />There are plenty of good 32GB SD cards are out there. Expect to pay roughly $15 and up for 32GB (as of Q3 2015) and significantly more for 64GB and 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.aximum capacity of 32GB.

1.0,It just did not work for me.
1.0,Damaged!!!!<br />Can provide pic if needed!!!!
1.0,"The case is great - but the cutouts don't fit the LG GPad 8.3 I got from Verizon just last month. If your speakers are on the same (L/R) side as the camera lens, it won't fit yours either. It's a shame, really."
1.0,"Do not buy this headset, i learned the hard way that this model is known to be deffective. There is a ear bleeding buzzing noise that cannot be fixed."
1.0,when they said to help dry with a air dryer...I stopped and returned it.
1.0,Horrible!
1.0,Bad product.  Had to return as hard disk failed.
1.0,"As others have point out, if it's too good to be true, it probably is.<br /><br />I barely had any dirt on my Macbook Air screen (no liquid stains or sticky residue) but all these wipes did was create smudges after smudges. Needed about 5 wipes just to get it to a decent state. So here I am now left w/ 15 wipes and based on the amount I need for the MBA application, I can use them on 3 other devices @ most (w/ a similar screen real estate as the MBA)<br /><br />Also, they are VERY DRY out of the box. So pls do yourself a favor & go w/ a liquid spray cleaner + a microfiber cloth combination. Glad it only cost $6."
1.0,Wont't work for tablets
1.0,Did not work to use PS/2 keyboard with USB port.
1.0,"The sound quality is decent, but that's the only thing to like about these stiff, creaky, cheap-feeling, pinchy headphones. The in-line volume control introduces noise when it is used. The on-ear ear pads are not comfortable on actual ears. The boom mic doesn't mute when raised. Truly disappointing."
1.0,disconnects every 10 or so minutes.  worked well for a month or two.  now i have to buy a new keyboard :(
1.0,My tablet screen cracked because of the case the pen cracked it
1.0,"Got it for use in an HP laptop with an Intel Celeron processor but it came back with an Error &#34;unable to start device Error code 10&#34;. Tried it in Asus, Dell, and Sony same issue in all four."
1.0,Just note that all 5 star reviews come on the same day like Aug 29th. Obvious scam and they should mention doesn't even work on note 4...
1.0,The cords are not held tightly and fall out. Spacing is too wide.
1.0,"We got Lost and Stolen item and Xfinity wouldn't activate it<br />[ASIN:B006IJHK96 Linksys Advanced DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem, Certified for Comcast and Compatible with Major Cable Providers (DPC3008-CC)]]"
1.0,DONT BUY THIS IT DOESNT EVEN WORK
1.0,these didn't work had to return
1.0,"Definitely the worst set of speakers I've used. Wish i could give no stars. I've given 1 star to products that perform poorly, but is it fair to give 1 to a product that performs poorly and prices as ridiculously as it's performance? Ignore my 1 star it's actually a zero."
1.0,"I purchased recently, seem to work for a few hours, then became very sluggish.  The next day  cpu wouldn't even start, I removed and installed old ram the cpu loaded and worked fine.  I would not purchase again, not worth the hazzle.  I contacted seller, they responded with an email to test the memory, to see if bad stick, yes there is one."
1.0,Very poor quality. Runs slow. After 2 months wouldn't stay on with out being plugged in.. Less than 6 months and battery blew up inside.
1.0,Does not work in my 10.1 tablet. Does not work in my new FIRE. Does not work in a card reader. It does not work! Never did. Found out too late to return the POS.
1.0,"cannot hold much memory at all! i had a total of 10 games on there,no photos or videos and it was at full capasity. wish i would of known that before i purchased the product."
1.0,Can not activate because it is a comcast modem that is only for rental.
1.0,"Day I bought it, it would randomly disconnect within a foot of the wireless receiver, even after updating the firmware.  The sound quality of the headset isn't that good either as well as it's pseudo surround sound feature.  If you're going to invest money in a good headset, invest in a Sennheiser.  Not only do they sound much better, the build quality matches.<br /><br />This is definitely a headset that is getting returned."
1.0,"Even i chose the cover for iPad mini, I got the one for a normal iPad."
1.0,Increase the signal but is not steady at all. It is not useful.
1.0,Could not get it to work with windows 8.1
1.0,Did not work in any outlet I saw in Denmark. It does not fit the outlet. Simply the wrong design.
1.0,Zipper broke day 2. Not much else to say!
1.0,"This package contains two microphones.  The larger, which I was hoping to use, did not work.  It was dead out of the package.  The smaller one works fine.  Fortunately Amazon returns are very easy."

1.0,"the quality was just too poor to describe. bought one from fry's on sale for about $11.00 with mail-in rebate for promotion. used about 1 month or so, it just stopped working. poor materials, weak structure, loud fan noise....etc., etc. don't buy it even it offers for free. just one more junk for recycle bin."

1.0,"Purchased 256 G flash drive. Drive received was labeled as 256 G; however, drive only had 32G of memory. I'd be very leary of purchasing this product."
1.0,Just got this today. First i noticed that it come with 2 usb ports one you have to use to plug it up so you only really get one extra. Also set up on my laptop and started running it for like 20minutes then laptop crashed. I have HP dv7. Where it vents from the corner and theres really no fan in the corner. Maybe my 17inch laptop is 2 big but the only thing i liked about it is its quiet and clips that keep your laptop in one place.
1.0,"I bought this battery to replace my original Dell battery which had to stay plugged in all the time because it used up its charge. I expected this battery to last long as a brand new one.  But to my surprise, it only lasts 2 1/2 hrs on screen saver mode.  I wasn't even using it!  I expected this being a Dell battery it would work.  I could've bought a generic brand much much cheaper but thought going with the Dell brand would've been a  much better product.  I was wrong. I haven't decided if I'm going to send it back or use it as an extra battery for emergency use."
1.0,"low quality, it stop charging the battery at the second day of use, it just stopped detecting its own power adapter as a valid one and refuses to charge the batter.<br /><br />Not buying DELL again, their AC jack is to poor quality."
1.0,It did not fit my macbook pro at all! It was only 12 inches and my mac is 13 inches. Not sure if they sent me the wrong thing or not.
1.0,I only got this because amazon said its was it was the only I shouldn't buy with the  tablet I getting an it don't work.
1.0,This is the worst product I have ever gotten from Amazon.  No customer support.  They will not return my calls.  The tablet stopped working after 90 days and no I get an email saying that the warranty is good for only 90 days.  Don't waste your money!!!!  One Star is too much for this piece of garbage!!!
1.0,"I really wanted to love this thing... however, it will not mount my external hard drive or an 8GB miniSD card. It charges my phone, and will sync with iTunes, but I don't need a USB 3.0 hub to do that.<br /><br />Will be returning it because I can't use it."
1.0,"Because the cable is flat it gets kinks in it. Does not let enough power through to charge my phone at the correct rate, so complete charge ups are long. The biggest problem are the connections on the mini usb end that houlds it in my phone.  They wore down in a few weeks. The bulb lights up my room at night, so I had to put my phone under the bed. I say had because I threw it out because it kept slipping outof my phone."
1.0,Product description did not match the product I received. The timing was different.
1.0,DID NOT WORK
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE.  I've had to replace it 3x, and on the 4th replacement I gave up and just took their 80% refund.  That's right, they would not refund 100% when the Kindle never worked properly.<br /><br />Now let me tell you about how I used it... I used it to repeat ONE song to put my kids to sleep.  It only repeated an ocean waves/white noise song.  Over and over, it's only task.  Three different kindles, all ended up frozen on either the AMAZON screen or the FIRE screen.<br /><br />They were very kind to send replacements.  Sure they came quickly but they all froze doing the same task even w/ different song files.  Save yourself the money and the headache of continually replacing this thing.  I plan on using my 80% refund on buying a real white noise machine which I know will not freeze."
1.0,No on/off switch. Worked for approximately 5 seconds. Total waste of money. Don't bother.
1.0,"Horrible in all ways possible. Bought this to replace another iRulu device that broke. Had it for less six months and it gave us problems the whole time through. Never was told about a 90- money back guarantee. And in their year warranty (that I found out after I tried to send it back), I must pay half to &#34;replace&#34; it. Never will I purchase such cheap equipment from this company. I bought a case for it and used it for email, browsing, and apps even with light use, it couldn't handle it. Both devices broke! And both devices were broken due to internal damage. Nothing on my part. I highly recommend AGAINST this product and the iRulu brand in general! Horrible product quality and horrible customer service! DON'T BUY!!"
1.0,Ive been having issues with this product ever since I received it.
1.0,Broken within hours.
1.0,Ipad does not stay in the hinge portion when closing.
1.0,"No matter how many times I tried, I could not get it to install properly. My monitor would not recognize the card. I have used Radeon products in the past without any problems. Could not figure this one out."
1.0,Does not fit regular phone
1.0,"Within about 5 minutes of being connected to any of several different Macbooks, audio from the mic would become garbled, requiring that I unplug and then reconnect the headset in order to be understood.<br /><br />Another problem is that the headset does not provide monitoring of the input signal. The earcups provide great isolation, which means that you can't hear yourself talking with the headset on, which stinks."
1.0,It keeps disconnecting and the volume isn't that high
1.0,Was fine at first but after a month I noticed chipping on the corners. Soon it was cracking and pieces were breaking off. I have never dropped it or even been hard on it.  Terrible!
1.0,"Received defective unit, it initialize as usb cable, but nothing happens after that. Tried to connect it to my Mac and it didn't even show up. The first generation looked tiny and it had LED activity indicator."
1.0,"After 3 Kindle Fires I bought a Samsung tablet and discovered that the on/off button does not break, it does not lock up, it does not prevent you from watching videos other than Amazon, it is much faster and it is cheaper! Whatever you do: do NOT buy a Kindle!"
1.0,Overheated and died on first use. Total waste!
1.0,Charges too slow. Even with the box that came with your phone originally the cord makes it charge slow
1.0,"After installing this software it seems to have damaged my operating system to the point that I had to rebuild my computer from the ground up. When I called the company for support (their 800 number) they said that their software had never had a problem. I am running Windows 10 and MS OFFICE PRO 2013.<br />I also gave him access to my machine. He then began asking me questions about the age of my computer, operating system, etc. Eventually he pulled up my task manager and showed me that all Microsoft items had stopped. He said that my computer was unstable and that I needed a level 3 technician's help to &#34;fix&#34; my VERY damaged computer (which was working fine before installing this product&#34;).<br />They were willing to provide a level 3 technician for a price!!! I knew it was useless to continue and hung up.<br />Having been in the computer industry since 1967 I decided to fix it myself which took several hours but now my computer is back working fine. I would NEVER EVER install this on any computer in the future (BTW - I bought my computer just 6 months ago and it is quite powerful and has never had an issue."
1.0,"Video quality was poor, I will not be using this device."
1.0,I have been using this computer for months now. streaming videos and t.v shows are soooooo slow. loading pages so slow. the audio speakers and headphone output are horrible. I am sad that I didn't return this thing when I had the chance. but I wanted it to be great and I wanted to give it a shot but this computer has turned out to be a huge waste of money. it makes me sick that I spent this money on this thing. oh and I constantly get programing errors and glitches like icons on my desktop that shouldn't be there and I cant even click on it to remove it. I am telling you there are major issues with this machine.
1.0,"I have had a few different cases for the iPad and iPad mini over the years, but this is the worst one that I've come across. It is cheaply made and does not feel great to the touch, but given the price, it is acceptable (but there are others that don't feel as bad). My biggest issue is that once the cover was put on my iPad mini, I couldn't plug anything in!!! The plastic cover surrounding the precious few inputs on the iPad (lightning connector and headphone) block many connectors from making enough contact with the device. The manufacturer designed the cover to create small openings just around the camera, speaker, power button, volume, speaker, and dock. These are very form fitting and looked nice at first, but really limit what you can do or plug in to the device. The camera connection kit did not plug in. My adapter for 30 pin to lightning did not fit. Even my headphone plug did not fit inside the space allocated in the case. Basically I would have to take the iPad out of the case in order to plug in headphones or anything other than a straight lightning cable. I am not sure who actually uses this or how it has 10,000+ reviews that are generally positive? I would avoid this."
1.0,THE Tablet Is GOOD But THE CHARGER Doesn't CHARGE. I have to use my charger to my phone.l need another charger sent to me...
1.0,"This caddy is not compatible with my Asus N56VJ, so I'm a little upset and very disappointed."
1.0,"Doesn't charge my Kindle Fire 8.9HDX. If you jiggle the cord and hold it, the charging symbol appears but once you remove your hand, it's gone again. Hours later, it hasn't charged at all."
1.0,It doesn't cover the entire keyboard. And it doesn't stay in place.
1.0,"I got this laptop at Walmart a few years ago because I needed a cheap one, fast. You get what you pay for. I think my old dial-up desktop was faster than this!!"
1.0,"These are for people with extremely small ears, and if you can get them to fit comfortably don't expect amazing audio either. my 15$ jvc headphones are 100 times better do yourself a favor and go with a much better brand or model. So far this is definitely on the list of my biggest purchase regrets. If I can't return it and get some amount of my money back these are going straight in the garbage most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn, airplane headphones offer more comfort."
1.0,"The back portion doesn't properly attach to the back which means you can't stand up your device. In order to return it, I had to pry off the case with a friend bc it was such a hard fit. Not worth the money."
1.0,It didn't work...at all.
1.0,Worst charger I've ever bought. For the price you're paying for this charger you think you would at least be able to get use out of it. I opened it up and plugged it in and it immediately said &#34;USB not supported&#34;. so disappointed!
1.0,"This router is fast and had a lot of great features. Unfortunately in the 7 months I've owned it, it has consistently given me headaches.<br />Initially it would drop all wireless connections randomly, and show that it was not connected to the internet, when in fact it was.<br />Recently it has started lagging on the wireless connections every 8 minutes, making online gaming nearly impossible. When I switched back to my ancient (slow) linksys router, all connection issues went away, but unfortunately so did the fast speed and long range."
1.0,The colors are NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS IN THE PICTURE. And the product is not worth anything above $3.
1.0,did not work with my laptop. started getting bluescreen
1.0,doesnt work with any of the things that i put it up to.<br />also if you are looking for this to use on a game console then it doesnt work
1.0,"Good:<br />-- Backlighting is great.<br />-- USB response faster than a wireless (I'd suggest a Keyscrambler too).<br />Bad:<br />--  It suddenly quit after just six months.<br />-- The painted keys quickly faded into illegibility.<br />-- Clunky, sticky keys make typing more sloppy and imprecise."
1.0,"Thunderbolt cable chip of item was damaged, I've paid additional 80$ for service to fix it."
1.0,It did not work when it arrived. I already returned it for a refund. I don't plan on buying a refurbished item again.
1.0,"The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB.

The top capacity on the market is the 1TB Kingston Predator.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.  You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each.

The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

1.0,This item did not fit my Kindle fire 8.9.  I had to return it and try another item.
1.0,"Not great. Whenever you unplug headphones it won't switch back to the internal speakers until you restart it. Restart only takes a few seconds, but still. It's irritating."
1.0,"The things a piece of crap. Low quality, not worth the price at all. I haven't been able to use it at all because it won't stay synced with my Xbox for longer than 2 seconds before it tries to sync again and it does that constantly"
1.0,Unfortunately did not work with my military CAC card...wanted drivers and other info.......
1.0,Good for carrying but that's about it tablet is totally unusable with case on. I always have to take tablet our for my son to play with. Which makes this product worthless because he can still break it
1.0,it broke in 2 days
1.0,This board is garbage. I bought one from a computer store in Dallas ( first mistake ) that had a ridiculously hard return policy. The board had NMI hardware failures that shut down my pc at random intervals. Once I finally got he board back it had the same problem. There is no service after the sale from ASROCK. Several emails begging for help have gone unanswered for nearly three months now. I have gone back to ASUS. Never had a problem with any of their products. I will never buy anything with the ASROCK name again.
1.0,Had to return itvI couldnt get it to connect 😰
1.0,"ive had his junk for a year and i don't recommend it. Save your money and get something worth it. It's intermittent and unreliable. I'm sitting next to the router and barely getting a consistent connection, im basically using it as a switch now."
1.0,"I bought this a couple of months ago and used it everyday until it stopped working on me a few weeks ago. Every time I would plug this into my iPhone, it would come up with a message saying that this application is not compatible with my device. On top of that, it just broke a week ago (as seen in this picture). This piece of junk is not worth your time or money. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1.0,"Eventhough, I carefully checked, it didn't fit my laptop"
1.0,"Apparently I know 2 people including myself who have received defective units and also returned it. My provider, Cox, blamed it on the modem since once they replaced it with a different modem, the service was working fine and smoothly."
1.0,Although while it worked it worked we loved it. I am very disappointed that the warranty is only for a year and a year and one week after I bought this for my son we ended up with a black screen and were unable to get the issue resolved and were offered a &#34;deal&#34; on a new one. I passed... if they don't last more than a week after the warranty without any options to fix it I will go with a different product.
1.0,I never could get this to sync and it was so cheaply manufactured it basically broke in the process.
1.0,These are awful.  Inconsistent ink flow.  Short life.  I found Cross 8518-4 to be a much better replacement.
1.0,"Have been through two of these - one within the warranty, one just past warranty.  While performance was good (albeit short range on the 5g band) - they didnot last!  Problems occur with loosing one of the two bands - intermittently - followed by a full failure.  Both these units had full UPS protection their whole short little lives so it's not a power problem. Both used in a nominal home setting (approx 10 connected devices).  Too expensive to try again.  Excellent statistical end-of-life engineering ASUS!"
1.0,"The screen is too small, the advertisements on the bottom is annoying and the overall product is not user friendly.  I am returning this product after trying it out for a week."
1.0,I haven't had this item that long and I am not able to use it.  The card corrupted and told me that it was locked and I couldn't remove anything off of it or reformat the card.  I lost everything that was on it.  Pictures music etc.
1.0,too bad this adapter did not work - we had to send it back and even had to pay the shipping for it :(
1.0,"I sent this back. I was super excited to buy this for my new iPad I got for christmas. However it was not as great as all the hype surrounding it. It worked like any other stylus I've ever had, I was hoping for more precision."
1.0,Can't get it to work. The drivers on the disk supplied don't appear to work for Windows 7 Pro. I tried the auto install and finding the driver option on the disk. I  can't locate any on the internet either.
1.0,I should have researched before I purchased.  It does not work as intended
1.0,"This is the worst computer I have ever used. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. I purchased the laptop at Frys, the Internet Explorer and WiFi didn't work so I returned it within one week. The techs there were not able to fix it and gave me a new one. The new one is also not working properly. The Internet Explorer and wifi also do not work. I contacted Frys who refused to replace it and told me to contact Acer directly. I contacted Acer requesting a refund. They refused to do so. I was on the phone for 1 hour with them, got terrible customer service and no resolution. They told me to mail in my laptop at my own expense. I am an independent contractor and need my laptop to work. I told the customer service rep this and she told me to borrow a family member's computer. This is not a solution. The end result: I have to mail in the laptop, wait for them to look at it and try to repair it. Since Frys was unable to fix the first lemon, I doubt they will be able to fix this one. I wasted $1400, not including the software I purchased for the laptop."
1.0,Battery would only charge half way- I then let it totally discharge and tried to re-charge- now it won't charge at all
1.0,"I would not recommend this computer to anyone. I purchased this computer last year and have used it for a while, and at first I liked it a lot because it was the first computer I ever had. The main problem I have with the computer is the slimness factor. Although the slimness of the computer may be a selling point, I would take into consideration that this weakens the computer structurally and has other downsides.  I took it to school and &#34;dropped&#34; it from a very low heigh and the display didn't close correctly. I can bend the display with practically no force whatsoever. The typing on this keyboard is especially odd and will take some time to get used to. Because the computer is very slim, the keys have no place to go (downwards) so they are very shallow. I had a tendency to double press the keys because there was no tactile feedback that I had pressed the key. The last major problem that I had with the computer is the fans. The computer only has 2 fans inside, one for intake, and one for exhaust. When you use your computer and the components start to heat up, the fans kick on and try to dissipate the heat. Well because there are only 2 relatively small fans inside, they have to spin at higher RPMs to get rid of the heat, which results in lots of noise. Even with one Google Chrome browser tab open (and I know that Google Chrome uses lots of system memory), the fans sounded like they were going to explode any second. I have had lots of problems with the battery! Only a few weeks after I had the computer, I had to send it to Acer for them to replace the battery because mine was not functioning. It had something to do with static electricity getting into the system. This was very frustrating because randomly the computer would shut down, sometimes in the middle of writing papers for school.<br /><br />Pros and Cons list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim Computer<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slim Computer<br />Loud fans (with only one tab open)<br />Nonfunctioning battery<br />Bad keyboard (had a tendency to double press the keys because they are very shallow)<br />Very unstable / not sturdy AT ALL (Could bend the screen with ease)<br />HIGH price point!<br /><br />In the end, I would not recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new one or an upgrade."
1.0,broke REAL quick
1.0,"I have bought this item twice now.  The first one worked great, but then broke after about 2 months.  Specifically, some of the keys stopped working...random letters.  This renders the keyboard totally useless because you just can't type anything when you're missing part of the alphabet.<br /><br />I decided to buy another one, thinking the first one was a fluke.  But, the second broke after almost the exact same amount of time, and in the exact same way!  The keys that stopped working are different, but it's definitely broken again.<br /><br />This product is NOT worth it.  If they sold it for $1, you could justify using it for a few weeks before it breaks, and then buying a new one.  But, the quality of this product is so poor that you're better off finding another brand that builds products to last.<br /><br />BTW - buyer beware - don't just go off the 5-star reviews unless it says &#34;verified purchase&#34;.  It's easy for the company to generate fake reviews of itself that are immaculate.  Everyone who has left 1-star reviews is seeing the same problem with this product.  It breaks down pretty soon after you buy it!"
1.0,"I loved my kindle until I moved and couldn't connect it to the new wifi. After several attempts at speaking with tech support over the course of the month, they sent me 3 consecutive brand new replacements, saying each time that there was a technical glitch. Each time I had to spend over an hour talking to the tech team and each time ended the same: I have to mail in the current one and get a replacement, even after the last 2 times that they assured me they would make a note and send me the most up to date model with no bugs. After they recommended sending me a replacement for the fourth time I just had to give up. I can't keep doing this."
1.0,Not compatiable with my Kindle.....
1.0,"I cannot  set it up using my browser.  Called support and got someone in China, worked with her for 30 minutes and had difficulty understanding her English.  I had to give up.  I kept getting a  404 error which means cannot find file on server.  I don't know what to do.  I will continue trying a few more times."
1.0,"DELL has gone cheap with its AC/DC plugs in the computer. i bought one of this computers and it lasts for only one day. it has burn its power supply detection chip inside the motherboard the first time i removed the power adapter. so i got a computer that now does not detect any power brick as original and refuses to charge it battery.<br /><br />Avoid Dell pcs, their power jack is crappy and may fail on you. (i have already replaced the power jack and tried with another dell power supplu and its not working so something must have burned in the motherboard.)<br /><br />Thanks for the one day computer :( Not buying DELLs again.!!!!<br /><br />Aviod this!"
1.0,"Bought this for my 7 year old son and have had nothing but problems with this Kindle AND THE REPLACEMENT that Amazon sent when the first one became a brick.  The devices constantly restart which prevents any storage clean up on the things(Which is the reason the junk restarts in the first place.  Once the memory gets to a certain capacity the device decides to call it quits).  I tried multiple times to factory reset the devices in hopes of salvaging them with no luck as it would never start the reset process.  Sure I could get to the reset menu and they would both state that they are beginning to erase the information on the devices, but after a hope filled 10 minutes they would just do a soft reset and revert back to the previous state without restoring back to factory settings.  My husband has spent hours digging through forums to a solution to this problem, but alas nothing seemed to work.  I have tried to just get another kindle of equivalent value that is not a kids edition for my son, but was told that I am stuck with the Kids edition.  After all the frustration this has put us through it has made us realize that we are now an APPLE family!"
1.0,"Product arrived DOA.  It would only operate when plugged in directly to a power source, no battery power even when indicator reflected fully charged status."
1.0,"Don't bother buying these, they will just fall off again a few weeks after you install them."
1.0,"This was a supposedly factory reconditioned router, but someone had reset the admin password and I could not get in to configure it.  TRENDnet customer service was excellent and spent an hour on the phone with me trying to get this to work.  Even hard resets had no effect.  Amazon was excellent as usual in giving me my money back and even paying for return shipping.  I generally have had great luck buying reconditioned gear through Amazon, but it is inevitable that you will get a dud sometimes.  What matters is the grace with which a recovery is done, and everyone in this case was wonderful to deal with."
1.0,"Did not want, do not need"
1.0,not what I expected
1.0,Didn't fit well. Case was not centered. Returned and went with a Speck Case.
1.0,Ordered 2 and both were defective.
1.0,Tablet broke in the case.
1.0,"The short version: As network administration major that had two of these cards to try, I can say without a doubt that this product does not perform as advertised. It does not maintain a speed that is reasonable in an environment where other devices perform just fine. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  The long version: I am majoring in Network Administration and Computer Information systems at college, so I have a few basic ideas of how to get a network up and running. I bought two of these cards for two separate computers. They work, but they are dirt slow and cannot maintain a consistent speed. I have a 50Mbps connection coming over a N900 Linkysys router that is only about 20 feet away through one wall. The fastest I can get this card to is 20Mbps at most. Usually it will drop down to 4Mbps.  I have updated the drivers, and rolled them back. I have moved my router closer. I have tried 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and dual-band. I have swapped cards out. I have adjusted antennas in every direction. I have tried no antennas. I have swapped antennas out. I even tried different PCI slots. I have tried more than any reasonable person would to get this product to perform as advertised.  This card advertised 450Mbps, but I only get 4Mbps of my 50Mbps connection. Meanwhile my generic network card,  with no antennas, in my 5 year old laptop pulls 60Mbps in the same location over the same connection. My USB dongle gets a faster connection speed, and I can at least maintain 15Mbps with it. For the record, I had two of these cards to work with so I tried both, and it is the same story with each. I also have a dozen other WiFi devices to prove without a doubt that it is not my router. This product does not perform as advertised. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  Another problem was this cards are the brackets. They were of low quality which made it hard to seat the card properly in the PCIe slot. All in all this card is garbage. Buy a USB adapter if you want a cheap network adapter. Your just wasting your money if you buy this thing. It can't pull full speeds through one wall at 20 feet, so it is worthless.  Update: Installed an ASUS PCE-AC56 card in place of the TP-Link adapter. The ASUS card was about $20 more, but I plugged it in and was pulling 60Mbps down instantly. I didn't even need to install drivers on Windows 10 to get the ASUS adapter to work."
1.0,did not work at all
1.0,"Battery was great at first, but then died. Didn't even last a month. Poor product."
1.0,horrible
1.0,"Did not last 6 months of home use; in a word..Junk.  First the little cushion &#34;feet&#34; fell off in the first month...I should have returned then as a sign of junk.  Now the case is peeling at the edges and loose.  I did not expect magic, but I did expect it to last at least a year of non-rough use."
1.0,"Product is NOT as advertised. There is no Fresco Logic FL1100 Chipset on the board as shown on my photo (blue PCB). Admittedly I purchased this card because I believed that the Card would work for my MacPro3,1 if it had a FL1100 Chipset. Indeed I later purchased an Orico PME-4U card that DOES have the FL1100 chipset (see 2nd photo - dark green PCB); and it works on my MacPro3,1 with OSX 10.10.5. Granted, the card does NOT advertise to work on a MacPro, only Windows PCs.But I knocked the card for false identification/advertising."
1.0,"The three of them stopped working in less than a month, no resistence at all."
1.0,"I absolutely love this tablet!  Very clear screen, easy to see even with my eyes, quick processor, just the right thickness and weight.  Excellent memory capacity, with or without a card.  Only problem I've had is when it lays flat, the screen wants to go black and I have to pick it back up for the screen to come back on.  It almost acts like a bad battery connection.  Otherwise, I really love it!  Update:  I've had my tablet now for 5 months and it is really starting to have some issues.  Although I've made it a point not to put much on it,  it has become very slow, apps don't want to open, when they do, it returns to lock screen on its own, touch intermittently becomes unresponsive, screen continues to go black for no reason, and it quit reading my memory card, also made by Samsung.  Really getting apprehensive about this tablet lasting any amount of time  Update:  have had this 6 months now and the issues are almost unbearable.  Touch quits very frequently throughout the day,  it freezes, still not reading my memory card, have to restart it several times a day because the screen just goes black.  Update again:  contacted Samsung for assistance with these issues.  Nothing!  Not even a we can't help you! In spite of my entire family owing Samsung phones and tablets, I  am seriously questioning ever buying Samsung ever again."
1.0,Broke right away
1.0,I bought a product and received another
1.0,"I purchased the refurbish Lynksys E2500, and it continuously drops my WiFi speed to a crawl. I have since ordered a replacement from another brand and experience no more problems with connectivity."
1.0,This battery is a piece of junk! It was made in China. My old battery was made in Korea. There's a huge difference between this battery and the one that's made in Korea.
1.0,Just image we bought this piece of junk hoping to get our monies worth. It worked for eight months and crashed!!! The warranty for this product was approxiamately 1 to 2 months. That says a lot about this product. Good luck to those people who bought this product and it went beyond eight months. Amazon labeled this product as new! The customer service label or sticker found below the laptop was tampered with. Nice one Amazon.
1.0,Very poor performance tried two units. Exchanged for the same and both fell way short of favorable. Tried a different model number from the same manufacture and was presently supprised on how well it worked.
1.0,"Sadly, for no reason it cracked.  It was not dropped, I had just finished using it and walked from the living room to my bedroom to charge it for the evening.  I saw the crack form before my eyes and thought WHAT?  this hairline crack may have happened from the colder temperature in my room, but it wasn't a crazy climate change. Regardless, it rendered it completely useless.  I can charge it and hear emails come in, but the screen no longer allows me to swipe and therefore it is useless.  I am sad that is was so poorly constructed.  I have friends and associates that have dropped tablets and phones and had the screen crack like a WEB or Puzzle and still the tablet functioned.  This is a barely noticeable line (I thought it was my hair at first) and the tablet no longer works."
1.0,"Massive headache to get it working with Comcast and thanks to deceptive description and lack of features from amazon I may be left high and dry soon.<br />Not that Comcast's mydeviceinfo page makes it easy to see but this modem is technically now &#34;End of Life&#34; on their networks, which means it &#34;might&#34; lose connection entirely soon. Now the newer TM822G model is fully supported and is actually cheaper on Amazon right now but because Amazon doesn't tell you when an updated model is available (unlike certain other better tech sites that have something to do with eggs). Out of 30 day return window so hopefully this works long enough to make the savings off the cable bill worth it."
1.0,Don't work.  I wish I could return it.
1.0,"My initial purchase worked great for a couple of weeks. Then, for no apparent reason, it would lose power and recycle through its start-up process. I requested a replacement, which came a week later, and was encouraged at first, but after an hour it stopped working again. I had it powered via USB, so I tried connecting the AC plug into the wall, but it made no difference. I reset, re-paired, replaced every cable, and never had success. It's possible it has something to do with the tuner I've attached it to, but as others have said, Netgear offers no support (the serial number is blacked out), and I don't know what else to do."
1.0,instructions for the custom text could not be found and i paid for this without receiving anything. very confusing.
1.0,Advertised as an ergonomic keyboard it is not in any way an ergonomic keyboard.  I returned it.
1.0,Piece of junk.  Save your money.  I threw mine away.
1.0,"After the first Key Power battery didn't hold a charge I emailed the company. They kindly send me a replacement battery.  My husband followed their instructions EXACTLY as Key Power had written them.  And when I say EXACTLY I mean EXACTLY- we wanted this battery to work. Sadly, this battery was worse than the first one I bought from them.  I rarely write one star reviews, but unfortunately this battery warrants it.  After a few month of having this battery my laptop now holds about 15 minutes worth of life.  My laptop now is pretty much tethered to the power cord- I should have stuck with my Apple battery and saved my $90."
1.0,"Stopped working in less than 2 years, still on warranty which covers only the hardware, so all my data lost and nobody is responsible :( I didn't expect it to die that soon so no proper backup was done. Data recovery fee is $600 and above, I just gave up and bought Sinology station with RAID, hope this will hold up better."
1.0,Didn't work on a Macbook Pro or Mac Mini. It's useless so I threw it away. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Scam
1.0,Broken sent back
1.0,charger didnot last long and not good quality.
1.0,"Now this was money not well spent. Its not even the product I was looking for. The tips does not work with my HP, even though it says it does."
1.0,"The mic on this thing is super quiet.  I have to have the input cranked all the way up in order for this to be even audible.  When I don't use the USB dongle, it mic isn't much better though the 1/8th inch jack mic input.  It's still very quiet and poor quality voice.  Shame that I wasted my money on this garbage.  Look online, and you'll see hoards of others complain about the SAME issue.<br /> And, yes, I did the firmware update from Logitech."
1.0,"Well, I really didn't want to do this but here it goes:<br /><br />I LOVE CORSAIR!!!! don't get me wrong, my PSU is Corsair (HX-850M), all my fans are Corsair (AF-120 and SP-120), my water cooler is Corsair (H100i) and my DDR3 memory is Corsair (Vengeance Pro). But they really let me down with these one.<br /><br />In my previous build i had these same fans but in red... Well, i bought a new case and said to myself ''I should try the ones with the white LED&#34; BIG MISTAKE! I ordered here and when i received them (I live in Dominican Republic btw) one of them was making an unbearable noise. Well, I contacted customer service and they sent me another pair... guess what? both of them were making the same noise. I wasn't planning on incurring in shipping/return charges so i decided to try them at a low speed and still the same noise. At the end i sold them and bought my fans locally (way more expensive but oh well).<br /><br />I don't know what happened but these white led fans disappointed me! I was expecting better, Corsair :("
1.0,CAT6 cannot be copper clad aluminum.  Increased resistance over longer runs means this will NOT support gigabit speeds.. and could degrade far faster than pure copper.  It would be different if they didn't call this CAT 6.. but they do so it gets 1 star for false advertising.
1.0,It's nice. But the camera is only for selfies.<br />Which is my fault as I didn't read all the info. So I use it for books and my iPad for everything else
1.0,Warning: seller Nanning 1000 power  selling fake memory card.
1.0,this tablet sucks. the screen is blurry and it cuts off in the middle of application its horrible and i hate that i spent any money on it. I would only accept it if it where a gift. it has even been a month and i already had to take it to repair shop because it will not come on.
1.0,Trying to use it with Powerpoint or Keynote on a MacBook.  Pairs easily but only key that does anything (move to next item in presentation) is the tiny return key.  Website says it works with Keynote but no information on how to get it to do so in any useful way.
1.0,They sent me a completely different tablet this one was way better in my opinion but it is what it is.
1.0,This item did not meet my needs.  My IPAD has a protective case because school aged children handle it.  It would not fit in this case with the protective case on it.  The case was not large enough to meet my needs.  It appeared to be a nice product and a co-worker was happy to have it for her IPAD that is not in a protective case.
1.0,I am very disappointed with my purchase!  I love the RooCase I bought for my Kindle 7 HDX!  Not so for this Apple Air case.  Magnets will not hold in either of the stand positions!  I can barely tell there are magnets where they are supposed to be!  I will need to send back!  Cannot recommend this case!
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product. I worked the first few times I used it, then it kept skipping as it read the discs. After maybe 20 uses, it won't even read discs at all now."
1.0,complete piece of crap. Mine is frozen completely. It's a brick. I would never buy an acer again.
1.0,It did not work!
1.0,Left control key sticks. Bought a little over a month ago and have barely used because of the problem. Been very busy with a new job and haven't had a chance to return and was unfamiliar with returns as I've only returned one item to Amazon in over a decade. Now can't return it and I'm stuck with a keyboard that doesn't work. I'm a programmer. I NEED the CTRL key to work.
1.0,"less than one week, the &#34;r&#34; on the keyboard and the space-bar is already stuck"
1.0,"not the sellers fault, but the only thing magnetic about this cover is that when you use it in the lower stand mode there is a magnet in the back of the cover that holds the cover in place, of course this is when you least need it.  When using the Higher stand mode, there is nothing to keep anything in place.  Poor design my Samsung.  I returned it and replaced it with the MoKo cover.  Much more functional"
1.0,"This was my second replacement of this computer, both arrived with a defect.  Totally disappointed and have purchased a Dell from Dell.com"
1.0,I bought 2 at the same time and within 2 weeks both had stopped working. On the keyboards. On the first one the bottom row of keys stopped working and on the second one the middle set of keys stopped working.
1.0,"Did not work for me, instructions not clear either"
1.0,"This item stopped working once it ran out battery, won't charge"
1.0,Does not write discs
1.0,You know what Amazon block my first review even though there is nothing wrong with my review but they blocked it because I said I would not buy refurbished would buy brand new instead. You know I have never write a bad review for Amazon but misleading public about for the products you backed for will result a law suit in your behalf. Continue in this path you will lose a long time customer. That is all I have to say.
1.0,The switch only lasted about 14 months and now it wont display the correct colors on the screen. One ports bad I think because its push button contacts.
1.0,Skips all over and can't control mouse-Returned
1.0,Junk.
1.0,lasted 2 weeks...
1.0,All three cables failed within the 1st month.  Emailed vendor with no reply back.
1.0,I returned this item because it made very loud noise and will not burn CD.
1.0,"The charging piece that goes into the tablet never fit, it was always very loose and we would have to manipulate it just to get it to charge. From having to do this all the time, about 3 weeks after getting the charger the adapter piece snapped and is no longer usable."
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,"I guess the saying is true. You get what you pay for. Ordered this in April 2015 and it is now August 31, 2015 and it no longer works. Thats how far 17.98 got me, 4 months worth of usage. No wonder why the original costs so much because it last long. Save your money and by the original, its not worth paying 17.98 for 4 months of usage, which equates to $4.50 a month........ It's not worth buying especially knowing you will need to buy another one in 4 months."
1.0,It died in less than two years.
1.0,"Not only do this only last a few months, but the warranty is only 30 days so my daughter is SOL. And if you go to the iBenzer website for any contact info, there isn't any. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,wrong size
1.0,The only thing it could do without crashing is unlocking it. That's the best it could do. Do not buy its the worst tablet ever. Just pay for a nexus7 for 50 bucks more. Do not buy
1.0,USB ports stopped working after a few weeks...
1.0,"Rip off, do not buy this!"
1.0,the case i got was broken in the corner
1.0,No windows 10 compatibility. Lack of response from Dell.
1.0,"Avoid this device for now - it's not a finished product.  Tried to install and the Lima was not detected on the main local network. After switching to a different network entirely, the device was detected and made a system update.  Support site is a circular process of moving between two pages that repeat the same information (turn it off and on again, check if you have internet). Rinse and repeat. I did get real human support at one point, but they only repeated the information already shown on the website.  There's no status light on the device so it's hard to tell if it's alive and working properly which is a very poor design decision. You'd think that a light that came on to show power or readiness would be straightforward to include on a device costing $150.  After running for 20 minutes the Lima is quite warm, perhaps even a little hot. I don't know how well it will last with continuous use as a passively cooled device, though after leaving on for a day it did not get any hotter.  Of note is that during the installation process, you are given the chance to add mobile devices, but if you skip this, there is no obvious way to add them later from within the Lima software. You need to go to their website to find the address in order to download the app onto your phone, plus you need to install some third party crash reporting application in order to use the beta app. Also pay attention to the default settings on the phone app - on Android they default to using Wifi + Data to synchronize everything, so if you are on a limited data plan and don't check the settings fully, you could find yourself going over your monthly limit.  If you don't have administrator access to your router, there are two possibilities:  1. Your Lima won't be connected - see the problem I encountered above.  2. You won't be able to set up any port forwarding for the Lima. This means your data will pass through their servers encrypted; as there is no security audit yet on what they do, I guessyou have to take their word for what's going on for encryption. I also don't know what this would mean long term if they decided to turn their servers off or they change business models - maybe you'd need a subscription to keep going when they realize that they need to keep selling devices to keep the servers on. The whole thing is not so clearly explained, and it feels less like you own the device, rather that you have it on loan while they exist.  On the local network transfer speeds look decent, though not fantastic; the real test will be from a remote location.  ***Update*** Depending on what your remote location is, you may not have access to the Lima. I tried in a corporate managed network environment and could not access my Lima; enable tethering on my phone and connect to the tethered network and the Lima pops up. Depending on how you plan to use your Lima, you may not be able to connect to it from all locations - keep this in mind before you buy it as you may not be able to access from a remote location.  For $150 it's not worth it - keep in mind you need to bring your own storage to the table in order to use the Lima, and once the drive is in use on the Lima, you can't unplug it and move the storage to another location and access the same files.  If they continue to add features and capabilities in the future, then it could reach the promised potential, but at the moment you are buying a promise of future functionality rather than a fully realized product that's ready to go."
1.0,"UPDATE: This keyboard is awful. Do not buy it. After owning this for about a month it started acting up, random keys would spit out when I would try to type one letter, other keys stopped working. The company replaced it, worked fine for a while and then the same thing happened a few weeks later. Suggestions from the company did not work. I have found other reviews on opposite colors of this keyboard citing the same problem, which I wish I saw sooner. I don't know what causes the issues with this keyboard but please, save yourself the stress and don't buy this.  Old review: I bought this keyboard to replace my Apple wireless one. I have to say that I am pretty happy with it. It types the same way noise-wise, feels the same as best as I can tell, has decent range, and it's a really beautiful color as well. I only had some minor issues with it, such as sometimes it would seem to stop working for a few seconds, and that it can be hard to tell with the indicator light if it is powered well enough. However I have not had these problems lately, I'm not sure if that was from playing around with the batteries or if it was the keyboard itself. Overall, it is an excellent and cost effective keyboard. I would recommend it to any fan of the Apple wireless."
1.0,Very poor
1.0,Did not fit my lap top as described. Seller did refund my money very quickly.
1.0,"Battery dies very fast. Screen display not as clear as expected. Only lasted a month and a half, screen went completely blank."
1.0,I hated it. I sent this thing right back I couldn't get the apps I wanted an its very slow
1.0,"I mean, the fan kind of really sucks. I don't mean to rag on it so hard cuz I didn't pay a whole lot for it but it's fairly noisy, it came partially broken with the plastic bits misaligned too. Scented beads are alright, they don't particularly smell very good nor do they smell much at all most of the time. The fan is waaaaaay too weak for Texas heat so if you want a summer fan where temps are near 100 this fan isn't worth the money even in an enclosed central ac'd building. I guess maybe I should try the ice thing and hopefully it'll make it better but for the most part I wouldn't recommened this item. Also, it really needs to be connected to an outlet or computer or it isn't even worth having on at all, if it's purely battery powered it barely even makes any air at all."
1.0,What a piece of crap.  Constantly dropping connections.
1.0,"I bought the 1 TB SSD and the Startech USB 3.0 to SATA cable. I am using Windows 10.  The drive was not recognized. I also tried an Apricorn EZ upgrade case. My 256 GB SSD would still not clone to the Samsung Pro drive. Kept getting a message from Samsung Data Migration software  that the drive was removed.<br /><br />Stay away from this drive if you have Windows 10.<br /><br />There may some issues with the Dell 8500 Sata implementation, but I still think the Samsung drive and Windows 10 do not get along."
1.0,THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR WILL NOT FIT!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
1.0,"Horrible piece of junk!! Only used once and it failed disastrously! Just quit working, no indicator light, nothing. Same thing happened with a PNY 128GB &#34;Turbo&#34;. These were for my desktop computer; never carried anywhere, never exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. I own, or have owned dozens of flash drives, by many of the leading makers and these PNY's are the only ones to have just plain failed. Stay away from PNY!"
1.0,"While I don't like to give anything less than a positive review, I have to be honest and look out for fellow consumers. The controller I ordered simply did not work for me. No matter what I did. And, the disc didn't work either. I don't know how much more I can say. I had to send it back and I'm grateful to Amazon.com for a stress-free refund."
1.0,"I was impressed when I received, speed is no issue. I used few times in a week and turn off. After 2 weeks I let run and when I push the small button at the back, indication light start flashing and wont start up. PSU adapter works good. very disappointed the outcome of this device."
1.0,By that I mean the quality control is crap. Mine was dead on arrival.
1.0,this is for PC's only!!!! will not work with xBox or other gaming devices. This is not a &#34;gaming&#34; headphone ... its just a headphone
1.0,"cable i got was actually not flat. so, cool mispost, or poorly sent product.<br /><br />the cable i did get, while cat6 is round. and uh, not that i really care to split hairs, i wanted the flat cable so i could hard-wire in something and not have it stick up out of my carpet.<br /><br />but, it's cool. thanks for that."
1.0,"Horrible piece of junk!! Only used twice and it failed disastrously! Just quit working, no indicator light, nothing. Same thing happened with a PNY 32GB &#34;Attache&#34;. These were for my desktop computer; never carried anywhere, never exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. I own, or have owned dozens of flash drives, by many of the leading makers and these PNY's are the only ones to have just plain failed. Stay away from PNY!"
1.0,installed the board now computer starts then shuts down
1.0,The pictured/described unit is not what I received.  The picture and description are for a generation 2 device and I received a generation 1 device.
1.0,"The router I had previously lasted for 7 years. This router lasted for four months.<br /><br />It worked fine initially, although the range was not fantastic. I occasionally had signal issues on the second floor of our house. Then, it just stopped working. I contacted customer service to see about getting a replacement router and was told I would be contacted within one business day with information on how to get a new router. Great, right? Nothing. My emails were met with excuses like &#34;the team wasn't here yesterday&#34; and being cc'd on a note to the &#34;team&#34; saying &#34;please expedite this the customer is inconvenienced by not having internet at home.&#34; Because of the poor quality of the router and he terrible customer service, I would definitely stay away from any TP-Link products."
1.0,Worked for one day and then the flash  drive corrupts your files and you can't  recover them. Highly recommended  you DON'T  BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,"Difficult to use.  Not very protective fell from seat while getting out of the car and my kindle was destroyed, lens shattered.  My original origami case from Amazon is much easier to use and the protection is much better I will not purchase another roo case."
1.0,"Not made well, put a little more money out for something that will lat!"
1.0,To slow
1.0,The screen cover made it difficult to text.
1.0,"This case is not a good fit for the Lenovo Tab A8-50, it is difficult to get to to the charger because of the open areas on the tablet.  The case does not have a sturdy fit, it is to loose not sure if this case was made for the Lenovo Tab A8-50"
1.0,Buttons already broke and it jumps and freezes doesn't work for gaming.
1.0,Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging or I'd be returning it. Camera and home button don't line up. Doesn't &#34;stand&#34; right. Pretty worthless. Don't bother.
1.0,"my  keyboard has two keys that are exactly the same, it is missing the light up key."
1.0,"These are only good because its a pack of different lengths.  BUT BEWARE...they stop working after a couple months.  I constantly have to unplug and re-plug or turn the plug over just to get them to work, which kind defeats the purpose of the new lightning cable where you don't have to care which side is up it should work either way.  It is a good product if you only need it for a couple months."
1.0,This case did not fit my Ipad Air 2 and I needed a new case and now I have to start all over again!!!!! This is such a inconvenience for me!!
1.0,"This keyboard worked for a total of 1 minute. I received the keyboard and installed the 2 AA batteries and I was able to pair to both my MacBook and PC without a problem. Then after it went into sleep mode, which is after 30 seconds, I couldn't wake it and therefore had to turn it off and on again and re-pair it with both devices. I never got to re-pair it because it would no longer stay awake past the 30 seconds to get re-paired to the same computers. I don't even think I had it working long enough to type 1 sentence. I had to go to the local big box to buy a regular old corded keyboard until I find a decent cross-platform keyboard."
1.0,Fell apart after about 1 month :(
1.0,Micro USB Hub fell apart immediately when used for the first time
1.0,"These did not fit my Dell Inspiron 11. Although the description mentions it to be compatible with Inspiron 11 - the charger plug is way too large.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon's easy return policy, I was able to return it and get a full refund."
1.0,"Worse router I've used. Almost traded in my linksys for their rebate thing and I'm glad I didnt.<br /><br />The setup was easy very very simple and it's fast but then exactly 24 hours later none of my devices would connect, over wifi that is. A quick reboot fixed the problem but do you really want to reboot your router everyday!?<br /><br />My old router is still good and I wanted to replace it to have a better range. Maybe they can fix the issue with a software update because everything else was perfect especially the range."
1.0,I Hate This graphic tablet it doesn't even work for that I hate this with All my hate Don't buy this forever
1.0,"I PURCHASED THE PC MUSIC SPEAKERS & SYSTEM ON 5/12/15 TO MY DISMAY,ON 8/30/15 THE POWER PACK  SHORTED OUT. THIS IS VERY TROUBLING DUE TO THE FACT I CONTACTED THE MFG. CO. AND PRAISED THE PRODUCT. I'M ASKING FOR A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM (same) IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ONE I HAVE.  I had an issue with my pc speaker system. Arion Legacy quickly amended the issue. The co. is very proficient...Thank You."
1.0,"Broke after a year. My original iPhone charger still works, and is 2 years old."
1.0,These are the slowest thumb drives I have ever used!  Terrible!
1.0,I have an ASUS F550L and the power cord is an ADP-45BW B.  This item says it is a replacement for it.  I don't think so.  Does it provide power to the laptop and charge the battery?  Yes.  But as soon as I plug it in and try and use the mouse pad it is not usable at all.  The mouse pointer will jump all over the place and when click whenever and everywhere.  Did a search on the web as I thought it was the computer and found that others had issues with 3rd party cords as well.  So this will need to be shipped back.
1.0,"I have not had to file a claim on the warranty that came with my washer-dryer units (well, it didn't come with them, I bought the extended warranties). The booklet that came with my policy noticed spoke of replacing the unit(s) &#34;free of charge&#34; on multiple occasions, but the actual warranty document states that the maximum coverage is the original cost of the item. Therefore, if they spend money on a repair, and then the unit dies a year later, I will receive what I paid for the unit minus the cost of the repair they paid for -- and two years later the model(s) I bought may no longer be available and what is available may be more expensive. So, there is no &#34;replacement at no charge.&#34; This is blatant dishonesty and I'm going to insist on getting the price of the extended warranties back from the appliance dealer. I am incredulous that in California, this kind of bait-and-switch tactic is allowed."
1.0,"Initially the case looked good and my tablet fit, but the tablet would not work properly. Only time the tablet would work is if I started to remove tablet from case, like the light sensor was being covered. I checked and the sensor was not covered. I even enlarged the notch for the sensor but the tablet would go dark when installed completely in the case. As I slid the tablet partially out, the tablet would go bright again. A total waste of money and time."
1.0,Problems one month in
1.0,"big, heavy and uncomfortable to hold! btw, the design is sooooo ugly!"
1.0,Not very good.
1.0,Right after I moved all my information onto this it became corrupted and demands to be formatted. Wow.
1.0,"While it is stylish, it's not comfortable.  The mouse is very selective about which surfaces are under it.  It constantly drops connection with the receiver and after a while, it completely shuts off. Stay away from this mouse.<br /><br />UPDATE - I requested to return the mouse 33 days after I received it.  The seller responded: &#34;Thank you for contacting HDE. Unfortunately we only allow returns within 30 days of the delivery date. Your order is beyond that time frame and we are unable to process an RMA.&#34;.  So, if you want a mouse with a 30 day warranty...buy it!"
1.0,These was a horrible product. It would not allow me to download or save information on it. I would not recommend it.
1.0,These cords worked for about a week. Now they only work some of the time. Very unreliable. They only charge when the cord is bent a certain way and will just stop charging at any time.
1.0,"This was a waste of my money, it didn't fit.  It was for my daughters school issued computer.  I purchased one last year and it fit just fine.... If you have a chormebook don't buy this item, you'll be sorry.  Because the school was late in issuing the computers, I missed the return deadline, $20 wasted...."
1.0,Horrible! Battery was defective right out of the box. It cost me money (the return) simply ordering this item. Never again
1.0,Product (both) failed after about 1 month of use. Actually one failed after about a week of use.
1.0,"The monitor is not Dell, not like expected!!!<br />All other parts was like expected. Computer works good but slow. (Need upgrade)"
1.0,I was hoping this would be awesome and it had potential but wound up being a goat rodeo.  When I got my FIRST one (yes I wound up getting two) it was missing the &#34;F1&#34; key.  Not a big deal since I never use it but when I called Acer they couldn't just send me the key. They had to replace the whole thing.  I never got a chance to use that one. I got a replacement about a week later and it wouldn't boot properly or load webpages.  It crashed and then wouldn't reboot and I just gave up....got an HP laptop instead
1.0,"I only gave it one star because I can't give it 0. The only keys that worked with the computer were tab and enter. Absolute crap, so I returned it.  Don't waste your time or money"
1.0,"Very unhappy with this card.  I used it to shoot pictures of my husband driving the &#34;8 laps at Daytona&#34; drive.....  Looked at the photos on the card in the camera, they were all there and they were great pictures!  I went to download it to my computer and the picture card crashed, I lost all of the photos!  Not at all happy with the card, but my IT department saved the day and they were able to recover the photos!  So, a once in a lifetime experience was lost and then found!  But, if I hadn't known someone I would have lost those memories forever!"
1.0,"Poor quality, very thin wire to USB, ordered 11 and ALL broke off."
1.0,Did not fit my Kindle Fire HD 7 as ordered....sooooo sad!  Can not use
1.0,"i bought the belkin keyboard because i use my ipad air for work - taking notes during meetings or during the day. so i was looking for something that was simple to use, connected easily and seamlessly to my ipad air and allowed me to work smoothly.<br />this keyboard does none of the above. the connection process is complicated and unclear. it disconnects quickly and suddenly - and to re-connect i often have to use several different steps (in varying sequences)in the middle of taking notes or writing an email. the instructions are short and unclear and you get virtually no help from their email help group - i sent a few emails out that were unanswered - surprising given how much this keyboard costs. it is definitely not worth the price."
1.0,Purchased (1) modem on 7/31 ...and they sent two (2).  Did not work as advertised nor was it compatible as promised with Comcast systems.  Returned both modems immediately and have received no credit!  How could this be construed as good???
1.0,"This armband is AWFUL and grossly insufficient. I purchased May 2015 and halfway through August 2015 the velcro hooks do not &#34;stick&#34; anymore. Upon closer inspection I realized that some of the hooks have just ripped off from me taking the armband off after working out. If you need something cheap for a weekend hiking trip or plan to keep it on your arm without removing it this product is PERFECT. Else, I strongly suggest spending a little more for better quality...my lesson fully learned!"
1.0,The clip used to mount on laptop came apart when  trying to mount to laptop the first time.
1.0,Couldn't get it to work following instructions to the tee.
1.0,O.K
1.0,missing usb adaptor..box messed up..sent back...
1.0,"the case is a standard slim case as advertised, but the cable is not a standard usb 3.0 cable.  both ends are the same, meaning they're both the side that plugs into the computer, AND it's very inflexible.  i could not get it to work on my usb 3.0 port on my laptop, i had to use my 2.0 port which totally defeats the purpose of 3.0!!!  don't get this..."
1.0,Not the quality I expected.
1.0,"I have had this drive for just over a year and it has started to give me issues. On two occasions recently I have found my laptop with a black screen that simply says no boot device detected. Upon checking the bios, there is no drive listed. I have taken the drive out and re-seated it and managed to get the laptop working again but obviously there is a problem and I fear that it will fail completely soon. I can't return to Amazon at this point and I'm waiting to hear back from Crucial although I'm not hopeful. It worked great for a year but a SSD should last a lot longer than that. Not happy at all."
1.0,Worked for 1 week before the EU adapter stopped working
1.0,"I have a current generation Kindle and this case does not fit, and the magnet does not work. Not a good product."
1.0,Bought to use with my PS3. Save your money and get something that's meant for the task. My PS3 sees the headset but the headset isn't receiving. Tested with my Samsung Note 4 and the same thing happens.
1.0,"Just received this hp.  They brag on easy update to free Windows 10.  Right.  Started the update.  &#34;It stated collecting files&#34; for 2 or more hours then screen popped up, &#34;unable to update windows 10&#34;.  That was my first experience with it.  Had to take it to Staples.  They are doing it for me and checking any flaws.  Great company that Staples.  Will offer more on this when I get it back.  So far not impressed."
1.0,Always get a busy signal.  Was forced to purchase another device for hot spot
1.0,"It is made from cheap material, it broke within weeks."
1.0,This honestly is not worth buying. It doesnt snap onto the computer well at all and breaks way too easy.
1.0,"When I started pounding it with the stapler I knew we had a serious problem...<br />After the return period expired it started scrolling down the page in several leaps, so that I had to wait until it reached the bottom and then scroll it up to the top again, wait again while it slowly scrolled itself to the bottom again in small leaps, scroll it back to the top again, wait again while it slowly scrolled itself to the bottom again in small leaps, scroll it back to the top again, wait again while it slowly scrolled itself to the bottom again in small leaps, scroll it back to the top again, wait again while it slowly scrolled itself to the bottom again in small leaps, scroll it back to the top again...<br />  Finally. after repeating this 10-15 times (but sparing you, gentle reader, from reading all the iterations), and finding this to be an ongoing problem, I began to doubt my capabilities with a mouse and posted an Amazon question. Other people have had the same problem, and I missed those reviews. So if you find my review please take it seriously and DO NOT BUY if you don't want to risk damaging a perfectly good stapler on a nasty mouse."
1.0,"Don't waste your money!!! This is toted as a gaming keyboard, 2 weeks after using the product the keys are sticking, and no I didn't spill anything on it. I got this for free, so I didn't waste any money. Will not purchase any products from this manufacturer.. I am going back to Razer."
1.0,It's a cute case but breaks and cracks easily
1.0,The only reason I ordered this was to download books from my public library that uses 3 M Cloud app.<br />Guess what....kindle does not support that app and after talking with 2 very nice people at Kindle support I returned it.
1.0,It was torn up in the package...
1.0,"Let's start off with the one plus. Yes this keyboard can be washed. I've washed it in a dishwasher and I've submerged it completely in a sanitizing solution and it worked afterwards. That's the only positive thing I have to say about these keyboards though.<br /><br />This product is the Supreme poster child for terrible design. I think the people who designed this never once sat down and actually used their product.<br /><br />Where to start... the Home button is right next to the backspace button, so if you're used to a regular US keyboard layout then you're going to spend a lot of frustrating time getting used to the new layout, as the cursor moves where you don't want it to be and you erase perfectly good text. As if that weren't enough, they located the right trackpad button right where the heel of your right hand is when you use a natural hand position for typing. So if you use the \\""built in hand rest feature\\"", your right hand will push the button and your cursor will move to wherever you have it pointed to, which is almost invariably not where you want to be typing. The trackpad itself is too small for any real use and you'll find yourself begging the heavens for a mouse.<br /><br />And then there's the sticking keys. Out of the four keyboards that we tested, two of them have keys that stick down. One has a problem with the F1 button and another has a problem with the 4 key. Not only is it badly designed, it's also very badly made and I don't expect they would last very long under normal use. Not that I could bring myself to use one long enough to find out; its ability to resist the sudden deceleration of hitting a wall, or its ability to wistand the weight of a Freightliner truck, would get tested long before I ever washed it enough times to find out if it can withstand repeated washings.<br /><br />popped back up. See what i mean? Just for the record this sentence ws typed usimng the keyboard in question. The key spacing is all rong, and the comma key juststuck in the down position,, and now it [<br /><br />Maybe... MAYBE... if you work in the medical industry and type by pecking at the keys with two fingers... this might be worth your time and money... But if you're entertaining the idea of this as a work tool, one that has even the remotest link to the concept of productivity, you would do yourself and your company a great disservice by spending money on one of these."
1.0,"I have purchased two of these cover/keyboards and both of them have broken at the hinge! Beware! They do not last as advertised and the company ignores attempts to make it right.  HAVIT claims a full 1 year warrantee but does not honor the claim.  I attempted to contact them and have never received a response.  Tried them twice, never again."
1.0,"Photo is deceiving, this case will not allow for the ipad to stand up...the case is too flimsy...I threw it away."
1.0,It's very nice except my screen gets markedly darker inside the case.  Normally it's bright & easy to see.  I'm disappointed.
1.0,Motherboard HDMI video which is integrated on the motherboard failed within 2 years.
1.0,It's bad
1.0,"The product is flawless. The software updates are not. They took over an hour to install and update. My on screen keyboard is UNUSABLE it's so slow. A hard reset fixed it today, for the time being. I've heard one or two say that it went back to being slow after a few days. Time will tell.<br /><br />Hold down the power button for 15 seconds or so, until it shuts down. Do not hit anything on the screen when it asks you if you want to power down. Just hold down the power button until it shuts off. Wait 20 seconds before turning it back on. If it helps you, find this post useful. This needs more attention.<br /><br />The product itself is worth five stars but if the new software update makes the keyboard useless, then you can barely use your kindle the way it's meant to be used and that's a big deal. Even a brand new car with a shot out motor is only worth a few hundred bucks. I wanted to rate this higher, but I can't.<br /><br />Please fix this! Swype and keyboard functions are ESSENTIAL.<br /><br />EDIT: it's slow again today, I had to repeat the process."
1.0,Kept disconnecting from the computer every 5 seconds no matter what was plugged in. Easy way to destroy a flash drive or SD card.
1.0,The power button broke off easy!
1.0,From what I've noticed the shield is a little to big or maybe it's suppose to be. I had to cut mine to fit..
1.0,cuts out all the time
1.0,don't fix me!
1.0,"Similar to other critical posts I cannot get get this device to work in WISP mode with hotel wifi that presents a login page.  It seems to connect, but after browsing one or two pages (passed through excruciatingly slow) then every page after that redirects to the 192.168.8.1 setup page.  Forcing a 60 sec+ reboot at nearly each config change is unacceptable,  I'm disappointed because the form factor, minus the quality issues cited in other reviews, is great and I was looking forward to using this to be a single connectivity point for all devices while traveling.  I'll be returning this and looking into other gear noted in these reviews.  No point trying the wired access as I need both as advertised."
1.0,Too big for my laptop
1.0,This arrived and it was smaller than I thought it would be - okay I can deal with that.  Then I used it and I actually really liked hot it felt on my wrist.  Then two days later the silicon junk started leaking out the bottom.  Clearly the top was not glued down properly.  What a piece of junk!  Do not buy this mouse pad you will regret it.
1.0,"This item is made so shabbily. On two of them, the plastic piece on top separated from the wire and the third said it &#34; this accessory may not be supported.  We bought it for an Iphone 5S.  Too bad."
1.0,Battery did not work with the Dell PC. Inserted battery and PC identify battery as not an authorized Dell battery. Purchased a battery from Dell inserted battery PC identified battery as a valid Dell battery. No issues. The amazon battery was probably a knock off fraud product.
1.0,"it did not work, I try charging for hours and nothing, and it is more expensive to send it back."
1.0,"It was quite difficult to get on or off and one corner broke off after a couple days of light use. (Light use meaning moving the laptop from one desk/table to another a few times.) I really doubt the case would have offered much protection if I had dropped the laptop, so this one is going in the trash."
1.0,It had problems 2 weeks in. There is a crackle noise in the left ear. I've stopped using it since.
1.0,I hated this cable the minute I pulled it from the package. It is much thicker than shown in the images and after re-reading the negative reviews I really regretted making this purchase. looks like this sucker heats up too much and melts/sparks when used.<br /><br />I tend to leave my cables plugged in and this would have been scary had I had that happen to me!<br /><br />Thank goodness Amazon is easy to deal with when it comes to returns.<br /><br />Be sure to check out all the reviews not just the good ones (take a look at some of the photos) before you buy.
1.0,"It doesn't even plug, like the conector isn't the right size"
1.0,It would boot up but do nothing after that. We could not use it. We sent it back
1.0,Product not what I expected. Better options for similar pricing. For under $15 ($10-$15) to be exact I would get smart/intelligent 6 USB port chargers.
1.0,"Got these three weeks after I ordered it.  The description says 100 pcs, but all I got was 58 pcs!  Cheap product too.<br />Never again!!!"
1.0,This is junk and I will never buy it again.
1.0,"The charger cord separated from the adapter and ripped in half, exposing the copper wiring. It let off a giant spark accompanied with smoke and blew out the power in my dorm room. I could've have been electrocuted or easily started a fire. I only had the charger for about 2 months before it ripped in half."
1.0,"Very disappointed in product. Cracked when put on, but since after return date could not return."
1.0,terible router. Bought it as a replacement for a great dlink I had for the last 4 years. This thing is terrible. Can't even stream a video consistently. That's what I get for trying to save some cash buying a referbished model. But seems like even the new (non referbished) stink. But hey it's a cylinder. How novel :-/
1.0,I dont like it bad quality
1.0,"Worked for a couple of days just like the first one I purchased from this seller. The screen is overly sensitive, causing the tablet operate on its own without touching it. Unfortunately, it's totally useless after two attempts at installing two different screens. Waste of time and money."
1.0,Did not work
1.0,"Update.<br />I contacted livescribe about their crappy product, continuously dropping the connection, *Galaxy 2 device, they told me the problem was possibly my outdated device, GUESS WHAT I GOT A NEW DEVICE, and the connection is still rubbish.<br /><br />THIS PEN BLOWS<br />It keeps dropping the link, and livescribe, support is total garbage.<br />I've been wanting one of these pens for years, now that I've finally gotten one, I'm very disappointed, this pen only works with one of my three smart devices and unfortunately for me its the device with the least amount of memory.<br />It does not work with my ipad 2 which i use for work, it does not work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 which i use for school.<br />It only works with my phone, which has very limited local memory, and I cannot save anything livescribe related to the expandable memory.<br />So, now I have to purchase a tablet device that i will be compatible with or just be stuck with a very expensive pen."
1.0,it sucks..splided
1.0,"too loud, replaced it with another one and it is still loud"
1.0,Adapter didn't  work properly .  I thought I had ordered  a charger seems it was only a wall adapter.
1.0,Does not work!!!
1.0,i was tolded it would work with my cell phone hot spot and it did not. returned not happy.
1.0,Write cache module failed shortly after install.
1.0,"When I first got this router it worked flawlessly. It has been three months and now the wireless connection is the most frustrating connection I've dealt with in my life. If I restart the router it works fine for about five minutes, and after that it regularly pings greater than 500ms locally. It is not a connection issue by my devices as several devices in my home all have horrible ping to this router. inSSIDer shows that the signal is strong and isn't dropping so it must be something with the actual routing and not the wireless connection itself.<br /><br />It makes basic wireless internet browsing a horrendous experience, let alone online gaming which is half of what I purchased this router for."
1.0,Didn't sit right on iPad hard to push buttons
1.0,"It only charges my laptop, but cannot transfer data.  I bought it for that purpose. I was so excited to get this in the mail... but disappointed now."
1.0,This did not work. It was returned as it was entirely useless to us.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!  FAKE!!! FAKE!!!!! FAKE!!!!!!  Does NOT come with &#34;hologram&#34; sticker on back, does NOT have bar code on back of chipboard. Chipboard is GREEN!!!!  Real chipboard is TEAL,&#34;blue-green&#34; Before you buy, watch ANY YouTube video on comparison. EVERYTHING that's said about the COUNTERFEIT CHIP, THAT'S WHAT I WAS SOLD!!!!!  Don't get me wrong, it might work. bit NOT ALFA..."
1.0,Magnet to close to computer
1.0,"Plugged in worked fine was able to use a mice or external hard drive, but broke on the second use,<br />look for a party manufactered product.."
1.0,Non-Functional.
1.0,Stopped working after a month.
1.0,it doesnt seem to work. only works every once in awhile
1.0,"Dust cover was tiny, not disclosed in the description. The dust cover could not fit a tower CPU. Instead it looked like it would fit those old outdated CPUs used in the 90s. I do not recommend this item. It's misrepresented!"
1.0,They don't charge as fast as the Apple product and you have to plug them in one way (not both sides). You get what you pay for...
1.0,No software was on the device
1.0,I don't not recommend this product for any age.
1.0,"Great looking case and it fit the iPad perfectly.  However, almost immediately one corner started peeling.  2 months later the whole entire back covering has peeled off.  Would love to contact the seller but cannot find contact information."
1.0,too slippery
1.0,Came apart after two weeks!
1.0,Waste of your money. It looks good but so thing it broke without me hitting it or anything. Will not be able to protect your computer at all.
1.0,Did not function properly for me. Instructions that came with product were minimal and useless.
1.0,impossible to fix and charger breaks quickly// I reaaly liked this alot but the charger broke quickly and also the port. Brought it in to be repaired and the repair was more costly than the tablet & they advised me to toss it// only one charging port so I am out of luck//such a shame that a nice item like this lasts such a short time// spend more and get something you wont have to throw out. Not Happy!
1.0,This product did NOT work... returned for a USB microphone.
1.0,I purchased two cords about 3 weeks ago you both have broken poorly constructed
1.0,Did not work
1.0,Got my daughter this tablet for her birthday and she was super excited.  After 4 months it wouldn't charge anymore.  I contacted Pioneer about getting it fixed/replaced under warranty.  They asked for all the information I sent already so I resent it.  They asked for it again.  I resent it.  They continued to do this until we hit the 12 month mark.  I literally emailed them the information almost daily but they said they didn't have it all.  I will NOT purchase ANYTHING from Pioneer again.
1.0,"Not a good experience at all, We only had the Tablet approximately 4 weeks and it has had so many issues 1. Charger port would charge sparingly and now it does not work at all, get me once shame on you get me twice shame on me, there won't be a second time that's for sure."
1.0,The screen protector is awful and it is broken when I open it. I want to ask for a refund !!!
1.0,Insane imput lag
1.0,Was not for the iPad2! I purchased the Apple iPad Air 2 MGTX2LL/A and it was too big for it.
1.0,Torn apart in less than a week.
1.0,Never worked.
1.0,Swivel broke after a month. Can't use. It was very functional before that happened.
1.0,The unit came with NO directions of use of any kind.  Don't know how to use it.  Guess I will have to buy a kindle.
1.0,"Contrary to the description, this does NOT fit a Toshiba L750 Satellite laptop."
1.0,Very sad the mouse pad has a mind of its own since day one. I had a different keyboard that looks similar and actually cheaper which worked fine. This one is disappointing.
1.0,"Holes don't align properly.  When I tried to get the holes to align as closely as I could, the film ended-up overlapping the edge of the tablet so that it wouldn't seal. I tossed both pieces of film.  I will buy something else."
1.0,My iPhone 6 constantly complains about this not being an original accessory. This hasn't happened even with other cheap cables.
1.0,Does not fit Fire HD 7! The cutout for camera & side volume controls does not line up.
1.0,One of my cordes for the avi was cut when i recived it appears to be by a knife or something similiar. The screen is also bad in some areas of the screen like the lower right coner messing with the colors. Do not buy a waste of money
1.0,"Mike stopped working within a week of use, right earphone followed in about 4-5 days. Its been used maybe 7-9 hours a week since its been purchased. Shouldve looked at the reviews more thoroughly.  Will try to get an RMA but sitting in Canada having to ship it back is on me and any reliable shipping of this is going to cost atleast 30 dollars + and not even sure about customs and taxes. Couldve gotten something solid for way less.<br /><br />Do not buy it. Im sure if it works for you its great but its not worth investing in considering how many of these lose that volume in the right earpiece.<br /><br />If it works its a great headset. I was enjoying using it while it lasted, Its comfortable, sits well and is built quite solid. Doesnt look to bad either."
1.0,Purchased for a family member's traveling business.<br />This unit is falsely advertised out the ass.<br />There is no AUX port or USB ports. The antenna is a built-in and sucks.<br />I'd return it but they already threw it away.<br />What a joke
1.0,nope just nope it didnt even fit my goddam computer
1.0,Horribly awkward to hold with case cover folded behind tab.
1.0,The download will not complete.  Pad does not connect to laptop.  I will return this item.
1.0,The item did not work unfortunately.
1.0,DOA
1.0,I want my refund and it's ready to go back
1.0,I'm really pissed off because I wasted money on this AND IT DOESNT EVEN SAY I PURCHASED IT! Don't waste your time people.
1.0,Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,This thing is a cheap piece of Chinese s***.  Stick with a better brand such as Toshiba.
1.0,This product didn't even last a week before it started to fall apart don't waste your money.
1.0,:(
1.0,Failed after less than a month.
1.0,Very dissapointed - it's going to slleep immediatly after any action and it takes a lot of time / clicks / freezes to wake it up again.
1.0,"I expected the color to be a little brighter than it actually is. Also, the material looks really cheap. But I suspect it is durable.<br />Caution: it is very difficult to remove the case once you put it on. So make sure there aren't any particles stuck between your Mac and the case when you put it on."
1.0,"Was a really bad idea bought this product, this tablet got crazy and dosen't let you do anything."
1.0,"so small, it's laughable."
1.0,Way over prices. I would just go with one of the older versions of kindle. It is not worth $400.
1.0,"I am really upset with this &#34;shatterproof&#34; screen protector. My 14 month old had my phone for 1-2 minutes, bit my phone, broke the glass, and swallowed shards of glass. This is the worst screen protector I have ever purchased and would not recommend it to anyone, and if I could give it zero I would."
1.0,Awful controller. Buttons don't work
1.0,Darn thing spontaneously stopped working and all my pictures gone. I called the manufacturer and they are charging me $250 to recover my lost data. Booooo
1.0,wrong cable
1.0,IT WAS THE WRONG ONE FOR MY LAPTOP
1.0,These are not heavy duty cords.  One already has gone out and cannot recommend these to anyone.
1.0,doesn't fit at all
1.0,"The light does not work with my Kindle, which was very disappointing as that was the whole reason I bought it!"
1.0,"Had numerous problems with this laptop from the getgo.  Repeated attempts to reach Dell were futile. All customer service calls are from overseas, which are very difficult to understand. They wouldn't stand behind their product, and only wanted to sell me a $500 service plan. I stopped using this laptop after 6 months of fighting it."
1.0,it didn't work and I returned this.
1.0,"Worked in the beginning, though there was an error message every time I plugged it in. It stopped working within a few weeks. Boo."
1.0,"These cables were all originally working, but after about a couple of weeks, two of them were no longer charging the iPhones. There was a message on the iPhone saying this is not a compatible accessory for the iPhone."
1.0,I bought this battery 3 months ago and about 2 weeks the battery start don't charging 100% and now if i disconnect from the electric source the computer shuts down.
1.0,They don't work....worked for 1 charge
1.0,Broke the first time I used it.
1.0,I threw it in the trash. It did not adhere to the Nook surface at all. Complete junk in my opinion.
1.0,"So disappointed with this Asus GL551JM Gaming Laptop.  I am unable to access my games.  I have had to delete game manager and re-download it numerous times and had a terrible time getting a purchased game to download.  When I try to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime videos, they hang up every few minutes and I have to get out and restart the video to continue viewing.  When I attempt typing an e mail I find myself typing in the middle of a sentence several lines up the page.  Things save to my favorites simply disappear and I have to save them once again.  I have had to stop typing numerous times during this review because I find I am typing in the middle of previously typed words.  The computer frequently skips from one screen to another .  I assure you I could go on and on with complaints, but I feel I would only be wasting my time.  Perhaps this will at least warn others that this is NOT a wise purchase.  If I could return this item, I would be delighted."
1.0,this is very confusing..thought I was buying a tablet but it was only the case.. read carefully b4 purchase
1.0,Does not hold my sd card securely and when transferring files to the memory card it keeps disconnecting..... and all 6 of them that i have are doing it... so its not just one faulty reader.
1.0,"This is supposed to handle high speeds (over 300 mb), but it doesn't. Had to upgrade to the SB6183."
1.0,Just not good quality.  It was scratched very easily - I threw it away and bought ArmorShield instead.
1.0,The case doesn't fit my macbook pro 13&#34;.
1.0,"This product is nothing but a waste of money. #1 They don't actually fit the tablet they say they do (ONE TOUCH PIXI 7). #2 The adhesive is a complete joke. When I put it on, the corner is still sticking up and easily comes off. One thing that's is true is there is no residue when you take it off which i'm very thankful for."
1.0,This quit working after 2weeks
1.0,This speaker has a built in power saving feature that turns the speaker off if it does not detect a signal from your computer.  I work in an office environment and need to keep the volume low.  After researching Creative's support site I tried their recommendation to adjust the computer volume setting to high.  This did not work.  I since sent Creative several emails and get the same answer to the issue.  I would not recommend these speakers.
1.0,Too bad there is no &#34;no star&#34; option.  The device worked as advertised for 10 months and then stopped working entirely.  Buying this is like tossing money down the drain.  I suggest Amazon stop marketing the product.  It is not good for Amazon's reputation.
1.0,Didn't even work
1.0,the space bar not responsive!
1.0,It burned out when I placed it in my computer.
1.0,"Very bad, in the description of the product is not indicated that only posile use in North America, I return it and waste time and money."
1.0,"Drive worked for a year and failed. Lost all my information on it, not happy. Sad that my ancient IDE drive works longer than an SSD."
1.0,Twice I have returned units after they quit working within a week or 10 days. Poor quality. Spend a bit more and get something that works.
1.0,It does not consistently work.  I have changed the batteries twice.
1.0,well i used a lot just for gaming so the batteries died so i changed them and now its unresponsive the red light flashes to movement but its not doing anything onscreen DON'T BUY IT OR NEVER CHANGE THE BATTERIES
1.0,"Ordered this hub based on excellent reviews but I have had nothing but trouble with it. Drops connection with thumb drives regularly, won't maintain usb link to wireless mouse... worthless and not inexpensive. Even swapped out USB cords, thinking it might be a cable issue. Nope.I wanted to like it...but now it's a paperweight. Which, by the way, I don't need. Sigh..."
1.0,The battery was suppose to do an authentic HP battery. But it did not lock into place and kept falling out of the computer. So it was not worth my purchase
1.0,Doesn't fit my Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7.
1.0,I HEAT IT
1.0,Bought this pc from tigerdirect and it didnt power on at all highly disappointed
1.0,"This thing, within in 2 weeks of buying, started glitching. The screen wasn't registering commands, reboot itself, constantly drop internet connection. It may seem like a decent buy but you are just throwing your money away. Pay a few more bucks and get a better one!!!"
1.0,"Turned out to be junk, disappointed in them. 2 of the Chargers stopped working unless I hold it in a certain way."
1.0,One came in already broken and the other one stopped working after 4 months I wouldn't recommend this product!
1.0,"It is not that reliable. It does not use the standard sata port. Once there is any problem, it is impossible to fix! My disk had a failure, now I have to pay $1600 to recover the data!"
1.0,"Could not get the extender to pair with router and after a lengthy call with customer service, they could not either.  Returned."
1.0,"i bought this to work on the bed but now i need to return it because despite the raised cushion, my macbook 13 still slides down when i tilt it slightly higher. Also when I sit crossed legged, the bottom of this desk hurts my legs"
1.0,"all 3 does't work , come with connectivity problem"
1.0,"This battery lasted less than 1 year when it completely stopped charging.  No warning, no loss of power early, just stopped working.  I have contacted the seller 2 times now with absolutely no response.  Sham company, does not stand behind their products.  I will never purchase from them again."
1.0,This case offers no protection.  The Kindle's screen cracked after it slid off a pool chair.  Then Kindle's screen shattered after being placed screen down on the granite counter.  Would not buy this product again.
1.0,"Product arrived and worked for only a month. Now it will not take a charge, it says plugged in not charging. I would not recommend this manufacture of laptop batteries. Shop around and always read the the reviews."
1.0,Worked for two months and no longer functions...
1.0,The front was like melted a bit and the buttons didn't work and I the thing for the dead didn't work ether
1.0,"It does scratch the iPad surface, even after meticulously ensuring clean surfaces of both.  I use it with Notability and several other note taking apps.  If you write fast, strokes will be erased.  This makes what you've written illegible and defeats the purpose of taking notes with it.  The design is nice in the precision it allows.  The clicking while writing is distracting in a meeting room.  I did better with the less expensive fiber tipped styluses from The Friendly Swede.  I waited too long to return it."
1.0,the battery is just as bad as my previous one. Its like they sold me a used battery. when i bought a new one this battery last AT BEST 45 MINUTES if that. I am not happy with my product and i will be returning it.
1.0,"Cheap, flimsy, poor fitting."
1.0,It was damaged
1.0,"I received the wrong item, the discontinued and cheaper version. Since this is an inexpensive item its not worth going through the hassle of exchanging it but im pretty unhappy with that."
1.0,"*updated review*  6/28/2016  So almost a year later and the router no longer work properly. I have flashed the firmware multiple times, reset the router and troubleshooted the router and it keeps dropping the wireless and devices. So this is what I have experienced with the router.   This router is being used with many wireless and wires devices at the same time. 2 3DS, 2 Vitas, PS4,XBone, Wii U, 2 Laptops, 2 Desktops 2 phones, tablet and a Nexus Player. This router should be able to handle this load with out any issue but it is not. The PS4 and XBone will have a Open NAT one minute and the next it would be strict or moderate. A reset fixes this issue. The laptops would lose connection all together. A reset fixes this issues as well.   Now the 3DS and Vitas are strange. The routers WiFi would actually lock up both 3DS if they are in stand by mode and after you restart them the 3DS could not locate the SSID from the router. A reset fixes this issue for a short time. The Vita's well, the router just wont connect to them any more.   All of this slowly have gotten worse over time. I must of gotten a defective unit or just a horrible product.   I have test with my older backup router and all the devices connect to it and have no issues.  The issue is coming from the D-Link AC3200 I have reset this router more less than a year than I have my entire lifetime of routers.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Very easy to setup. If you use it for gaming do yourself a favor and do not use smart connect. With multiple devices it tends to have a small amount of latency when using it. Just setup the tri band with 3 different SSIDs  This will handle many many devices."
1.0,"The image from the cable is terrible on my computer screen, disappointing when all of my other cables work fine, but weren't long enough. I'd avoid it and buy something that was higher quality."
1.0,"Does not work with the Mac like advertised.  There are drivers on the Cable Matters website, but despite many tries, I cannot get this to work on a Mac with OS X Yosemite."
1.0,"This adapter died after 8 months of use.  The cord wore and broke at the tip end.  I repaired it and taped it up, but it failed completely soon thereafter.  A low quality part -- I would not recommend it."
1.0,The damn thing died.  It died in like 2 weeks.  The replacement died just as fast.  This is bad and Sony should feel bad.
1.0,This cable was advertised as being compatible with the Canon Rebel T3 and it is not. Very disappointed.
1.0,"DID NOT WORK WITH MY KINDLE FIRE, WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT."
1.0,Please do not buy from this company.  They worked for 2 weeks and then they don't charge!!  All 3 of mine do not work!! Total rip off
1.0,"I was disappointed with this considering how much I spent on it.  While it is fine for adding additional screens, I had expected more from a docking station however I find that I have to open up my lap top and power it up  (even when in sleep mode) to have the laptop working in the desktop screens, I also have to keep the laptop powered up via its own plug and the Docking station is powered by another lead, I had thought that a &#34;docking station&#34;meant that it would power the laptop and that I would not have to open up the laptop (stored away from the desk) to turn it on - I imagined I could have done that from the docking station on the desk."
1.0,"The keyboard arrived safely but sadly the full stop key does not function; this renders the keyboard entirely unusable.<br />Because of currency exchange reasons not viable to return item for credit, too costly."
1.0,"key was way too small, unable to use this product..."
1.0,Cannot figure out how to install it. YouTube video does not match the product.
1.0,"works great for a couple months, then burns up and fries your battery. been thru a few of these on several different computers. don't bother, just buy the real one."
1.0,"I returned it.......... Loved the color but didn't house the I pad well, not protective.."
1.0,Looks good. Ships from Asia so you should expect 10-20 for it to be delivered.<br />I dump it right away cuz it does not stick to the keyboard at all. It was waste of money for me.
1.0,The charger broke the first time it was used!
1.0,"This product has a fatal flaw.  It does not support the Windows offline files feature.  Using Windows 7, the Offline availability indicates &#34;Not available&#34;.  I have used a succession of NAS drives for many years (Buffalo and Seagate).  None of my past NAS drives was perfect but all of these drives have supported windows &#34;offline files&#34; feature out of the box.  I find &#34;offline files&#34; indispensable for a NAS drive.  Not only does it allow easy backups, which you can control, but it allows multiple users to work on the same project in the field without accidentally overwriting each others work.  The Windows Offline files feature also allows multiple laptops to be set up to back each other up for hardware failure.  When your laptop gives you the blue screen of death or you drop it while working on a ladder, no problem, just hit sync on your backup machine and at least you are back where you started the day (or better if you synced remotely).  You can have different laptops or tablets for different tasks and keep them all synced and ready to go.  In my opinion a NAS drive is not complete without the Windows Offline Files feature.  This limitation should have been clearly stated in the product advertising and literature."
1.0,All three died after a couple of weeks
1.0,Lasted 3 months.  Nothing more to say other than Logitech is a waste or money.
1.0,WARNING: This will NOT fit a 2015 Kindle Fire HD7. The camera opening and speakers seemed to be reversed on my model.
1.0,its a bit to small
1.0,"Buffalo doesn't support upgrading to a larger hard drive despite manual mentioning using a larger drive. Support told me they didn't sell this device to be upgraded and that I would have problems (which I was), and when I pointed out they sell different size units, and the manual says I can use a larger drive I was told the same line, they don't support a larger drive. When told I was going to return it the Buffalo agent simply replied, Thanks for contacting us, have a nice day. Needless to say I will not be purchasing these products again for my customers."
1.0,Dont waste your money!!
1.0,"Absolute junk. Flimsy plastic housing, and the usb ports stopped working after 35 days. HDE refused my request for a return/refund, past 30 days you're on your own."
1.0,This battery I received is not the OEM one that is pictured. It is a randomly refurbished MO06 battery. Not even the same model number as my battery. You can clearly see that the cells have just been replaced. I would say go through HP- but even they do not stand by their products anor offer an acceptable replacement battery. Save your money and buy somewhere else if you need a battery ( I will continue to search).<br /><br />On top of it just stay away from HP.
1.0,Did not work
1.0,"Sorry guys, this one absolutely does not work with the 3-prong adapter.  You all who say it does are probably referring to [[ASIN:B000BTL0OU Kensington Travel Plug Adapter with USB Charger (33346)]].  I am currently in Germany and brought both... I had the one in the link already and bought this one instead of a duplicate because I liked the fact that it has 2 built-in USB ports.<br /><br />I was planning to use both with my two [[ASIN:B00ATZJ5YS Belkin SurgePlus 3-Outlet Mini Travel Swivel Charger Surge Protector with Dual USB Ports (2.1 AMP / 10 Watt)]].  It works with the one shown in the link, exactly as people describe.  You can get the grounding pole into the rectangular 'hole' just fine.  See the photo of the rounded/mickey mouse style adapter that has the 3-pole halfway in to show the feasibility.<br /><br />On this adapter with the 2 usb ports, however, that hole is further from the two prongs and the grounding pole does not reach.  There IS a blank cover that is in the perfect place and size on the other side of the prong slots, but it is covered off because the electronics for the usb ports are directly underneath it. Two photos included of this newer, rectangular adapter that shows it does not take 3-pole.<br /><br />Overall, incredibly disappointing, and you guys need to check your facts.  If you still believe it is possible, reply here and post a photo of this EXACT adapter with a 3-pole being utilized.<br /><br />Frustrated with Kensington for a poorly designed 'newer model' and with the claims it takes a 3-pole.  Returning upon arrival back in the States."
1.0,"I've tried this on 3 different computers, using Two different OS's(Linux and Windows 10) and multiple access points and the connection drops every 25 minutes or so, I'm unsure if its a faulty product or just a poorly made one"
1.0,Did play in speaker loud enough.
1.0,This time is no good at all . My is already bloke
1.0,"Internet connection light was solid green, yet my devices frequently stated that there was no connection to the internet.  Tried it in different spots in my 2 story house, but nothing made a difference. IT DOES BROADCAST YOUR SSID. I know that that isn't the best/only method of securing your wifi but it does make it easier to see if it's broadcasted.  Bought a Netgear EX2700 instead, it allows you to disable broadcasting and the internet connection works perfectly in the same spots I put the TP-LINK product in."
1.0,Was clearly used. A maxell disc was still in the drive.
1.0,Super unstable!  I suspect there is some connection error inside the device
1.0,Did not work with AT&T.  Could not program it.
1.0,Macbook Pro stopped recognizing drive. Lost CD inside because of &#34;no eject button&#34; Very noisy while running. Sent back for refund. Do not buy this drive.
1.0,SAMSUNG M3 Portable 1 TB 2.5 inch external hard drive<br /><br />although I originally gave this Hard Drive a positive review I have since changed my mind- having transferred docs onto it for safe keeping I have found myself unable to retrieve anything from the HD. I have been told that there is no possibility of accessing the documents therefore I am stuck with loosing everything.I am a teacher I had researched the best buy at the time I purchased in March 2014 but in just over a year it packed up on me. I had schemes of work and plans that have now been lost!
1.0,Very disappointed. Was my 5th fire...TOO SMALL...COULD NOT INCREASE FONT SIZE ANY BIGGER THAN 3. RETURNED TO Office Depot for refund
1.0,Did not work nor charged.
1.0,"This quit working after a month. I am so disappointed. I had one before that last a year until the charging unit inside got broken by my daughter trying to plug it in, so I bought a new one here. Well, after a month it started shutting off by it's self and wouldn't stay on longer than 30 seconds. So annoying."
1.0,"Very disappointed!  This is my 5th, and last, Toshiba. I bought this laptop specifically because the specs say the memory is upgradeable to 16g, which I wanted to do to improve the speed of video editing.  What Toshiba is falling to tell customers is that the memory can only be upgraded by them, at an obscenely expensive cost...almost as much as the laptop.  All my other Toshiba's allowed me to upgrade my memory via a little access door on the bottom.  Not this one.  There's no way for the user to upgrade the memory, and Toshiba is intentionally misleading consumers by not stating this fact in the specs, or on the Amazon sale page.  Likewise with the hard drive.  If you want to change the HD to a SSD, or even have to re-seat the HD (which my older Toshiba has required more than once)  it's not possible.  This laptop is specifically designed to cost the user as much money as possible when it needs anything at all. Even the simplest of upgrades requires an expensive trip to Toshiba.  This laptop is so woefully deficient in memory that you can't even take a screenshot of a Facebook page when you have no other program open but your browser, and 55% of your memory available. (See photo)  Secondly, this laptop is physically dangerous in that the edge is so sharp it actually cuts your wrists when trying to type on it.  Perhaps Toshiba anticipated that customers would want to slit their wrists after waisting $700.00 on this cheaply made hunk of junk?  If so, this laptop is equipped to do the job.  Simply sliding your hand over to the numbers pad can draw blood....really.  Unfortunately, since it was not &#34;dead on arrival&#34; I can't send it back to Amazon, so I'm stuck with an over priced hunk of junk and the hope that there will be a class action suit regarding both the wrist slashing, and Toshiba's false and misleading claim that the memory is upgradeable.  Unless you are contemplating suicide by laptop keyboard, avoid this Toshiba like the plague.."
1.0,These worked did what they were suppose to but didn't even last 3months. The cord broke where it connect to the controller but you get what you pay for. Will now be buying another headset.
1.0,Was very disappointed...could hardly even see the joker print on it because it was printed so small
1.0,"some of the worst cables iv gotten, no one of the three lasted more than a couple of days of light use<br />beyond that the flat design of it also makes the cables tangle a lot even though its braided"
1.0,Well I got the hard drive but it's not working right I connect it to a laptop and it read the hard drive but the icon didn't pop up on the screen I couldn't find it no where on the computer  I tried this several times nothing now I can't use my new hard drive. What ever you do don't buy this item......
1.0,Broke after 1 month
1.0,"DO NOT BUY, First try and POWER SUPPLY ARCED and SMOKED and almost on FIRE, my power strip saved the day. DO NOT BUY"
1.0,Does not work for iPad AIR 2
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. It would lag even only playing Youtube or Netflix video.
1.0,Do not buy these cords. I bought 5. One broke immediate (prong separated from the cord). Three of them don't actually charge i phones or i pads and  one actually works.
1.0,Stop working after 4 months
1.0,I had to replace them after 6 months
1.0,Kindle Reader was returned because it was not as versatile as my Kindle Fire.  Protection Plan was therefore not usable nor transferable to my other unit.
1.0,I will never buy LaCie Again. Terrible drives that always crap out and refuse to mount after only a few months.
1.0,Crap
1.0,I does NOT fit correctly in my phone.  Because of that it doesn't even register that it's in my phone.
1.0,I bought this headset for my son for his birthday. He just plugged it into his computer and it started STEAMING and won't work 10 minutes after he started using it. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product!
1.0,They worked for about 2 weeks. They no longer work and I get a &#34;not supported&#34; message.
1.0,Its a plastic . Very very bad quality.
1.0,"The display started to fade shortly after warranty ended.  I often had trouble syncing it to my Mac.  Tech support is practically non-existent.  After four months of trying to contact Livescribe, I finally was able to get the pen to sync.  Waste of money."
1.0,"Bought it for my little cousin because she loves Disney Princesses, but Very cheap quality...received it damaged."
1.0,I ordered a slot-in disc drive. The one I received was not a slot-in.
1.0,The case was nice but it totally screwed up the kindle
1.0,Doesn't work. Buyer beware
1.0,"Constantly looses connection, no serious PC support, the android app is pretty awful.<br />Overall this is a nice device for geeking out, but not something you could actually use.<br /><br />If they at lrast made some decent improvements to PC connectivity it might become useful"
1.0,My great granddaughter loves it
1.0,No good
1.0,Very cheap cable with ethernet connectors.  The wires inside are not twisted pair and are very very thin.
1.0,Absolutely terrible piece of hardware. I am on my 3rd one and it just failed. I've spent more money on shipping the bads one back for a replacement. I'm done with this thing...total waste of time and money. I asked the company to send me a better unit and I would pay the difference but they would not do.
1.0,Followed battery instructions and after one month will only charge to 74%.  Would like a replacement if possible to see if it is only this specific battery.
1.0,Battery was bad right out of the box. wouldn't hold a charge
1.0,"The item is a bit misleading in as much as the size. I believe it stated 6 inches, which I'm thinking in height and it's in overall length. So what you get is this little emblem 6&#34; in length and aprox 1&#34; in heigth.  Cute but kinda worthless in application."
1.0,I have not been able to get one of these flash drives to work yet even formatting them
1.0,This order sucks!!!! I had put the new white shell on my controller and all of the screw holes were in the wrong place. I had put my controller back together and the shell BROKE my battery for my controller!! I had to buy a new replacement battery for it!!
1.0,Did not work at all!!! Waste of money!
1.0,worked for about 2 weeks. then it died.ordered a secondary one. that one didnt even work. So off to Dell i go to buy a replacement.
1.0,Do NOT order these.  About half didn't work at all and could not be formatted.
1.0,"I've owned this case for about a month and the glue has started to deteriorate around the edges. This is unexpected and disheartening. I will not buy Pad and Quill again.<br /><br />At first, I was so thrilled with the case because it feels very sturdy and looks even better. I wasn't even upset that I couldn't use a third-party Lightning cord because the cutout is too small. It feels well made. But don't let that fool you because the edges don't hold well to the leather backing.<br /><br />This case has been mostly been sitting in a backpack on being used in my hands. I've never dropped it though I came close. I would not recommend this product."
1.0,Only one of the three cords in this pack worked correctly. I would suggest you find a different brand!
1.0,"Loses connection constantly, I had to install/reinstall/uninstall/install various drivers to get this to work with mouses, speakers ect ect. Pay the money, get something nice. This isnt worth it."
1.0,"I bought this wire so that my girlfriend wouldn't have to being her charger with her when she stayed over. After 2 weeks of use, the cord has to be at a specific angle in order to charge properly. Other than this unique position, the cord will not charge the phone. There are no breaks on the covering, so this is just a faulty internal design."
1.0,Product was DOA. Will not buy another Toshiba.
1.0,"This cable started to break almost as soon as I got it. The braid separated from the connector working a short time, and finally the lightning cable snapped off. I got a replacement from Amazon and it broke within two days."
1.0,"I purchased this mouse May 12 and received it May 14, since then the mouse has been slowly malfunctioning.  The problem is the optical sensor would periodically give out and not track the movement of the mouse.  The other buttons work fine but you would suddenly lose mouse movement and this is a huge problem for a gaming mouse!  The only way the mouse can recover from this malfunction would be to unplug the usb wire from the computer and plug it back in.  I've tried this on multiple computers but the problem persists.  Hey, what can you expect from a $11 mouse..."
1.0,"This is not an EOM Cable.  When I plug my Samsung S4 into this, I get a warning message to use the original charger as the phone will charge slower using this setup.  After some testing, it appears that the charger is adequate, but the cable is not.  If I put the original cable onto this charger, it does not produce the error message.<br /><br />This vendor should be eliminated for selling &#34;knock offs&#34;."
1.0,"From the first day I got it out of the package, it didn't work. I tried it the next day and it worked. That was the ONLY time it worked. I gave it a few tries on different TVs and it just doesn't work."
1.0,In less than a month the screen showed a good side the other half very dull! Will be asking for a refund!
1.0,Simply: it never worked. Even the IT guys from work couldnt get it to function.
1.0,BX USB 2.0 Super etc. fell apart before the first use. Snapped the DVD carrier right off. Cheap plastic and never used and never will be. Junk
1.0,"Did'nt like this computer it was very flimsy, the mouse pad did'nt click with ease and took a few taps instaed of just one to navigate, so I returned it and Amazon made that process so quick and smooth I was very impressed with the service, I have bought other laptops thru Amazon that I love such as my Google Chromebook"
1.0,It broke the first time I used it.  Very disappointed.  The plug just pulled right out.  I will be returning both.
1.0,Does not fit our Sony cybershot. Need charging cable so back to the drawing board.
1.0,The card does not bring integrated multimedia port.
1.0,"Within minutes of plugging this in, there was a crackling sound and the smell of burning.  The indicator light went out and it will not charge my computer.  This product is terrible and a waste of money."
1.0,Awful!! They took the hard drive out of the computer so it was like buying a brand new one all over. Would not recommend them to anyone. Very disappointed
1.0,"Had to return 2 times. After I got the second one, I didn't believe the board has a problem but the computer won't start. So I spent $50 to a professional to exam the parts and it turned out the board is defective again. It must be great board for price IF IT WORKS."
1.0,this product is a clear rip off of the speck cases and was supposed to include a keyboard that never came. It was a flimsy piece of 99 cent plastic from china.
1.0,"Don't expect that paying a lot for this router will make it work consistently. This router works less consistently than any of my previous routers, including those that were substantially cheaper. It started off great for about 2 weeks, then services stop working sporadically. I'm not even talking about all of the fluffy create-your-own-cloud services; core services fail for no reason. Don't buy this router; go buy any cheap router, throw DDWRT or Tomato on it and call it a day.<br />Yes I have the most up to date firmware; yes I've tried Merlin's most-stable build."
1.0,It's falling a part
1.0,"Had problems confirmed by a local computer repair company at a cost of $70, have to return it. To be fair, the repair company said that this particular motherboard is usually very good, and they recommended that I just get the same board from a different vender."
1.0,"I bought two of these a year ago and they still work great, ordered 3 more in April and the quality is different and 2 of the 3 no longer work.  The iPhone says accessoryis not supported."
1.0,"I never write reviews but I have to for this keyboard it rarely connect from the beginning to my mac, I should have returned it then but didn't(mistake). I would have to restart computer everytime it went to sleep to get it to connect. Now it won't connect at all. Waste of money! It should be taken back. I have read other reviews say the same thing. I hope someone from Anker sees this and makes right by it Becuase I'm very disappointed!"
1.0,dont waste your money. I tried to connect with to my tv from my tablet and phone. Did not work. I returned this product.
1.0,It is not working at all
1.0,Does NOT fit with iPhone 6 life proof case as advertised.  I bought these specifically because it said it would.  This is an unfortunate lapse in Amazon's quality control.  Notice on the picture where the red charger neck is larger than the factory neck and won't pass through the charging port in the life proof case
1.0,I got CSR 4.0 Dongle Bluetooth adapter instead SATECHI USB 4.0 Bluetooth adapter.
1.0,Poor quality microphone. Its very hard to hear anyone unless they are very close.
1.0,I bought this to use with Wii to play old Nintendo 64 games.  It didn't work.
1.0,"We tried two of these units, and both had the same problem.  We found the Wi-Fi connections to be unstable.  Specifically, Skype-to-Skype calls regularly dropped off.  Loss of connectivity during regular internet usage was not as noticeable, but likely because it typically does not require a constant stream of data.  A completely different modem/router has eliminated the issues, so I can say definitively that the cause of the problems was the SBG6580 (specifically its Wi-Fi connectivity).<br /><br />Some have posted that power levels from the ISP may be the cause of the problem, but this is only if the modem itself loses its connection.  Wired connectivity did not seem to be an issue, only Wi-Fi.  So, that solution does not apply to the particular issue I am talking about.<br /><br />Also, take note that the dual-band frequencies do not operate concurrently.  It is switchable, so you can either run the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz, but not both at the same time.<br /><br />I have had good experiences with other Arris/Motorola networking hardware, but this model was a huge disappointment."
1.0,Does not fit the Kinlde
1.0,"This product does not work! & seller claims to have &#34;90 day warranty&#34; but after purchase, you cannot find this information anywhere. After several factory resets to get this thing to work, and it still not working, I've determined it's a waste of money. I kept receiving the following image and it just wouldnt work. Buy something else!"
1.0,"I emailed this to HP:<br /><br />In April, I purchased a 2-1 laptop from Amazon.com. My previous laptop (an HP model) was beat up and on its last legs and I was excited to purchase the 2-1 at a great price and a new HP product.<br /><br />I received my computer a few dyas later and the keyboard didn't work at all but I knew I had the onscreen keyboard and that was fine. A few weeks after getting the computer I started having issues with the wireless connections. The wireless signal would drop and say &#34;no networks found&#34; whether I was at home using the wireless or at my place of work. Each location would normally show 6 or more networks, yet my new laptop couldn't read any. After using your horrid website for support, I finally found an 800 number to call. I explained the situation with the wireless and keyboard, I was sent a box, shipped it to HP and a week later the computer came back &#34;fixed&#34;.<br /><br />After a week or two, the same thing happened again...&#34;no networks found&#34; once again. The good news was the keyboard worked. Same routine, called, box, ship, repair, shipped back.<br /><br />A few days later I started having the same wireless issues. At this point, my feeling was the issue is unfixable and when at home I was able to reconnect by going into the control panel. However, calamity struck again as the computer would not turn on at all. I called HP support and explained that the wireless still wasn't fixed and now the computer would not even turn on. I told the outsourced support tech that the computer was a lemon and they needed to send me a new one as a replacement. He asked me where I purchased it from. I told him Amazon.com. He said they couldn't replace it because I didn't buy it from HP. Wait, WHAT? HP will not replace a defective computer that it built? HP will not stand behind its products because I didn't purchase it directly from them?<br /><br />Your outsourced tech just wanted to trouble shoot the problem, following hisscript instead of listening to the customer and, you know, actuallty trying to help me...I asked him several times to just send me the box so they can &#34;repair&#34; the computer. Finally he sends me to his &#34;supervisor&#34; who wants to trouble shoot....AGAIN. I told her several times to just send me the box, that I already did the trouble shoot with the other guy and it still wouldn't turn on...I repeated to her that the computer was a lemon and they should replace it but she said they wouldn't do that. The call dropped (My phone was the issue-no one on your outsourced end ended the call). This took place on Saturday, August 22nd. I received a voicemail on Wednesday, August 26 from HP support asking me if I still wanted the support ticket open and that they have tried to call me several times. If I was called, no message was left until Wednesday and I generally do not pick up the phone<br /> when I recieve calls from unfamilair numbers, so the effort to reach me was minimal at best and I should have been called back within minutes of the call disconnecting, not hours or days.<br /><br />Since HP wouldn't stand behind their product I contacted Amazon.com. My return window had long since passed but I explained the situation to their customer service rep and he placed me on hold to talk to his supervisor about a solution for me. The call dropped-again issues on my end. But guess what? He called me back within 5 minutes. He told me that Amazon.com would allow me to return the product and credit me back the cost of the defective computer and I could then purchase something of my choosing with the funds. Five minutes after that, I had an email with the return sticker so that I could ship your lemon computer back to Amazon.com.<br /><br />So, what have we learned? 1. Amazon.com cares about its customers and stands behind what it sells. 2. HP doesn't care about its customers and doesn't stand behind what it manufactures. 3. I won't be purchasing any more HP products.<br /><br />HP emailed me back and wants to talk to me about these issues. Of course they can only call me between 8am and 5pm PST Monday-Friday...which is when I work...and won't be taking their call. I told them if they really want to talk to me they can call me any week night after 6pm PST.<br /><br />A HUGE thank you to Amazon.com for helping me and standing behind the products they sell. A lesson all manufacturers and retailers should take note of. This is why I will continue to be a loyal amazon.com shopper."
1.0,"case packaging was nearly destroyed upon arrival, however the inner box appeared OK. the keys look good and are quite well spaced, but it does not charge or turn on, the charging light comes on but the actual power switch turns it on for a second then nothing, cant get the power light to come on after that. cant get it to pair its just dead. disappointing really, it is a really nice looking case."
1.0,"it doesn work , its a garbage"
1.0,"When it's working, this hub is fine. But it spontaneously turns itself off, and other than a complete reboot, there doesn't seem to be any way to bring it back up.  I would NOT buy this unit again - in fact, I'm buying something else to replace it because of its unreliability."
1.0,it doesn't charge
1.0,This is the worst case ever!! The top part went on fine but the bottom part wouldn't even snap into place properly. Overall it just feels like a cheaply made product at a high price. Returning.
1.0,Sorry but these don't work reliably.  I have an iPhone 6 and these do that &#34;bing bing bing&#34; of going in and out of contact when plugged in.  Annoying.  I keep trying alternatives to paying full price for the Apple ones and so far I keep getting disappointed.  Don't waste your money on these.
1.0,You can build a better PC for $1000 and better monitors for $1000. This is PC probably has a s*** motherboard and s*** GPU!
1.0,"Worked three or four times, but computer will no longer recognize it."
1.0,"While this item may have worked the four or five times I used it, it broke less than TWO months after purchasing!  When I went to try and return the iem or get another one, I got the message that it was past the date of return.  Would NOT recommend if you plan on using frequently,"
1.0,Dosent work for Xbox like it says it does
1.0,"This case came apart after only 4 weeks of gentle use.  I have friends who made the choice to purchase $2 knock off cases through eBay that have held up better than this case.  I ended up purchasing a case from Turtleback that has been a 1000 times better and after 6 months of use is still just as good as the day I bought it.<br /><br />The bottom line if you want to blow your money on a case that is built terribly and falls apart easily you can spend a lot less at eBay and it will still probably hold up better than this one does.  If you are looking to spend your money on a nice case that looks, feels, and performs great I strongly suggest you look for a different item as this is not it.  I honestly wish I could rate it 0 stars."
1.0,"Some windows have low quality display, specially control panel options. It is much more slower than I would expect from this laptop. Sometimes I plug in headphones and the sound just dies, I have to constantly restart it and turn it on and off because it gets so slow. Since I did the windows 10 upgrade, the computer keeps getting stuck and it is unusable: the start button does not work, if I restart it, the task takes forever, forcing me to manually turn it off and on. I HATE it.  It is also fair to say that Amazon Customer Service took care of the return and refund of the item even though it was about three months later. So this is a bad review for the item itself but a good review for amazon customer service"
1.0,This router was slow and had no range on it whatsoever.  I live in a split level house and this router would also disconnect my phone all of the time.  It was practically unusable.  Immediately returned it and bought a Netgear R6250 and that works amazing on the 5ghz.  I now get 65mbps my new router.
1.0,Much too high of a price for an outdated socket type. A core quad @ 3.0 goes for around $80. The extra .2 is not worth the huge price difference. For this price an lga 1150 quad can be bought.
1.0,"These criminals selling hacked SD micro cards think that they're being smarter these days.  They write more fake 5 star reviews to offset the certain 1 star ratings that real buyers will certainly give.  Then,  to make their 5 star reviews seem more believable,  they give &#34;cons&#34; in their reviews (&#34;it was great and reads fast,  but I was a little disappointed in the write speed&#34; knowing darned well that anyone reading the review will say &#34;heck,  I usually read a lot but only write once...no big deal&#34;). News flash scammers: you're still cons,  criminals,  and lacking in cerebral substance...oh,  and your slightly improved English still makes you transparent. We can spot an out of use piece of vernacular faster than a cheap 128gb SD card in a sea of real ones.  Don't buy this card.  It's a fake."
1.0,"Way over priced, can be found every where for $25."
1.0,"Worst cable ever, it heats up while charging, takes longer to charge, and the fabric surounding the cable start giving up at both ends after a week of usage"
1.0,the 2GB SD memory Card would not format.
1.0,Misleading<br />This does not come with a cord to charge the device and does not say so in the details.  You have to buy it separately which is the whole reason I bought this was to charge my tablet because mine broke. Still can't charge it due to no cord came with it.
1.0,I wish I had returned it. I've had wired versions of this mouse I've used for over ten years. LOVE IT. However this one never tracks correctly. I've tried gaming mouse pads and different placements of the usb connector. Nothing helps. It sucks. REALLY WISH I HAD THE CORDED VERSION. =(
1.0,Not correct screen
1.0,"It didn't work for me, unfortunately. Now not sure what I will do with this since I had it shipped overseas."
1.0,I bought 2 and one of them stopped working after getting really hot to the touch about 2 weeks later.
1.0,my screen is jumping from it
1.0,It doesn't work on an Apple ipad.  LIARS!!!!
1.0,"this promised to be such a great machine. purchased at costco, keyboard back light was not operational out of the box. phoned tech support, they were unable to provide any resolution. the following day, the machine went into infinite slumber. power light flashing, black screen, no response to any press of any button, no matter how long. after three hours on the line with tech support, i was given a case number. returned the machine to costco. purchased another one, exact same device. it worked for 72 hours, and failed in the exact same manner as the first. keyboard back light went out, and power button flashing while the computer remains in infinite sleep. took 90 minutes with lenovo tech support to declare this second computer a hardware failure. it, too, will be returned, and replaced with another brand. unfortunate, as i really liked the features and feel of the flex3, but two complete failures that take all your files and software with them is quite enough.  lenovo tech support was not the least bit helpful, and not clued in to the features of their own product. tech support suggested i remove the battery and see if the computer would reboot. the machine's battery is integrated. removing the battery requires removing the computer case, which, by their own policy, voids the warranty. moving on..."
1.0,Lenovo T440s would not recognize the added memory. Returned it with no issue from Amazon. Purchased Crucial brand and it worked fine.
1.0,"Worked flawlessly. Hand placement is a little awkward with the touchpad and that slows down typing a little, but I don't know where else you would put it.<br /><br />But it broke after two months. Sounds like something's rattling around in there. Power light turns on but it won't charge, enter pairing mode, or connect with anything. The durability of this product is seriously questionable."
1.0,"The story starts in 2014.<br /><br />I bought the NovaStor backup system for my laptop, a high end Toshiba widescreen. My order was placed at a particularly busy time in my business cycle and so I did not rush to install the software. I activated it, decided that the instructions were not clearly written and that I did not have time to work on it just then.<br /><br />When I did try to work through the backup process, I found that the buttons on the main work screen popup are all below the bottom of my laptop display. There is no scroll bar on the right side and the software is unusable. So I wrote to NovaStor's support people.<br /><br />The first email I received from NovaStor support had no relationship at all to the problem at hand – nothing at all. Even better, though, I received a &#34;case closed how did we do?&#34; email survey before I received the whacky support letter.<br /><br />I replied to NovaStor support and also to the survey saying that my problem was not solved. When the reply came, the technician said that there is no way to use the software without resizing the laptop display. That's it. Think about rebooting 4 times a day to do 2 backups.<br /><br />I applied for a refund for this unusable software but my request was denied because it had been over 30 days since my purchase. The Customer Service Dude was rude because I dared to ask for a refund outside of the warranty period.<br /><br />Why waste your time with an arrogant company that can't produce a usable interface?<br /><br />2015 Update.<br /><br />My computer crashed and when I tried to reinstall Novastor, I found that the serial number was &#34;disabled&#34;. I contacted Novastor to get a new serial number password or other workaround. The customer service department is rude and uninformed, wasting weeks of my time before sending me to another department that told me I had to buy a completely new installation."
1.0,Buttons are next to impossible to push. Have to give up using it.
1.0,"Didn't work for me. I have a Netgear router, and I tried setting up multiple times. Maybe just doesn't work with my router."
1.0,It's a good thing I bought 4 of these because 2 have broken already just from plugging them into my phone.
1.0,Unfortunately didn't work as advertised. My house is not that big and this device wasn't able to extend the wireless signal.
1.0,"I was looking for a good iPad mini keyboard when found this , I thought it was going to be the one my son would love for his iPad typing .<br />When I received it first thing was charging it  then keyboard would not pair to iPad and not just that<br />Connect button/light do not work.<br />The keyboard is made of cheap plastic that to my believe it would break just after a few uses<br />So called Amazon and sending it back.. If you are looking for something like this.  Look elsewhere."
1.0,"Doesn't work - in fact, causes interference with our network. Instructions were almost indecipherable - online videos helped, but don't waste your money on this product."
1.0,The charger broke within a day
1.0,"Horrible, was not the right configuration for my laptop model HP G62"
1.0,"After 2 days of use the computer no longer recognizes this drive. It can not be formatted, and I have lost all saved data. I tried to return it, but because I did not use it for a few weeks, it is no longer eligible for return. I may as well have used the money to lite a fire......which is where this drive is destined to end up. Ridiculous piece of equipment."
1.0,To small
1.0,Bought two (2) 1T units for a RAID1 Array in late July 2015.  Installed them at beginning of Aug 2015.  Found one failed 8-30-2015.  Last day to return was 8-28-2015.  Make sure you buy the 2 year warranty from Amazon for the $5.00 if you are going to use these pieces of junk.
1.0,It just stopped charging and I'm not the only one that has this problem. I only had this for two weeks
1.0,Bought for use with a Lenovo Windows tablet as I liked the idea of flexible sockets. Unfortunately it did not work for me. Another single socket OTG USB cable did work so I don't think it's a limitation on my tablet though it could be.
1.0,Already had to replace will not hold a charge
1.0,Brought tablet from Walmart 'WiFi stop working after two months sent it back to ematic they kept it for around 2 months. Got it back and<br />Headphone jack hasn't work properly since been a year now you have prop charger cable against something to charge it
1.0,"had kinks in it,slower than wifi"
1.0,hand worked anything I plugged it in.
1.0,Charged my Kindle one time then stopped working
1.0,They fall apart constantly. I'm down to my last one already. Size great but very cheap. Don't bother
1.0,Will run the laptop but will not charge a battery. Also makes a humming sound and get's warm. Don't waste your time on this one. I have another genuine Dell charger and it charges the battery fine. This one is just junk.
1.0,"Power cycles numerous times every time my laptop awakes from sleep mode.  I've already disabled the &#34;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power&#34; setting, along with all other power management settings that might be contributing to this problem.  Also, installing the latest driver (1.0.0.32) was a chore.  Not sure why the standalone driver also includes a &#34;Genie&#34; component, but I figure Netgear's software engineers may be a bit behind the times, and I'm not even a developer."
1.0,"Product not at all what was expected. Did not have &#34;Kuzy&#34; label anywhere, looked like a generic brand. The letters/numbers on keyboard were poorly printed and the colors were faded."
1.0,Doesnt stand up after a few uses
1.0,I've had this since July and it has already broke- the clip aspect broke off completely.
1.0,"It looked really nice..for the first few weeks. I purchased two of them for our computers, one started cracking on week three and the other cracked a month after. They both cracked in the corners and continuously chip off  when we open them. We're already replacing them. What a disappointment."
1.0,DO NOT BUY. Nothing but problems with this computer.
1.0,"Power button is cheap, broke within a week and we could not fix it. My daughter was upset. Wish we had spent the money and got a good tablet."
1.0,all 3 corrupted when i tried to use them what piles of junk
1.0,This mouse is worthless. The battery compartment doesn't last too long. Eventually it won't work. Don't buy it.
1.0,"Multiple keys stopped working after a few days. Not worth the money, I suggest you take your business eleswhere."
1.0,This appears to be well made. After connecting it up to my Nuc5i5myhe and my Panasonic TV it started locking up my CEC enabled devices on the TV. After disconnecting the adaptor everything CEC started working again. It doesn't appear that this was ever tested.
1.0,"Never really impressed with the sound of this unit for the price. The Logitech Gaming Software is horrendous. I also have a G510, an M510 and the previous version of the G510. I always hoped the software would get better but I guess Logitech sees this as an afterthought. The main reason for the review is that these headphones at first seem like quality. If you look on the inside of them, they even have real screws holding these things together. Well, mine literally fell apart tonight when I picked them up. Guess what?!? Those screws that you see are not screws. It is just a cheap plastic trick to make you think you have a quality product. Those screws are not actually screws. It is just an outer appearance...unbelievable. How much did Logitech actually save by engineering in fake screws into the plastics vs. actually just placing in screws into the headset? I have used Logitech for many years but no more."
1.0,I haven't even been using this product for two months before it stopped working. This is a piece of crap and a waste of money. No I did not drop it or damage it. It just stopped working. I'm extremely disappointed.
1.0,After hours of troubleshooting... I found on a forum that these (the MX line) do not work in Toshiba Tecra laptops. If you intend on using these in a Toshiba Tecra... look elsewhere. http://forum.crucial.com/t5/Crucial-SSDs/MX100-and-Toshiba-Tecra-Z50-A-11E-detection-problem/td-p/162910
1.0,"Be very careful of this item.  When you go to try to set it up thru the process they recommend it gets you to support, but with added expense to set it up.  Haven't try this on the road yet, works at home but only as an extender, can't setup all the features on it because they tell me that my computer is infected and won't let it happen, and for $150 they will fix it.  There is always something with this electronic stuff, stuff that they don't warn you about before purchase.  Also if you try and download software that is suppose to help you out, there is all kinds of problems with attachments in that software.  If you want your networking to utilize this as just an extender, which it will not hold to automatically startup, then be aware of that feature only.  Very disappointed in Netgear with this item, have had and still have many of their items."
1.0,"was a waste of money because I cannot figure out how to put it in, the instructions on your website were for some other kindle."
1.0,fell out of the socket by just the weight of the cord.. You had to hold it just right to get a charge.
1.0,Extremely poor fit. Cables have to be moved back and forth to make connection and even then it's hit or miss.
1.0,Not correct cord adapter for r33030 very disappointed
1.0,they worked for one week and then diied
1.0,"Feels cheap.  Very light, Would have been better if built into the laptop, or, at least, provide longer cords."
1.0,I used this for two weeks and it kept popping out my iPad. and it is not self turn off as advertised
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,It looks impressive but it only worked for a couple of weeks
1.0,The stand is sub-par and doesn't even attach to the ipad.  Taking the label off left a sticky mess that I can't remove.  Now I find out it would cost more to return it than I paid for the item.
1.0,"Initially this product was wonderful, but now it seems the cord is not charging properly. It comes and goes as far as the charging capability, needless to say I am not very happy right now. I may have y replace it again."
1.0,"Doesn't work , don't buy"
1.0,"Horrible extender, maybe 30 extra feet."
1.0,This product has not worked since I got it. It doesn't accept charge and will not turn on.
1.0,Does not charge. The original adapter does not work so I purchased another and that one does not work either. Now I'm a few days late to return item. Piece of junk.
1.0,"It stpped working not even s month after I bought it. I like to take a good care of my electronics, so it was not because I didn't take car of ite. I was very disappointed with this product."
1.0,Too mushy.... Doesn't hold I pad in place!
1.0,Will not hold charge already had to replace
1.0,"The DC connector is much larger than as pictured or required. It’s 7.4 mm wide, instead of 4.5 mm needed to be a replacement for AA65NM121.  It’s outer case is also not as pictured.  This is one of three vendors who showed the correct picture and part numbers, but supplied a different product.  (probably all using the same flawed database)."
1.0,They suck
1.0,Fits fine but the handles are flop not handles at all and it costs more to send back than you pay for it I found out the hard way I paid 8.98 to send it back dumb I know but I didn't look to see the cost before  printing out the label.  Anyway the tablet it's for is junk too so I sent the tablet back too
1.0,It does't work
1.0,"The NETGEAR router has slightly better reviews than Asus, but that only counts if it works. Maybe it will work on your network, or maybe it will randomly drop connections like it did with me. The Asus router works perfectly so far."
1.0,Dont bother. By an Intel. Tried one. Came with password protection on. Wont accept default passwords provided by SanDisk.Wont let me access. Nice papaerweight.
1.0,Did not work on my Amazon HDX 8.9 fire tablet(3rd generation)
1.0,"The connection piece that goes from the headset to the controller does not work, people can hear me but I cannot hear them, I'm dissatisfied because after all, I paid for one day shipping, and still had to switch to my old mic."
1.0,"Worthless, does not work at all.  Not worth my time returning but this thing does not work."
1.0,Slowwwwww
1.0,This item did not work. It took around 3 weeks to be delivered.
1.0,bad quality product. Do not buy it.
1.0,Wow. What a difference!!! Update Info: Monitor worked great for only eight months after purchase. Refused to power up.  Would not recommend Dell monitors to anyone. I am now giving it  a one star. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,"This item is very likely one of the many FAKEs being sold out there. Data moved onto it quickly disappears and gets corrupted.

1.0,DOA.
1.0,Dell Inspiron One is not Windows 10 compatible and Dell has no solution and announce not have time to look for one ! An International scandal please think about it before buying a Dell product !
1.0,"I've had the monitor for over a month now (unfortunately past the return policy time) and I have to say I hate it. During the first two weeks I owned it, it would occasionally flicker off when using it. It was annoying, but only happened once every few hours so it didn't stop me from being able to do work. I tried changing hdmi cables and computer settings to see if it was just going off from either of those - but the problem persisted.<br /><br />Weeks later, the monitor flickers off every fifteen minutes or so - making it impossible to work on. If at all possible, buy a different monitor than this one. And if your monitor has even the slightest problem out of the box, return it instantly - don't wait like I did. Now I'm stuck with this unusable thing."
1.0,"Drive arrived with a small screw in the sata connector, I don't see how this drive could've passed any quality control tests. See pics."
1.0,"No Schematic<br />No mention of what it gets powered with, though I did see 3 Vregs on the board (3? ).<br />None of which had their tabs soldered to the PCB!<br />Pins 9 & 10 of the IC have a solder bridge across them. Without a schematic, I have no idea if that was intentional<br />No SYSCLK pin brought out to the connector."
1.0,Broke within a week of getting them
1.0,"**Not as pictured** Purchased for a T420, requiring a round adapter, as shown in the product photo.  Received the product 8/28/15; not as pictured.  Square plug + round hole = waste of time & money"
1.0,4 differenet sellers 7 adapters not one lasts more than 1-2 months. The adapters cost more than the laptop. I have a hp 8504w
1.0,"I don't have time or space to outline all the problems with this piece of junk!  According to our contract, CenturyLink is to provide router. Will say CL have installed 3 in the last month--really 4 since the serviceman brought one new in box that would not even power up. Biggest nightmare is not only will it not stay connected, it will not reboot itself. so numerous times a week we are rebooting it. We have wireless security cameras in our house so when this piece of junk is off, so are they. And let's not even talk about Customer Service. They can't understand you and you sure can't understand them. But the biggest problem is that they LIE. Promises of different router, level 2 technician (whatever that is) and credit since we have not had internet service for half a month never comes to be.After a hour on phone (a weekly occurrence) last night and being switched to 3 different people, we got the &#34;expert&#34; that gave us a list of 4 other routers we could go buy that would work better! After researching, two are not compatible with CL system, one is for UK use  and one was $355. Centurylink's website has a long list of modern/router that can be used and not a one of these four were on the list. A JOKE!!!"
1.0,Operated fone for about 2 days. Then wouldn't charge over 2% and when off AC cord shut down after 5min use. Not a good product.
1.0,"Didn't work out of the box. I plugged it in and nothing, this has never happened to me with any router EVER! Therefore I guess this is not really a review but rather a warning to stay away from this product."
1.0,"In the five months since I purchased it I have used it 3 or 4 times.  Last night I wanted to use it again but it needed recharging -the red light was flashing. I plugged it in and checked it regularly but after 12 hours it still won't turn on without being plugged in.  The battery won't charge up.  When it is plugged in it will intermittently pair up and work.  It is unusable, which makes it a very expensive paper weight if I divide its cost by the number of times it was usable."
1.0,Holds a charge for about 10 minutes which is twice as long as the one it replaced
1.0,Did not work!!! Simple
1.0,"Neither controller worked at all. They feel nice in the hand, but wont pair no matter what I try.  I will have to wait over a week for replacements to arrive. I will update review if new ones work."
1.0,Totally devastated this card failed the very first time I used it. With irreplaceable images. Hours/days worth or work and destinations - all lost. Spent hundreds dollars to try to recover the images with no luck. Incredibly disappointed.
1.0,"Dead on arrival, and its been parked as a paperweight on my desk ....."
1.0,"I have a Macbook Air and this device stops working every 3-4 hours. You have to disconnect it and reconnect it. If you want to use it only as a short-term hub/ethernet connection it may work. I use it as both an ethernet connection and usb hub. If my MBA goes to sleep, the hub does not work when it comes back from sleep. It is a problem for time machine. I have another usb gigabit ethernet adapter that has been working flawlessly, so I know the issue is not with the MBA..."
1.0,Worked well for a short time then just stopped working. Save up for a better cable.
1.0,Within two weeks these cables no longer worked.  You will be safer purchasing this product from a known brand.
1.0,"This MicroSDXC card and SD adapter came in what looks like a genuine Samsung package and both the card and reader do at first look like they are genuine Samsung devices. I did not receive a card reader, but I do not need it anyway. I had a lot of trouble inserting the card into the adapter. I attempted to transfer 64GB of files to the card several times and the data kept getting corrupted. The transfer speed to write the files to the card was very slow, and then some of the directories to which I copied the files were empty. Some of the files on the card were okay, and others were corrupted and would not open. I ran a flash card test on the card and it shows that it has only 8GB of memory. I have started the return process. Update: After doing much research, unfortunately I have verified that this is a fake 128GB card that is actually a hacked 8GB card. The controller firmware inside of the card has been modified to show 128GB. The font on the card is not the same font as shown on the Samsung website. (See the attached pictures.) The write speed is about 7MB/s, which is the speed of an SDHC card. The write speed for a typical SDXC card is about 40MB/s. I am using USB 3.0 for data transfer."
1.0,"I didn't heed the other reviews online that talked about the problems with this computer.  I loved it at first, but then the USB ports stopped working after 4 months.  Dell customer support were not helpful... basically just went through the usual checklist versus trying to determine the problem.  They ended up sending a technician to my house and replacing the motherboard.  It didn't resolve the issue, but we rolled back a Windows 8 update and one of the ports started working again, so we lived with it.  Now, 12 months + 21 days after purchase, the video GPU failed and we need another motherboard.  Of course, Dell won't cover the cost because it is past the original 12 months, despite the actual motherboard being only 8 months old.  I've been in IT for 22 years and have never seen a more error prone product.  Be warned - you may get lucky and have no problems... or you may be like me and waste $1500 on a computer that has a high failure rate and a bad company behind it.  Such a shame to see how far Dell has fallen in terms of quality and support.  I'll never buy a Dell again.  If you do buy it, be sure to purchase the extended warranty... you'll most likely need it."
1.0,I never got the leopard it was a brown case
1.0,"Very cheap material, the top cover does not fit properly, the bottom part was cracked on the corner..."
1.0,"I bought mine from somewhere else, wish I would have bought it from Amazon because its easier to return things to Amazon.<br /><br />I had it 3 days. All of these people rating high must have gotten a different product than I did or mine was defective. I have over the years developed a preference for Netgear.  Every time I say to myself - &#34;that routers cheaper than the comparable Netgear one, lets just try it,&#34; I end up regretting it. My last Netgear Router I bought top of the line back in 2011. I am very happy with it. I figured this time I didn't really need top of the line, as the old router can handle it for the most part, I am just now running items that have the ac capability, but a router that doesn't. so I was looking for a few levels below top of the line, and figured I could save $50 over Netgear and go with this one. I have never tried TP Link before, but I figured the reviews seem to be okay.<br /><br />Well... that didn't happen. The 5ghz kept dropping out at random times (the whole reason I wanted a new router was for the ac and thats on the 5ghz freq.). I reset the router and it would come on, and a few hours later it would drop out again. Meanwhile the 2.4ghz network was working... but I certainly wasn't seeing the speeds of my old Netgear router. I run a lot on my networks and a lot of communication between devices, The only time I saw increases in speed over the old Netgear was when the 5ghz was working.  Then on day 3 both frequencies shut down. I dug through settings, thinking a Wake on LAN setting existed and wasn't set right (as I was using the network when it quit, this seemed unlikely). The layout was a little different than the Netgear I was used to and I was only learning the router so I kept thinking I was missing a setting somewhere. I work in IT, so I know routers, and computers, and I know often a setting somewhere can mess things up. I never found it. Meanwhile, the router started broadcasting SSID's that were not one's I created. I Suppose its possible that my neighbors bought a TP Link router at the same time I did (the SSID's all had TP Link in the name), and shut their router off when I shut my router off, but I find this unlikely. (My TP Link is off now and I am using my old Netgear again - no TP Link SSID's visible currently - I know its not full on scientific evidence, but its convincing enough for me that it was my router doing it. No I do not know why, never got the chance to investigate.)<br /><br />I noticed that the firmware version on the router was not up to date. &#34;Yay!&#34; I thought, &#34;a fix to my problems exists.&#34; So I matched up my router to the firmware and downloaded the newest version directly from TP Link's website. I loaded it up into the router. Let the router reset. That was the last time I was able to use the router. It came back on, it said based on indicator lights that it was broadcasting in both frequencies. And in fairness - I believe it was broadcasting a signal - but not for an SSID that I had created (Trying to connect to that one, it rejected my password, and the default password). Hooking direct to Ethernet to see what was going on, I got nothing. The router was shot. Thinking I had made a mistake, I double checked, nope, pretty sure that was the firmware I should have been using.<br /><br />In summary, I cannot recommend this device to anyone for anything except a paperweight. I really hope it was just defective, but my irritation with the router has led me to seek out a Netgear replacement, and I am sending the TP Link one back. $50 more is not worth this headache. I've never has issues with Netgear routers. I have been using them for years (in fairness, I have probably only owned like 3 Netgear routers because they last, but in between, I have owned, Linksys, Belkin, and now TP Link.) I would suggest you also spend the money, or ignore my warnings and try yourself. I really hope your experience with TP Link is better than mine.ssible that my neighbors bought a TP Link router at the same time I did (the SSID's all had TP Link in the name), and shut their router off when I shut my router off, but I find this unlikely.

And in fairness - I believe it was broadcasting a signal - but not for an SSID that I had created (Trying to connect to that one, it rejected my password, and the default password). Hooking direct to Ethernet to see what was going on, I got nothing. The router was shot. Thinking I had made a mistake, I double checked, nope, pretty sure that was the firmware I should have been using.  In summary, I cannot recommend this device to anyone for anything except a paperweight. I really hope it was just defective, but my irritation with the router has led me to seek out a Netgear replacement, and I am sending the TP Link one back. $50 more is not worth this headache. I've never has issues with Netgear routers. I have been using them for years (in fairness, I have probably only owned like 3 Netgear routers because they last, but in between, I have owned, Linksys, Belkin, and now TP Link.) I would suggest you also spend the money, or ignore my warnings and try yourself. I really hope your experience with TP Link is better than mine."
1.0,"Worked for 1 hour, then 4 hrs on phone with Linksys tech support to no avail.  Its going right back to the Target.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm a network professional, been working on networking equipment for 15 yrs.  I have an old dual band N router that I wanted to replace to take advantage of AC speeds at 5GHz.  So my research led me to buy this thing especially since it was rated as having the best range.  I own a 3 story home and my network equipment is in the lower level and I needed something that had good signal up to the 3rd floor, and this Linksys did for about and hour, then all hell broke loose.<br /><br />An hour after setting up my netowrk, I went to check my email on my iPhone and realized I had no internet connection, so I headed downstairs where my laptop and desktop are.  I checked both of those and the internet connection was down on them to so I realized it wasn't an isolated problem.  I was able to get from my devices to the router, but not through it to my broadband cable modem.<br /><br />It wasnt my broadband connection because plugging my laptop directly to the modem worked.<br /><br />After hours on the phone with tech support, with reinstalling firmware, and countless reboots, we were never able to get it working again and even the Linksys tech support guy was running out of things to try.  Finally, it was determined this thing is just wacked.  It will connect intermittently but 5 seconds later, its down again.  Now I spend $230.00 at Target for this thing and luckily their return policy is good.  So I'm taking it right back to them tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm done with Linksys!  Ive wasted about 5 or 6 hours of my life on this.  When I spend this kind of money on a Router, I expect it to last more than an hour."
1.0,Did not work for connecting a Lenovo Carbon X1 to a Seiki 39&#34; 4K display. After setting custom resolutions with the correct timing option (I had to use CVT-RB) it would connect and display at 4K but the signal would cut out about every 2 minutes. Super frustrating and disappointing. Had to return it.
1.0,"&#60;Standard would be less than one star if it could be&#62; I really tried to like this headset and when it was performing, I liked the quality of the sound ok. BUT. This headset loses connection. It loses it after  minutes, hours, you name it. I tried every driver fix, tried changing the manifest, changed the audio rate, changed my wireless router channel, reset the USB dongle. None of these fixes worked. There is really no answer from Logitech and now with the new headsets coming out, good luck getting any answers from them.<br />TL;DR Avoid this headset, it disconnects and you will want to punch a baby."
1.0,Piece of Garbage. Did not work the first time I plugged it in.
1.0,"Have had item for a little over a month unit works when it wants to. It has to be reset constantly! It is super annoying. I would like to just exchange it for one that will work, but of course I am out of the return policy!"
1.0,I  purchased this to replace one that is about 6 years old.  It didn't last a week.  My new computer was having problems and finally wouldn't connect at all. Other computer in the house also wouldn't connect to the internet.  Reinstalled the old router and everything works great.  The first 3 or 4 days everything worked.  I do not recommend this router.
1.0,Charged up the case and found that the QWE buttons did not work.  Asked for a replacement and when the replacement case came found that the QWER buttons did not work!  Complete piece of rubbish.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1.0,The cord is not a even 6 ft. It also will not charge the Cell Phone. Even though its cheap still not worth the  few dollars.
1.0,"Does not work already. Sparked last,time I plugged it in."
1.0,I bought this keyboard and mouse combination thinking that it will help me because of the ergonomic design. It turned out to be a waste of money. The mouse is too heavy - and it added extra stress to my right hand. the keyboard was not that helping either. settled down for the cheap default keyboard.
1.0,"not very loud, and the left channel crapped out after a couple months"
1.0,"Didn't work properly. I ended up having to buy a different, similar product."
1.0,"The Huion GT-220 is a great deal, but it's prone to breaking and costs at least $90 per replacement.<br /><br />This still costs half as much as the Cintiq alternative, but make sure you have an extra Franklin lying around or else you're SOL.<br /><br />The first issue you may encounter with this product is when you turn it on. The screen suffers a lot of LED light leaking in the corners - you'll see them lit up much more brightly than they should be when the screen should be displaying all dark. You will not be able to fix this without taking it apart and meddling with the insides, which voids the warranty. I wouldn't risk it.<br /><br />After that, if you're like me, the experience should be pretty good for a while. The issue is that this thing's shoddy craftsmanship means it's prone to breaking. After about half a year of sitting at my desk, the screen suddenly stopped working. It would turn &#34;on&#34;, as according to the light in the corner, but the actual display was busted and I had to replace the whole thing. That's $90 in shipping, and YOU have to pay for it.<br /><br />Not even a week after receiving my replaced/refurbished tablet, it breaks again. This time, it doesn't detect the pen<br /><br />Huion's customer support is pretty decent - I've had a lot of experience with them at this point. They're willing to work with you and respond to emails, but that doesn't mean you aren't paying out of pocket once you get them to admit the product's defective.<br /><br />If you're like me and have to save up half a year to afford it on a college budget - just know to keep saving after that first purchase."
1.0,falls out of plugs. Really annoying. Invest in a better quality one.
1.0,LED stopped working after about 2 weeks of use.
1.0,This product was not compatible with the charging USB unit on both of my PS3.
1.0,This gets so hot I can't hold it.<br />It's junk
1.0,Lost my pictures in 2 weeks!
1.0,Stopped working after 4 months real junk!!!!
1.0,"I ordered this cable July 7th.  August 27th, it stopped working to charge my phone.  I am not pleased.  Just over a month of functionality is not adequate.  I am very disappointed."
1.0,Not what is pictured (not ASUS brand) and did not fit the laptop it said it would in the description.
1.0,Did not purchase this item.
1.0,Does not fit Samsung 10.1 2014 tablet.  I should have believed the other review.  The cost to send it back is not worth it.
1.0,"Doesn't power/charge my iPad it's also not long enough to sit on the desk from an iMac, it just dangles there."
1.0,Bought two mine and a friends unfortunately mine came with a defective pen it won't work unless connected to the charger and from the reviews am not the only one. however the tablet works with my older 680s pen huion customer care simply will not respond to emails. its a good tablet for the price but due to quality control be ready to make returns until you get a good unit will update the review if customer service are able to help
1.0,I can not get it to work! I can not get any help from HP either! I think it -----.
1.0,Does not give enough power to get wifi in the basement! Not a super large home &amp; it's not powerful enough!
1.0,I bought this twice and twice it didn't work. Never buying refurbished again.
1.0,"Came as promised and installed on a 2009 Macbook in November 2012.  Worked like a champ, made the computer much faster along with the upgraded memory.  Was very happy until a week ago (Sept. 2015) when the drive completely crashed, nothing, nada. If I want the data that is on it i have to spend over 300$ and ship it to a data recovery company. I saved the old SATA hard drive, put it back in the mac, and i am using that for now.  I ordered a SATA hard drive to replace it.  I'm not sold on SSD memory, it will fail just like a regular drive, but when it fails, it is bad.<br />Think twice about the cost and the benefit."
1.0,"Purchased the product in June 2015 and just broke as of August 2015. Only lasted two months. It was used for gaming by a relative as a gift. It's beautifully presented the colors and design, however, I'm passed the 30 day return window and out of luck. It's affordable, and the colors are still working but that is it when plugged in. I can't move the cursor or anything else. A get what you pay for kinda thing. Either hardware quality not good enough or I just got a bad one. May be worth your purchase to see if it last longer."
1.0,this product comes up under bluetooth keyboard search for Galaxy Tab tablet but it doesn't have bluetooth.
1.0,"Poor quality, the camera is terrible, just a bad product"
1.0,"Battery dies, even after fully charge through the night"
1.0,Wifi would not connect.. Thank goodness for returns !
1.0,"If I could give it less than one star I would.  Constantly crashes anytime an application needs video power (heavier load).  Crashes in Photoshop, crashes playing games, sometimes crashes in plain Windows.  Type &#34;970 gtx crash&#34; and get 540,000 results.  And yes I updated chipset, BIOS, motherboard, Windows, Video Card drivers... I basically paid $340 for a video card that is less capable than a $50 one."
1.0,"Don't know how I would like this unit as it came to me DOA.  Following all manual instructions and fully charging the unit, I was unable to even power the unit on."
1.0,"The product I received seemed to be defective.  The connections were extremely loose fitting, causing devices to become unattached.  You could not even handle the hub without the connections losing contact with my computer.  My computer actually crashed twice with this hub attached.  The switches seemed pretty solid, but the USB connections themselves were pretty bad."
1.0,It did not fit my Kindle fire.
1.0,Doesn't fit snugly on keys impossible to get all it to fit right
1.0,The stand does not work on keeping the ipad in place. I would like to return this product.
1.0,Got these 10 days ago. Love the length for the car and for the outlets that are too far away. BUT I regularly get &#34;this device is not supported&#34; and cable shorts out if touched wrong. Within a month 2 of them are already busted. I am pulling out the 3rd one (shortest one) and expect it will also be broken in a week or two. I would NOT recommend this product.
1.0,Does Not work with Apple Time Capsule and Airport Express. Makes internet too slow...
1.0,"Total scam,<br /><br />Bought a 2 year plan with my Corsair K70 keyboard but I didn't buy the &#34;correct coverage option&#34; for spills. Spilled pop on the keyboard now I'm out $125 + what I paid for this &#34;protection plan&#34;.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you know exactly what it covers (nothing I guess?), otherwise it's a total waste of money."
1.0,did not charge at 2.1A.  My device support 2.0A charger.  Not worth it if anyone need a 2.1A charger with this USB hub
1.0,Fell apart ver quickly!
1.0,These chargers are not compatible with Apple products. A message appeared on our iPhone screens stating these devices aren't compatible.
1.0,"Don't Buy!!! Mine totally bricked with the 5.0.2 Android update.  Google support could not help; ran me through all the fixes suggested on-line -- clear cache, factory reset etc. etc.  Nothing worked.  Total waste of money."
1.0,5 feet from my modem/router and im getting dial-up speeds.  skip this one.
1.0,"Pros: My 11 year old son loved it for his iPad.  Great keyboard.  Looks cool.  Cons: It broke after being dropped 4 times.  It lasted 6 weeks.  So, if you think you will never drop this, it's the right product for you.    PS: I contacted the seller to see if we can get a replacement.  Maybe this one is a dud?"
1.0,"i am giving it one star,because I could not use it.I have a desktop and the cord is much too short to plug in to any of my ports. I ordered it because it is the same brand as I was using."
1.0,Broke right away
1.0,"Got here really, really fast!  I guessed when I first bought this that the $13 for this meant it wouldn't work. Money down the toilet. But in case it did, it would be a GREAT deal!  Got it (again, really, really fast!); plugged it in and charged it for 24 hours. No charge. None at all.  Attached it to another like computer and plugged that in for 24 hours. No charge. None at all.  $13? Yeah, not worth sending it back."
1.0,"The Kindle cannot survive a little fall, I've had it for about a month before it cracked. And a Crack isn't covered under the warranty"
1.0,I upgraded the firmware to the latest and also install the OS X 10.10.4 from scratch but no help at all.
1.0,"It worked long enough for me to get all of my music and shows on it, and then it stopped working. It will work for about 1 minute and then the computer thinks it's been ejected. I've tried it in every port and it has been a real tease.<br /><br />To be fair, my friend has one of the 64G of the same model and loves it, but I was not happy with the 256."
1.0,These are the worst charging cables I have ever purchased. All of them quit charging my phone and iPad within 3 days. Don't waste your money on this junk.
1.0,"I am currently writing this review with the microsoft touch keyboard because this stupid thing broke. I got it two days ago, and it started out wrking fine, and then it just stopped working. Do not buy this keyboard under any circumstance."
1.0,"Crappy plastic holder doesn't fit the tablet at all, the thing is completely worthless."
1.0,This product stinks. Not even able.to download adobe flash player even going thru ngeeks.com. doesnt show on tablet and the online textbooks wont work without the flash player. Even spent money on an app for flashplayer access still kothing. As cheap a tablet as price. Went from originally giving four stars to 1 waste of money!!
1.0,This is an inexpensive product that stopped working at just about 30 days after purchase.  Amazon says I am not eligible to return the product or even exchange it past 30 days.
1.0,"i received this product, plugged up to my Samsung Tablet and it does not charge.  Dont buy!"
1.0,Even though it stated it was compatible with my T43 the end connector was different.  I donated it to my recycling center
1.0,Seriously the worst laptop I've ever owned. I would recommend spending 100 dollars more to get something that actually works. It's VERY slow
1.0,"I used this hard drive for extra storage on my Wii U. It worked fine for about a year and then it just suddenly died. It doesn't power on any more and is no longer recognized by the Wii U or my computer, so I'm assuming all of my saved data is now gone for good. This isn't the first Seagate hard drive to die on on me, but I promise you that it will be the last."
1.0,"Disappointed to have received a MATTE/CLOUDY case instead of the &#34;glossy&#34; look as advertised. I chose this seller over the others due to the true clear shell others didn't seem to sell, but obviously this seller is no different. Other than false advertisement **for MBA13&#34; in CLEAR** shipment was fast & product fits well - TOO BAD IT WASN'T WHAT I HAD THOUGHT I ORDERED (perhaps for other MacBook models &/or sizes it's glossy & clear, but mine just wasn't) or I would've rated higher!  Update: I placed a 2nd order for the PURPLE case & this item came exactly as described! The issue seems to be only for the color &#34;clear&#34; for Macbook Air 13&#34;"
1.0,this is a joke!
1.0,"This drive was great, until it died. The power supply crapped out after a little over two years. A little research on the Internet showed that this is a common problem with this unit. The seller took several weeks to get back to me, then suggested I get a power supply on Amazon. I bought one and figured out how to install it (you better be handy to do this), and now it is back up and running. If this dies again, I am going to remove the internal hard drive and install it in a better drive enclosure.<br /><br />This was a great unit when it worked--it was easy to rip my entire CD collection onto the drive--but it simply isn't made for the long haul. I expected more for $450. Buyer beware."
1.0,nice flashy lights. Avoid cleaning with isopropyl alcohol. even with 70% damaged cheap plastic underside of keycaps
1.0,"Poor quality product. I thought I was getting a great deal, unfortunately the adapter did not work. No return = $5 I am never getting back.<br /><br />I would suggest finding another higher quality product that does actually work."
1.0,It has a has bad quality and it fell apart after a short time. I do not suggest this product at all.
1.0,"An ABSOLUTE PIECE OF CRAP... It's not what it looks like in the picture either.<br />1) After 3 months of use the ground prong on the black plastic power supply box came out and the power supply began quitting at random times fowling up my data transfers. The board or something inside is rattling around loose.<br />2) The power supply connector is junk. The brass connector sleeves molded into the plastic plug are not in the same vertical<br />position. Some are recesseed into the plug and some are sticking out as much as an eighth of an inch, and the pins on the plug are barely making contact.<br />3) The connector cable from the USB plug to the SATA HDD is thick, heavy and stiff and is difficult to curl into the tight space on the desk.<br />This whole piece of s*** interface was designed and built by slave Neanderthals with absolutely no quality control and absolutely no regard for their customers...<br />I hope somebody enjoyed their kimpchy and rice that my hard labor bought them with my purchase..."
1.0,Broke in 2 weeks
1.0,Not working properly.
1.0,Would not stay at correct date. Kept changing back to one day ahead.<br />Had to return
1.0,Does not work with any Apple products
1.0,"wrong part, does not fit, its not the same one as the picture, close but not the same.<br />just last 3 days of not able to use my laptop at work... no good!"
1.0,"Do not buy this router, Linksys support does not help you out with any technical help if you need beyond initial 30 days. After 30 days you are on your own, or you will have to pay more than price of router to get Linksys support to look into any issues with your router. I have this router and i do not get good speeds at all. Will be moving to a new router as this is not doing the job."
1.0,"dont buy this refurbished piece of sh#t. I bought this product on June 2015 and i m ordering a new mouse because it is not working properly. if you are looking for high quality Razer mouses, then DO NOT PURCHASE this one"
1.0,"Have had this for almost 2 months.  The camera takes very bad pictures. The speakers make a popping sound, even if all sounds are turned off through the device and whatever ap is used.  But the worst thing is the touch screen. It doesn't register/recognize a touch more than 50% of the time. Which leads to more proofreading due to misspelled words and games going bad because of that issue. Plus you have to look directly at the screen to see. Any angle at all and the image gets distorted to unviewable. I'm an honest consumer, not a rival or someone that wants to put products down.  But I also believe that the truth needs to be stated about a product."
1.0,"I purchased this thinking I was getting a genuine Fling, but after it scratched the screen quiet badly of my $400+ tablet I contacted the makers of the real fling, only to find out, mine was a fake... A cheap knockoff that was badly manufactured..."
1.0,"I bought this yesterday and it is way too slow, would not reccommend"
1.0,Had to return. Mouse would not respond.
1.0,Didn't work properly from the start. Many of the menus were in Chinese/Japanese/Korean and were unintelligible.  Deleted Apps reappeared when the phone was rebooted.  Would not stay connected or reconnect to known WIFI signals.  Finally went completely dead in the middle of a business trip so I had no communication with my office.
1.0,Didn't fit my tablet at all! Cheap!
1.0,Broke off in my PC within a week.
1.0,Do not buy this mouse it has changed software and is no longer able to program buttons. GIVE IT A MISS THIS IS A GARBAGE!
1.0,"The external itself feels very sturdy and well-made. However, the very first time I did a data transfer from my computer to the external, my computer made an automatic update and restarted during the transfer. Not all of the files got transferred to the external, and there was no trace of ANY of the files in my computer so that I could try transferring them again. The files appear to have been deleted off of my computer. Luckily, for these files, I believe I can re-download them from online storage and get them back, but if they'd been lost forever to me, I would be pissed. Please be aware. Edit: I left 3 stars originally, but now it's a 1. Shortly after I had written this review, the drive failed to be recognized on my Windows computer. I didn't do anything to it, I booted up my computer, attached the USB, and suddenly it won't open. The computer is also fairly new, so I do not believe issues from the computer are the problem. I did not buy this item for more frustration."
1.0,Wouldn't connect had to call 800 number and they conned me and gave my computer a virus
1.0,Not pleased at all keeps shutting my iPad off. Worked for a month then started acting up just when I couldn't get a refund.
1.0,"This did not work at all!  I tried it on Windows, Linux and OSX.  It's garbage.  For such a cheap price, I didn't even bother to send it back.  Don't buy it!  Get a reputable company's product."
1.0,No good
1.0,Didn't work!!  No customer service!  Waste of money!!  Sending back!
1.0,does not work
1.0,"This unit was delivered by USPS to the wrong address, but I'm used to that. The layers were wrapped in a saran type wrap and extracting it I broke the top clear layer. Super-glued it back together. Now once the glue dried I discovered that no provision was made in this case for the power connector. It needs much more of a cut-out to allow the power cable to actually fit properly, i.e. flush.<br />A poor design or I got a lemon. I do not like having to modify something to get it to work."
1.0,"Well, I bought this and it lasted about 8 hours.  I installed the Microsoft updates it said to.  Installed Evernote and Dropbox.  Then I noticed I had notifications in my taskbar that said I had to restart due to &#34;disk errors&#34;.  So, like a wise person I restarted.  That was all she wrote.  Will not boot, refresh, system restore, boot in safe mode - nothing.  Totally useless.  Called ASUS and they said its over for it and just send it back.  Wow."
1.0,"I purchased this keyboard to replace my old split keyboard thinking it was ergonomically suitable to provide relief from carpal tunnel.  It definitely is not.  Though the keyboard is slightly curved, it still keeps the hands too close together to provide relief from carpal tunnel.  The side buttons on the side of the mouse which allow for navigating forward and back are too close to the top/front of the mouse.  In order to reach the front/back buttons you have to reach far forward on the mouse, resulting in awkward placement of the hands on the mouse.  I'll go back to my very old Natural multimedia keyboard.  Microsoft really missed the mark on this one."
1.0,"I would not recommend this computer to anyone. I bought mine new yet it had problems from day one which never got fixed. It came that way too because I have never damaged it. I mailed my laptop to Lenovo repair twice in the first 6 months of owning it but they never actually fixed the problems. They tried to tell me I was out of warranty when I sent it to them 3 months after I bought it new! What a trick! I tried to like Lenovo and I gave the company every chance to keep me as a customer but I got nothing but bad repair jobs and poor communication from them, as if they never even opened the box but sent it right back to me. This machine is terrible, glitches all the time, suddenly turns off then won't turn back on, is very flakey if it wants to connect to my home wifi or not so I never know if I'll have Internet access, has problems saving documents, won't respond to clicks on icons, is very slow, is not user friendly, has a very confusing app layout and is not easy to figure out at all. It all around is the worst computer I have ever owned and I am switching to Mac permanently. Done with Lenovo."
1.0,"Delivered Aug 20, 2015<br />Logitech Wireless Headset H800 for PC, Tablets and Smartphones<br />Sold by: Amazon.com LLC<br />today is the 30th and it died, sound just went out in both ears and the mic also did not work. turned it off then on to see if that would work, then restarted my computer and neither worked to fixed the problem. im returning and sadly disgusted that Logitech allowed a defective thing like this to leave the factory"
1.0,After 24 hours of having this I am not happy with it. The key board constantly stops working followed by a USB driver malfunction. The memory is awful as if you have more than 2 apps running it bogs way down. Also my biggest complaint is it is advertised with 32gb of storage which is far from it. It has 23gb of storage and out of that only 12gb is available which makes upgrading to windows 10 impossible as 15gb is needed.
1.0,Worked for one day
1.0,Horrible screen quality.  Doesn't work well with PC.  Can't even use as a 2nd monitor due to weird screen reflection.
1.0,It hurts my ears!
1.0,Can't get it to work. It shows a signal but won't let you log on. Tried everything and so did several friends. Customer service was no help either.
1.0,Not happy the keypad worked for all of two weeks and now it doesn't work at all.
1.0,"I purchased two of these laptops for me and  my wife. I have purchased a plethora of goods in my 66 years of life and I have NEVER encountered this much difficulty trying to get these laptops to work or returned.  The vendor, expected me to contact Toshiba via the internet to address configuration issues, but I am not able to connect to the internet using these laptops. There are so many issues encompassing this purchase that I could never in good conscious recommend these products to anyone. I purchased these laptops on August 7th. Since then the product has been reduced in price by $100.00. I am not surprised!<br />."
1.0,Windows will not recognize this device. Don't buy.
1.0,I got worse reception than with the 3db antenna my wifi adapter came with.
1.0,Hooked it up and it would not connect. I now have to rebox it snd return it. Also I will now have to pay the $39.99 moving fee and $5.00 rental fee to my local cable company because I have to use there box until u get on that works
1.0,"Buttons kept falling off and I gave it away, so it would be someone else's problem."
1.0,"I gave it one star because it is not possible to give it zero!  This is the worst design for a case ever to be imagined! The reason z case such as this folds back on itself is so that it can stand up! But can it? No! It falls gracefully flat! Also, it has a 'feature' whereby you slot a side into a slit, but it dies not stay. Every time the case is moved slightly it falls out. The most irritating case I have EVER had, and this is my fourth Kindle. I will get another as soon as I have some spare money but as a sine parent, this was s treat for me. Seriously frustrated!"
1.0,Pretty funny.  They ship an empty box with no keyboard or mouse but a nice recyclable container.  Hopefully it was a mistake in which case I will update my post accordingly.
1.0,False advertisement. There are only 4 dpi settings: 1000-1600-2400-3200
1.0,"After 32 days of use, conveniently just after the return window, the space bar stopped working, rendering it useless.  Do not recommend."
1.0,"This cable assembly does not pair up with female conductor the tread, sleeve doesn't have enough depth to secure a solid connection and can not have been made to meet specs for my needs. THIS JUMPER IS GARBAGE AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IT COULD BE USED FOR."
1.0,"When I decided to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle to the Voyage, I opted to get the screen protector too. I have a screen protector on the original Kindle (which was much less expensive than this one) and it has a non glossy finish, so I assumed the one for the Voyage would be the same. (I should have remembered that old saying about assumption!) I like to read outside and this protector makes that nearly impossible. I feel as if I've thrown $30 right into the garbage.....which I suppose, in a way I have, since that's where I intend to put this product!"
1.0,"The sound modes are basically worthless. They can't be adjusted/changed, and there's only one setting that gets even close to producing decent sound, being Mode 4. I bought these specifically for gaming, but given the lack luster features and price, I'm disappointed with the purchase. To make things worse, after a a little over a year and a half of ownership, the headsets receiver has stopped working. You can't directly connect through a USB cable either, so now I'm stuck with a broken headset and no fix. As far as comfort, it's about a 2 or 3 on a scale from 1-5, 5 being the best. It's not quiet big enough to cover the ears completely/comfortably, so for long periods of use, it can be painful. The microphone is decent, but it feels in the way even when you have it in its vertical position. The Bluetooth feature is nice and works well. The automatic volume control during a phone call is very convenient. As noted by other users, and upon closer inspection, I noticed that the cheap plastic band has fractured on the left side. Even more frustrating is the fact that a year ago this headset was $200, now Turtle Beach is selling it for $124.95. You'll find better sound/features with alternative headsets. It's probably best to purchase a pair of high quality wireless headphones, and buy a mic separate to avoid the frustration of over paying for a poor version of each."
1.0,Does not work with Windows 7.
1.0,"Bought this mouth December 28th 2013. Within a year or less I was having mouse problems and no, I'm not very rough with my mice and I don't play PC games more than an 1-4 hours a day. I do click my scroll wheel a lot for scrolling and throwing grenades in games. But wow, this was my first expensive mouse purchase, I was previously buying microsoft intellimouse's and I loved how they felt and picked this one up after I heard it felt similar.<br /><br />It looked really nice, the side grips felt nice, side button placement was mediocre and makes it so your grip must be altered to properly keep your thumb ready to click both side buttons. The mouse buttons themselves are really weak and have that single connected piece of plastic style, where the plastic simply curves over the mouse sensors, I always hated these but the Deathadder had good reviews so I decided i'd give it a chance. Well, mouse buttons suck, again, barely a year since I bought this and the mouse buttons double click at times, the scroll wheel simply does not work at all and has a 10% chance of working if I press down on it hard as hell.<br /><br />Not only this I found this to be a common issue. I'm really disappointed as I thought I was paying more money for the Razer brand because it had a good reputation when this mouse was first released. I didn't think it would just amount to cheap crap."
1.0,drive failed with irreplaceable files on it.  WD does not cover recovery - even under warranty. I would only use this for transferring large files between computers or for files you don't care about.
1.0,Received broken returned for different brand.
1.0,"This protected the screen I suppose, but got so scratched up right away I couldn't see through it"
1.0,One of the RAMs  was defective. My computer started giving me issues shortly after a week. I went to apple store for a checkup where they told me that your RAM was defective.
1.0,if you search the word &#34;Pesen&#34; you will notice that the seller was using another storefront until consumers discoverd this card is a counterfeit with half or less storage space. I did purchase and test this item and can confrim that it only has 40GB of usable space. Don't buy this product.
1.0,"After installing it on my laptop, I can get good reception to 12 ft on the clear, ie if I place my laptop in my hallway and stay within sight.<br />This shows there is some extended range.<br /><br />However, my laptop is typically docked and at the edge of my table. In this position, reception is only about 5 ft. Reception is intermittent<br />when I move side to side.<br /><br />My laptop's built in bluetooth has better coverage for close range, ie up to 6 ft, so I get no benefit from the Class 1 capability."
1.0,Absolutely the worst wireless keyboard and mouse. Constantly loses connectivity and lags.<br />I bought a brand new Dell and bought this combo to go with it. I've had it for 3 weeks now and can't stand it. Junking it.<br />Don't waste your time and money on this product.
1.0,This item is was poorly made the connection was a press fit and it didn't have any reinforcement. It is not worth the money we only used it a couple of times and the knob pulled out of the frame.
1.0,"After reading the reviews which referred to this item being easy broken, I thought that perhaps others may be too aggressive with the cable.  No, I was absolutely wrong.  It didn't take much to crack the plastic encasing the portion which plugs into the phone.  It just cracked in half and it wasn't salvageable with some electrical tape either.  Terrible item and a waste of my money! DO NOT purchase this item."
1.0,It is GARBAGE DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1.0,Device does not work.  I will return it today
1.0,"Cannot recommend.  Questionable quality. Questionable software/automatically downloads ads/apps/viruses UPDATE NOV2015: I purchased the E97 Tablet in August 2015 and have used it VERY lightly since then. It lasted 2 months exactly- then I connected it to the charger on my desk with a surge protector  (I have probably charged it a total of 7 times and did the full 8 hr charge when I first received it) for about 5 hours and now IT DOES NOT WANT TO TURN ON nothing else has happened (it has not fallen or been sat on etc., the screen is new, I always keep it in the keyboard case). I've tried pressing the power button for several seconds and connecting and disconnecting the charger with no result. Was working fine (though of course with the mal ware- had to uninstal trojans Linervice and Broservice every time I connected to internet). CUSTOMER SUPPORT for TABLETEXPRESS is very disappointing-they respond to emails at 1am Eastern time and only Amazon was able to really help me"
1.0,"Does not fit latest Kindle Paperwhite (300ppi), too big."
1.0,Worked fine at first. Noticed it getting a little slow. Download speed a week ago was 1.24. Today it was 0.49...The download speed on my phone while sitting right next to my computer is 10.31. Tried it on a different computer with the same results. Wish I could still return it...
1.0,"Extreamly hard to install,"
1.0,Not happy with the case. Thought it would be thicker and front of case would have better protection. Front of case only will protect against scratches.
1.0,Bought this converter to take with on a vacation to Iceland. My wife tried using it for the first time with her hair dryer plugged into it. The hair dryer began to run at a very unnaturally high speed before a popping noise occurred in the converter and our entire hotel room lost power. The converter was either faulty or couldn't handle being plugged into a hair dryer and had shorted out and caused the surge in power which flipped the breaker in the hotel room. Afterwards the converter smelled like smoke and was very hot to the touch. Once it cooled down it went straight into the trash. I would recommend buying a higher quality converter if you want to do anything other than charge a battery.
1.0,I have been unable to contact the company regarding the lifetime warranty.  Cable has split and is no longer usable.
1.0,"Most of these positive reviews are DEFINITELY written by paid reviewers (who did not receive the NAS in exchange for their reviews). Just look at the other reviews written by these alleged reviewers, and you'll see nothing but glowing reviews for products (with some negative for books thrown in, to cover things up), and some of those products are the same, like the iWatch stand that almost no one on this planet owns, yet is glowingly reviewed by multiple people who just happened to also review this NAS.<br /><br />I cannot stand deception like this - it is so offensive. This is not a terrible product, but it's obviously an uphill battle for a Chinese company trying to make their own OS to compete with established companies, and this is not the way to do it. Screw you, TerraMaster - stop it, or continue to be called out on it. Your product obviously has some serious problems, based on the few real reviews here, and is not ready for foreign markets."
1.0,"Please do not but this prodcut.  They don't work.  They never fully charged product.  It completely broke within 5 months.  This is not an authorized Apple dealer, you have no warranty.  Go to apple store don't waste your money!"
1.0,The wifi and picture quality were both poor.
1.0,did not work for product it was purchased for
1.0,"This battery unfortunately worked for a few days, then it just died. I was very disappointed."
1.0,THIS CABLE DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I GOT NO AUDIO SOUND FROM MY OLDER 30 PIN BOOM BOX..
1.0,"This product is defective as well. To much trouble trying to have to return things. Hard earned cash payed. then when it doesn't work the hassle of getting refunded sucks. I still have it however, the product let me down because it came from overseas. Followed charging procedure that came with the product It never held a charge as a new product. Still have it but un-usable."
1.0,Neither camera hole is cut correctly. I have to take it out of case to do so. Don't waste your money!
1.0,"Purchased in Oct 2014.  Worked fine for 6 months and then wouldn't hold charge for very long.  Macbook also give &#34;service battery&#34; warning.  Price felt too good to be true, and it was! Lesson learned!  Spend the money for the real deal."
1.0,"I have used this cable about once a month since I received it. A little over one year after purchasing, it does not work anymore. Disappointed."
1.0,My son has had this headset for about a month and they broke. Very disappointed.
1.0,Some keys stopped working on the qwerty row of the keyboard a few days after I received this product.
1.0,"I started to leave a negative review of this laptop when it froze completely. It does this EVERY day without fail! So I suppose there is a method to Acer's madness. Can't leave a bad review when your PC doesn't work. The mouse pad is also horrible, sometimes it will take you in the vicinity of where you want to click but only when it feels like it. I could go on...Suffice it to say I will never buy another Acer product again. It's a piece of ju You'd never be able to use it for work or school because it's so unreliable. Extremely frustrating."
1.0,Did not do a thing.
1.0,So I purchased this because if its amazing reviews.. And now 2 days after the return policy expires it completely stopped working. It will not let me retrieve nor load anything else on it. Total waste of money.. Be sure to read all the reviews not just the first few who give it four stars
1.0,"Doesn't work freezes once plugged it . I need to return it when I can find the time, must be defective"
1.0,Very cheap and bad product. It doesn't stay on my MacBook Air keyboard and it comes off when i blow air :(((
1.0,Stopped working after few months.
1.0,Both the outer cover and the keyboard cover broke within a month! I am very disappointed with this product. It gets one star because it arrived rather quickly.
1.0,Terrible tablet! Malfunctions more then it stays on and works properly.
1.0,I was looking forward to this as I wanted to play a could casual games on my nexus player. It came in a timely fashion. Packaged well. The controller is very nice. But.... Will not connect to my Nexus Player. I tried several time. Had a friend that is very techy try it. But no matter what. It will not connect. Like to give it 5 stars. But with the fact that I can not even use it. One. Maybe I just got a bad remote. :/
1.0,You know when you turn off a device it should save the battery life... Well not this each time i do the battery is dead.. What am i to do now it wont charge
1.0,My batter died in about a months time. As the month went on the battery progressively held less and less charge until it no longer held a charge. So the laptop only worked with the charger plugged in. So I'm now buying a new battery. Would not recommend this or any knock-off brand charger. They probably aren't regulated and fry the battery.<br /><br />Laptop: Asus X53U model<br />Li-Ion Battery Pack A32-K53 (specs: 10.8V 5200mAh 56Wh.)
1.0,After installing product we had nothing but issues with our internet. We continued to blame Comcast we later found that this modem had already been assigned to someone else in another service area.  They deemed that the modem was defective and we are now out the money.
1.0,"Has not worked from day 1.  Accepts a few files, then gives an error message that the files are not found.  Formatting the disc helps for about 2 minutes, then the same problem reoccurs with a different file.  Had very good experience with smaller capacity Kingston memory sticks in the past, have been using them for years.  But this one is getting returned to Amazon."
1.0,"really if there is  less one star  i have to give you  guys ,  your product is a very bad product ,  the flash  give different sizes each time i plug it in, when i format it  it wont work anymore , i contact you  and  you just ignore me , any one want to buy this product  please do not ."
1.0,"Wired connection is working supremely with almost 100 mbps. But, wifi is pathetic. After 3 minutes my wifi shows, no connection. They I restart the connection and after that I will get connection for another 3 minutes."
1.0,"Very complicated to configure new drives, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Was spending a lot of time with their (relatively useless) phone support and figured out myself how to do it.<br />The unit does not work with four 5 TB drives, made it work with four 4 TByte.<br />It is slow, takes forever to boot up. The web interface suchs."
1.0,"This is a piece of junk. Great idea, but very poorly made. After a little over 2 months of minimal use, the brittle plastic is breaking off and the hinge is impossible to use as other reviews note. Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. Several of us at work purchased these for our work iPads and they all have had problems. Now I find out that I cannot contact the seller and this cover has been discontinued. Lesson learned to pay more attention before purchasing something this expensive."
1.0,Didn't fit and the first one i got was no good.
1.0,This is total crap. It should have negative stars. It is fake and put my computer into seizures as it tried to reconcile with the graphics card. Thank god I tried it the day before I needed to use it so I could go to an Apple store and get the real deal.
1.0,"Has awful smell, so strong I had to return it.  It smells like a lot of rubber products out of China. I bought two, and they both had the same issue."
1.0,"Very disappointed. The WiFi card had issues. The signal was so weak I had to stand next to the router to use it and even then I barely have one bar. I called dell support and have been on the phone for over an hour. The technical support agents tried updating drivers and the bios but no help. I am extremely disappointed in this product and do not recommend it. Others seems to have no problems so maybe it is hit or miss, but when you miss it is terrible and not worth the risk."
1.0,It's not working and when it is connected to the computer almost caused fire<br />I would not advise them
1.0,It does not work waste of money
1.0,"Don't waste your time or money.  Diminished range, numerous dropped connections, and had to keep entering the wireless password into all apple products over and over.<br /><br />First tech support call:  about an hour of troubleshooting and tier 1 support determined that the router must be defective so they shipped me another.<br /><br />2nd tech support call:  another hour of troubleshooting, consultation with tier 2 tech support to determine that my ONT equipment was not compatible with the quantum router.  Verizon scheduled a dispatch to replace my ONT.<br /><br />3rd tech support call:  new ONT installed.  Same issue as before.  Apple products (iPhone6, two iPad2 airs) only received about 25mbps downstream and about 2.7mbps upstream.  red and router was much faster with greater distance.  I also pay extra for 75Mbps down and up so really wanted to take advantage of the Verizon Quantum gateway hype.<br /><br />So I'm out $200, and the damn device makes a great door stop.  Never again Verizon, never again.  This kid is shopping around for a better service provider."
1.0,screen was inferior. you can see the lines in screen when you turn on laptop
1.0,total junk
1.0,Complete waste of money. Amazon should stop marketing these cables. They don't work. Read the other one star reviews. I won't waste anymore time talking about this bad product.
1.0,Broke second time I used it
1.0,Not what I thought I was ordering. Super short cord
1.0,"The battery was so old it would not a charge.  After charging it would show low battery and not turn on.  Returned first one and ordered a second, same problem with both."
1.0,"This is the biggest rip-off ever.  It may be waterproof, but could not get the air bubbles out from between the two screens."
1.0,didn't work.  three people read the directions and coulnd't get it to worok
1.0,"***** UPDATE 10/14/2015  Stopped working after 1-1/2 months. . .Worked great for my application until then -- Dropped my Rating to 1 Star from 5.  ALSO -- Notice how incredibly many reviews are for a free (or discounted) product - The manufacturer would make sure THOSE worked.  My paid-for one didn't work long. *****<br /><br />BUT YOUR RESULTS MAY VARY depending on circumstances.  --I didn't know these USB/network cable adapters existed until I recently saw and bought them while battling to get the longest USB cord distance possible for my wireless network adaptor without so exceeding the USB standard that the thing failed to work.  My understanding of the USB standard is that a 16 foot cord should be the max. without adding a powered hub.  I found that 25 ft. (using 15 and 10-foot extension cords together) worked fine with my network adapter (I guess the adapter doesn't take much power and the USB signal is robust enough for the distance) but I wanted longer.<br /><br />I bought these adapters (which seem well made and tough), made-up a 50-foot Cat5 network cable, connected everything and the network adapter works fine at the end of it.  And making one's own network cables is dirt-cheap compared to USB extension cables, which seem to max out at about 15 feet anyway.  The network cable is tougher, too.  I use a freeware wireless-signal-strength analysis program to check the network adapter's performance and the signal delivered over the cable to my computer reads strong and efficient.<br /><br />The only thing is these adapters hark back to the old, slow USB 1.1 standard so what one gets with today's USB 2 and 3 probably is a guess.  USB devices requiring more power than my network adapter or sending weaker signals to the computer might not work well.<br /><br />The bottom line is, for a given length of network cable attached to these USB adapters and a given attached USB device -- If it works...then celebrate. . .if it doesn't work, too bad."
1.0,"This car charger for some reason won't work with my iPhone 6. It brings up a msg every time saying that it's not compatible. The only way I can get it to work, is if I use the lightning cord that came with my phone, and through the USB port. This was disappointing"
1.0,stop working
1.0,"My computer wouldn't recognize the first battery I received.  The seller replaced the battery, and the second battery worked well for about 3 months.  It has now stopped working.  I'm willing to try a third battery, but not sure how to contact the seller since I'm past Amazon's return policy.  Based on the current track record, I don't have high hopes for the third battery to work."
1.0,As soon as I installed the battery my computer sent the message that I should replace the battery.  The battery holds a charge for about an hour.
1.0,"Purchased two and both broke in the exact same way, just after the 30 day return period. Plastic hinge is not durable."
1.0,"It stopped working. And since it says lifetime warranty, I tried contact Netgear, and they said they cannot offer warranty since I did not have the purchase receipt ( of course I did not and do not keep every store receipt for every product I purchase) even though I have the product with S/n, mac address...etc. I have attached a photo of the exact model number if it helps for anybody to not buy the same model.<br /><br />For benefit of doubt, Probably the one I got is defective, and everybody stores all the receipts of all the products ever bought."
1.0,I get the table is used me I'd like to change it for a new
1.0,randomly turns off/on
1.0,Very cheaply made.I know I only paid $6 for it. But it didn't last more then  mins.
1.0,Purchased on Prime Day and haven't been able to get it to work since. I plugged it into various USB ports and I couldn't get Windows 7 to recognize it at all. I even tried it on multiple laptops and computers to see if it was an issue with my personal desktop. Probably makes sense why it was so inexpensive. I would go with a more reputable company instead of an off-brand one.
1.0,Battery failed.  Bought new battery.  Battery failed.  System would not charge battery.  Took 32 days to find this out.  Cannot return after 30 days.  Computer shop wants to charge me $300 for repairs.
1.0,"Battery did not work,  I return it"
1.0,"This keyboard absolutely does not work with Windows 10 tablets.  Windows connects and pairs with the keyboard successfully, but then immediately drops it and starts to reconnect again.  Downloaded new drivers, tweaked bluetooth and power settings, -- I even cleanly reinstalled Windows -- nothing works.  This is really surprising, since preview versions of Windows 10 have been available to hardware developers for a very long time (since 2014), so it never occurred to me that this would not support Win10... especially since it unambiguously advertises &#34;Compatible with the windows system Bluetooth-enabled tablets&#34; in the description.  On another sour note, this is a pretty bad implementation of keyboard functionality -- there is no page up or page down, for example.  They already have a Function (Fn) key on there, and it controls the media commands, so there is no reason not to include those basic features.  Sloppy.  As a final negative, the On/Off button is under the keyboard, very small, and actually really difficult to switch since it's recessed.  Other wireless keyboards have it on top and easily accessible, which is a just an obvious design choice that this keyboard gets completely wrong.  Wasted half a day on this.  It's going back."
1.0,Would not work with comcast
1.0,It will only connect to my iPod 7 for a few seconds. IdeaUSA says it might not be compatible with the Ipod 7. That would have been nice to know before I invested in them. Buy at your own risk.
1.0,look awkward.
1.0,This didn't last.  I had to buy a new one already.
1.0,Did not fit my Kindle Fire
1.0,Garbage. I bought 2 tablets. Both screens went black and unresponsive within one week. Waste of time and money. You get what you pay for.
1.0,"this laptop case cracked and broke, the bottom half was constantly sliding off and did not stay on. the case was not dropped, the hooks that keep the case on the laptop just snapped off within a week of buying it."
1.0,I like the case but the hole for the camera is in the wrong spot above the screen
1.0,Bluetooth sucks unless you are a ignorant
1.0,"August 2015, does not fit a PSP1000."
1.0,"The most useless bug infested device I have ever wasted money on.<br /><br />You will spend countless thousands-of-hours to get this thing to work and it will crash your monitors, scramble your video and freeze your computer.<br /><br />Worst of all, the unit runs very hot.  So hot, that you can barely touch the side.  You have to be careful  not leave any papers or combustible material touching the side of the unit or you could have a fire at your desk."
1.0,"This is definitely a fast boot drive.  My problem is that my M.2 died after less than 3 months of use.  This is the shortest time frame I have ever had a drive break before.  Obviously, this is a sample of one.  ymmv<br /><br />Please be warned, these drives run hot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hhdWwvh5kI"
1.0,5G did not work. Returned it for refund.
1.0,"I was looking for a case that my child could easily carry and that would protect the kindle from impact if she dropped it. That it does. Unfortunately, the case is extremely thick and the hole for the headphone very small, so it is almost impossible to plug them in. Also the buttons to turn it on and for volume are so hard to push that I have trouble doing it, so my little daughter stands zero chance no matter how hard she tries. So if you are OK with your kid not being able to turn the device on, adjust volume or plug in her headphones I guess this case might work for you. For me that kind of defeats purpose. And I go crazy trying to plug in the charger through the little whole in the thick case. Poor design in that regard. The impact protection is good, but other than that I find it disappointing."
1.0,"No green confirmation light, waste of money."
1.0,Stopped working on my iPad and iPhone after a week.
1.0,"I don't understand how it says MacBook Pro 13 case, but then says not for MacBook Pro 13. That's stupid. I got my refund tho."
1.0,Does not work most of the time on my new iMac computer.  Have to unplug it and plug it back in each time I want to use it.  And most of the time it won't allow me to insert a disc anyways.  Wasted my money and waited to long to return it for refund.  Do not buy for a Mac.
1.0,It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
1.0,Worse than antenna 1/4 the size.  Totally not worth it.
1.0,"Honestly I was expecting what the description says and I am so dissatisfied. The PC claims to be a gaming pc but for heroes of the storm which is not a very demanding game, I have to put everything on low and it still has issues keeping up. The keyboard has some keys that take a few times to press to work and its brand new. I was lured in by the stats but I question that those parts are even in this machine because it is not running what it says its suppose to. Would return it if I was able to. Go to best buy and get an asus vivo book instead this one is not worth the money."
1.0,I bought 2 of these and had them a few days now and thay are junk thay don't download apps well and thay freeze up like several times a day I recommend buying somthing better like the old folks say you get what you pay for and that is the truth these will be sent back Monday morning.
1.0,Don't buy this .I think the positive reviews have to be bs.I down loaded the software for the Samsung note and a pc.It sounds just as bad on both.This thing is horrible do not buy.Yes I have the HD model junk.
1.0,Bad quality product. Had scratches and scuff marks. I do not recommend this.
1.0,"Waste of money ... cheap, moves around, difficult to use.  :o("
1.0,"GIGABYTE GA-H97N-WIFI motherboard failed after 10 months. Product includes 3-year warranty, one of the reason for my purchase. Very common problem with Gigabyte motherboards, according to Google. Warranty policy essentially requires customers to pay additional fees in order to receive warranty repairs. Called their customer care. Chuck Liu (service manager), Maggie Lin (warranty manager), Gary Tam (operations manager) all stated that the policy of requiring customers to pay additional fees to receive warranty repairs cannot be changed. Gigabyte is making defective products and selling them for profit. Attempts to have Gigabyte honor their warranty guarantee without additional charges have failed.<br /><br />Avoid Gigabyte at ALL COSTS! Unreliable products and horrific customer service. Their motherboard failed. Their warranty is more expensive than it looks. Total cost = retail price + retail shipping + cost of recovering data + cost of shipping to RMA center + cost of replacement motherboard. Just talked for over an hour to Chuck Liu, their service manager in CA, Maggin Lin, warranty manager, and Gary Tam, operations manager. According to Gary, he's the one running the whole US Gigabyte division. No one at Gigabyte can offer a truly no cost warranty. If your Gigabyte product breaks, you'll need to pay at least shipping to get it fixed. Do not take the chance with Gigabyte products. Gary hung up on me in the end because he had &#34;better things to do.&#34;<br /><br />Paid out-of-pocket and sent the motherboard in for &#34;free&#34; warranty. After Gigabyte received the package, they sent me pictures of the board coming apart in one corner. The board was wrapped in multiple layers of bubble wrap for shipping. It's physically impossible for it to sustain such damage during shipping, especially when there's no indication of the outer packaging being damaged. Highly suspect that Gigabyte intentionally damaged the board to avoid dealing with &#34;demanding&#34; customers. Then they trashed the board that I bought, not even bothering to send it back. Could have used it for target practice or hung on the wall to remind all my clients of how bad Gigabyte is.<br /><br />I've been in tech support field for over a decade. Gigabyte really perfected the art of treating its customers like garbage. 2nd to none."
1.0,not a good quality one.. i bought is few months back and now its gone .. can't charge my phone ..its gone bad now..
1.0,"The hard drive completely fried in one day (no exaggeration).  All data were lost.  The drive would not even mount.  It made awful noises when I tried.  Looking through the reviews afterwards, it seems I'm not the only one with this experience.  I've had dozens of hard drives over the past 25 years and I usually chase a good price not worrying much about performance.  Thinking back, I realize I've had a lot of Seagate drives fail one way or another.  Although, they have never failed this quickly and catastrophically."
1.0,i ordered this product because it said it was for my laptop that i own and it is not the right size for my laptop i have the hp notebook and thats what it says in the title and it does not fit the charger was way to big to fit in the hole and i am now late on my vlacs classes because i thought i ordered the correct charger but it is the wrong one
1.0,"Latching mechanism is Junk, broke of in a few months of little use."
1.0,Do not buy this....it will not eject the cd or dvd....I can't wait to tear this thing apart to retrieve my cd.....got what i paid for I guess....
1.0,Disappointed. Said they were compatible with iPhone. It worked a week and now stopped working.
1.0,"The charging port works fine, is a little bit loose. The audio port never worked. I took it apart again and looked at it and all the solder points were broken, so the port just moves up and down because it is not connected to the board."
1.0,Crapped out on me after a year.
1.0,These did not fit my ipad.
1.0,Doesn't charge my devices!
1.0,"I bought this laptop and was super excited. I received it and was even more excited. I have never had any problems with Amazon. That is until now!! I noticed after setting up this laptop something just wasn't right. I had problems with some of the apps not opening, the screen would get stuck between desktop mode and tablet mode, and the apps that were already loaded would not update giving errors. And this was before I tried updated to Windows 10! Well I picked up the box it came in for whatever reason, and I noticed there were 2 stickers or labels more like that were placed on top of one another and became curious. I decided to remove the top label so I could be able to read the information on both of them. I am really glad I did, and became very angry after doing so. The top label read; &#34;2015 Newest Dell Inspiron 15...tooth / Windows 8.1 / Silver New&#34;. This is the description I read before ordering, and that I have in my order review. Well then I read the label the that was for some reason being covered up by the first. It read; &#34;Dell Inspiron 15 i5548-4167S...lver (Certified Refurbished) New&#34;.  Well, at least now I understand why there were problems!! That's also apparently why there was such a big discount. I will be ordering another Dell, but this time it will be from Dell!"
1.0,"Total piece of junk failed in 26 days. DO NOT BUY. This is such a pile of crap that it is so poorly thought out and built, that when it fails, you will have to make the decision to break it open to save your discs. Not only did the drive itself fail in a couple of weeks but the cord is attached to the USB plug so poorly that I had to use Gorilla Tape to force the plug to stay straight so that it would not just snap off. Total garbage."
1.0,"Static noise in the left ear piece. I tried every remedy recommended on the support forums at Logitech. I usually would recommend Logitech to everyone (I've used their keyboards and mice for years, and continue to this day with the G710+ and G700s) but I sadly can not recommend this. I've read other reviews before warning of this problem, and I encountered it myself. Sad that Logitech still hadn't fixed the problem by the time I bought it."
1.0,Data cables worked as advertised. The power supply was a different story. I tried using it on two separate 3.5&#34; Seagate drives. Neither would spin up. The power supply nameplate ratings are 12 volts at 2 amps and 5 volts at 2 amps. A quick search yielded the drive specs. The drives need 2.8 amps peak at 12 volts to spin up.  I scrounged an old AT power supply to solve the problem. DO NOT buy this if the supplied PS is your only source of power to the drive.
1.0,No . It did not meet my expectations. It didn't work at all. No adhesive came with it as I was told it would.<br />I would not buy it or recommend it.<br />RR
1.0,horrible shipping awful experience
1.0,"I have a Macbook air 11'', and I got the 12'' sleeve, because I think it may leave some space for accessories. When I tried it just now, I found it DOES NOT FIT AT ALL! This sleeve is TOO SMALL. I can barely put my mac air in it but can't close the bottom on top. It's even worse that I had to ask my husband to help me and pull the laptop out, because it was too tight and didn't fit. After reading the reviews I found this size really varies. I have to return this, and don't even want to have an exchange."
1.0,"after one year of having this tablet, I lost access to the D drive that in the keyboard unit. Now, I lost a lot of stored files and I am limited to the space in the tablet."
1.0,No good
1.0,at first battery worked well enough as i got 2 to 3 hours of use. after only a few months it only lasts 45 to 60 minutes. I only use it occasionally so it is disappointing.  i do not recommend it.
1.0,Three pack and two did not work (device not supported... blah blah blah)<br />Am returning for refund.
1.0,"Died after less than two years, won't turn on. Google search shows this is a pretty common problem."
1.0,"It does not charge my kindle like the original-this is the 3rd one I've purchased and it doesn't reliably charge it=I specically bought one that it was a replacement.  The original  cord broke loose from the wire at the connection end to the pad,  It still works sometimes.  My grandaughter  misused it soon after I purchased it and it tore loose-that was our fault I did not blame the pad,but I haven't hadany luck with any of the replacement chargers."
1.0,"I normally don't write reviews but I want to inform people on the issue I was having with this item. If you try to get raw images off of a SD card from this thing it just screws it up. First it takes way too long to load. Another reviewer mentioned 3.0 is not supported by Mac and that's that issue I believe I ran into. However, it corrupted all my files that it loaded on my computer. I used another add reader then and all the files that were loaded on my computer were corrupted from this card reader. So frustrating.  Glad I stopped loading the files part way through. Save yourself the headache and get something better if your working with RAW files on a Mac."
1.0,Charger didn't work on arrival. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it so I just bought one at my local electronics store. It did arrive in a speedy fashion though.
1.0,"This product is advertised as compatible with any laptop, which is not true. Now I am stuck with a product that doesn't work because it's too expensive to send it back. I would expect a free replacement from the seller for one that actually works."
1.0,"Bought this power supply for our daughter who depends on her laptop for textbooks and assignments at college. Six days past return window, the thing started smoking and sparking at the connection between wall outlet and power box."
1.0,"Piece of junk, purchased two, have tried on three different operating systems and PCs and they just does not work.<br /><br />Do not waste your money"
1.0,Modom did not last a whole year!! After 3 months it refused to connect to two different routers at different times. Don't waste your money.
1.0,"This laptop would not allow me to download anything, not even adobe.  Was not able to access the search engine &#34;Internet Explorer&#34;"
1.0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED, IT IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD AND THE PORT IS LOOSE AND IT WON'T CHARGE. I PURCHASED A 64 GB AND SPENT MORE ON IT, THINKING IT WOULD LAST ME A LONG TIME.  NOW I HAVE TO REPLACE IT. I was offered a $15 dollar discount on a replacement which amounts to $11 less than I originally paid."
1.0,"It stopped working after a week of using it, i have to have the wire straight and it will work, the wire will just cut out after a while."
1.0,"I bought this disk to be used as an external recording disc for my Mac book air, it is advertised as having a fast read time but I didn't even get sufficient speed to operate; it didn't even give 60 MB/s speed. The drive caused hiccups in the recording/playback so much so it couldn't serve my original purpose. Sandisk should advertise reality and not optimal. Great design but terrible execution; I wasted my money. I would like to see this disk at least provide 60 MB/s read/write time."
1.0,"the case I received does not click onto the MacBook in some areas. also, there are multiple dark scratches that are terribly visible on the gold MacBook. I will be returning this shortly and getting a Kuzy case."
1.0,This has got to be one of the worse controllers I've came across in years. I got this one from Gamestop and within a week the right thumb stick got stuck in the up position. It looks like a spring must have broken in it. Best to get the sony version while they still make them because this is  some shhhhh it!
1.0,The connection to my computer is terrible.  The battery would be fully charged but it wouldn't be able to charge to my computer before losing the connection.  I've never gotten it to use its full battery charge.  I was traveling for many weeks so missed the return deadline.  :(
1.0,"This device has limited functionality and its use is far from intuitive.  Many apps available on other tablets simply are not available on the Kindle Fire.  If you consume Amazon content and Amazon content only, then this device is fine. But if there is any other type of content you wish to consume--even if there is an app for it on the kindle fire, you'll find that it runs poorly and with difficulty.  I am returning this purchase and do not recommend it. Spend the extra money on a device that works. You'll be glad you did."
1.0,This item does not work on Apple MacBook Pros. Do not buy if you are an Apple user.
1.0,Does not work on Windows 10 or 7. No product support from their website. Can't find drivers...very disappointed. Tried on 3 different computers with no luck. Never had these kind of issues with a plug and play mouse. On the plus side it does look and feel nice.
1.0,The product I purchased was too big for my computer. This is the second shell I got that was too big.
1.0,Like many others I report that this piece of crap didn't work (Mini White HDMI to AV RCA Converter).  The RCA video (yellow video output) wouldn't sync up as input to a known good display device (tried switching this converter to either NTSC or PAL).  A total waste of money as Amazon won't give a refund.  It's clear these folks are putting out a fair number of these that are junk with only a few folks reporting success.  You can form your own theory as to how bad you want to imagine the depths of Chinese junk manufacturing. The single sheet &#34;User Guide&#34; is a similar joke.  The promotional-speak in it and on the box says no power adapter is required when in fact this box must be powered (using the supplied USB cable) by the 5 VDC of a USB port.  Don't waste your money and I wish Amazon had some way to just terminate availability of such a waste of time/money of their customers.  I am now all the more suspicious of buying anything more from Amazon in general.
1.0,It couldn't work properly with windows 10
1.0,Slow PC. No good the screen & sound quality. Very difficult to use the touch pad and key board.  Disappointed!
1.0,"I bought a zenbook ux303LN notebook 4 months ago. The first laptop that I received could not be turned on at all. I returned the laptop for a new one. 4 months after I use the laptop, I suddenly noticed that the hinge is broken, and it makes a cracking sound. I had to send the laptop back to asus to be repaired for at least 3 weeks. I could not do anything now, since I have to use my laptop everyday. I am also afraid that after my warranty is gone (12 months), my laptop would be useless. I am really disappointed with ASUS"
1.0,Tried to use it once and threw it in the trash.
1.0,"Cable barely works, only charges my phone like half the time"
1.0,included adapter does not work with the memory card. Boo.
1.0,DON'T BUY! I bought this thinking it would be ideal for what I needed. Many fans with good ventilation. Started out great but it stopped working just after the 30 days. Now I can't return to exchange for another because it's after their 30 days return policy.VERY UPSETTING!
1.0,"Arris has the worst customer service ever!!!<br />The modem was stop working in 10 months, the modem still under warranty and Arris customer support  refuse to take it back to repair or replace."
1.0,Unable to unlock  Instructions very poor.  Would not recommend it to any one.
1.0,Outdated
1.0,I have had this barely two months and it's already died. Gets very hot like it's just barely able to supply power to the laptop. Would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,Bought this and when I installed it in my PS4 it was worse than the original one. Waste of money!
1.0,"I purchased this Wireless HDD with the intent to save iTunes purchased files to it instead of saving directly to my devices.  This device works well enough with non-DRM protected files, but if you want to play your saved iTunes purchases over the Seagate Media app, that's going to be next to impossible due to a non-compatabilty issue with iOS 8 or newer this is listed on the Seagate support page.  There probably is a work-around to this, but I didn't purchase this item to take on the challenge.  I recommend going to the Seagate website to take a look at the list of limitations of this drive and supporting software prior to buying it.  I'm going to return it and give one of Seagate's competitors a try."
1.0,The product wouldn't adhere to my Kindle at all.
1.0,It fell apart after a week poor quality. Have issues getting it returned
1.0,wrong fit
1.0,Haven't found it to extend the range of the WiFi signal.
1.0,"Junk did not work at all, and never will due to plastic parts that snapped off"
1.0,"I bought this because I like thin mouse pads with a non-cloth surface. Once I put it on my desk, it stuck right away and stayed put until I had to move it. After that it no longer stuck to the surface and it started to slowly warp more and more. Now it's warped to the point where my laster mouse no longer function properly. I basically can no longer use it and will have to look elsewhere for a mouse-pad. After this experience I would definitely not recommend this mouse-pad to anyone who is a serious gamer."
1.0,"Known bugs and issues with this product. Similar to other reviewers, it worked for a bit, then I began having boot issues."
1.0,It was on time but I requested red for my grand son and it came in pink
1.0,I am going this product for now a 1 star as the motherboard showed up without the clamps for the memory!  Not much else but to question MSI's quality control methods as this seems like it would be a glaring item of note.  I saw it as soon as I took it out of the bag.  Very displeased because now I have to return to Amazon and then wait for the refund to credit to my account before buying another board.  Nothing like sitting your son down to put together his first real PC and have this happen.<br /><br />UPDATE:  My only option was to return for a refund.  Now the price has jumped from $136 to $175!!!  So much for buying it again.
1.0,"When it arrived the shipping box showed no damage, but when I unpacked the charger the converter case was in two pieces. My coworker was there and his first words were &#34;Well, that's random&#34;. He saw right away what I saw. All the screw posts were snapped off inide. At first we thought about super glue some such fix, but I decided to just send it back. Sorry. Just can't justify trying again."
1.0,Reliability issue .... DO NOT buy!! Managed to use it only once before it burnt out. That's what you get for $12.99 I guess. A real big let down indeed.
1.0,Don't buy they don't back there products!<br />I bought 3 tablets a month later the on off switch broke on all three making them useless. I sent email and NEVER got a reply. Stay away from dragon products. I would not give a star but I have to to submit the review.
1.0,This did not fit my 13.3 inch Macbook Pro . It was too big! It was also scratched.
1.0,This charging cable is not good. It started sparking. I bought this for my Surface Pro 2... That's what it said it was for. It's going back!!!
1.0,"Avoid this product at all costs. Even it were free, you'll end up losing money on wasted time, effort and frustration.  After numerous resets, and setup attempts with the woefully feature-poor configuration, no device could ever actually establish a connection with this repeater.  The best you'll see is &#34;limited access&#34; and &#34;cannot connect&#34;, even after the device says it has been setup successfully and is transmitting an SSID.  At the end of the day, this device's only function is to occupy a power outlet and cause its small LED lights to glow.  It certainly is not capable of actually functioning as a repeater."
1.0,"Seemed to fit in my laptop OK, but it doesn't work right. I leave it plugged in all night with the computer turned off, turn it on in the morning, LEAVE the laptop plugged in, and it still dies after about an hour of use. Thought it might be my chord, so I switched that out as well but it made no difference. Would return to seller and see if the second one they sent me works if I knew how????"
1.0,"First day it was used, it was the first day of School for my 15 yr old son who takes very good care of his stuff. the main Zipper broke, it goes off track and opens the main Compartment and you can't close it. not happy at all had to rush out same day and buy a new. Of course 1 month return policy ran out."
1.0,"Item arrived with several keys on the keyboard not working, and the screen popped out of the casing. Returned for money back."
1.0,"The drive works just fine in another machine, but when I used this the external enclosure would not power on four months after I bought it. The power supply still shows 10 DCV but the board in the drive enclosure is dead."
1.0,It's probably backed by fake reviews. I don't know. It worked surprisingly well for the first month and now it's a reminder of what people can get away with selling on Amazon. Waste of money.
1.0,"I really wanted to LOVE this laptop.  I did all kinds of research and asked several IT people I know about the laptop they'd recommend.  They all said Lenovo is a great product (generally).  I really wanted a Z50 - not a G50, but Amazon didn't have one readily available.  My biggest dissatisfaction with the G50 is the battery life.  It is advertised as 5.5 hours.  I'm lucky to get 3.  I don't leave it charging all the time either...I generally charge it when it gets to an hour left...and then unplug it.  The mouse pad is hypersensitive and sometimes the mouse tabs don't work the first time so you have to keep trying.  It came installed with a bunch of bloat ware I had to remove, but I don't think that is unique to Lenovo.<br /><br />On the upside, the laptop does generally boot up and I can do what I need to do.  It is light enough for me to carry around pretty well - which is why I wanted  a new one.  All in all, I wish I'd stuck with an HP (my last 2 laptops have been HP's and I still use them!), but the G50 is serviceable.<br /><br />Update on this purchase 1 year and 2 weeks post order:  WORST PURCHASE EVER!  Over the last year I've had continual keyboard problems, I've had to reinstall the audio driver 4 times. Now, the battery is completely dead and the warranty expired 2 weeks ago.  Lenovo wouldn't budge on that, so I'll have to buy a new battery.  I've had HP laptops that lasted years. I still have my last one.  I guess I'll go back to that."
1.0,The charger on this tablet is very loose and almost impossible to use
1.0,The charger only keeps a charge if the computer is running while plugged in.
1.0,Dust stuck on the screen protector and created lots of bubbles on the screen.
1.0,"Horrible quality. Broke within a month of use, buttons are cheap, feel like they'll break."
1.0,"Very bad quality! It works only 1 month and then died....never worked....<br /><br />I bought a lot of flash drivers, even that cost 2-3 dollars, made in China, they have worked for years and never died. I really lost confidence to Corsair.....<br /><br />Currently, my computer and cell phone cannot read it or even detect it. I can not formulate it at all....<br /><br />Do not buy any flash driver from Corsair....Remember!"
1.0,"UPDATE: I received the replacement today, and my 5Ghz problem is resolved, but now I have a different problem - when I select channel 11, the router doesn't transmit!  This creates a problem, because in order to get away from other wifi signals, I need to use channel 11.<br /><br />I monitored the router output using WiFi Analyzer, and when channel 11 is set, the carrier disappears. Set channel 10 or any other channel, and the transmitted carrier reappears. I also verified by attempting to connect when set to 11. No go. It connects on all other channels.<br /><br />So, I'm giving up on this Netgear model. It's going back to Amazon tomorrow. Two different failure modes on two different examples is not a good sign.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I suddenly found myself in the market for a new router after my TP-Link router rolled over and died after about a year (no surprise). I settled on this Netgear R6400, primarily because it seemed to have the best reviews of it's competitors.<br /><br />It has built in setup software that works really well, and it automatically detected that I had an external router, and that I probably wanted to operate in Access Point mode (which I did).  Setup proceeded without any issues, which hasn't always been the case with older routers/access points.<br /><br />So, I was now up and running, and the 2.4Ghz coverage was great. However, 5Ghz coverage was basically nonexistent. I could successfully connect when I was within about 6  feet of the router - any further and I couldn't connect.<br /><br />I tried moving the router to three completely different locations - same result.  I tried repositioning the (permanently attached) antennas. No change. I tried different 5Ghz channels. Some improvement, but not enough to allow consistent connects.<br /><br />So, I'm returning it for replacement. I'm hoping that I just got a defective unit. Thanks to Amazon's fantastic Returns policy and procedures, I'll know in two days when the replacement gets here.<br /><br />If possible, I'll update this review with the results for the replacement."
1.0,"Don't waste your money and time with this product. After 3 months of careful use the right side started failing. This failure got worse and worse everyday. I submitted a warranty claim and it's been a month between &#34;we will process your claim&#34; and &#34;you will be redirected to the corresponding region&#34;. 3 weeks without any news regarding my claim. I don't even want to receive another one as now I know that it will also be defective, as defective as their customer service. I even tried calling and expent 30 minutes listening to the stupid onhold music in the end I just hanged the phone."
1.0,Does not improve signal at all
1.0,This review is for TabletExpress! They are selling defective junk. I ordered this Dragon touch for my 8 yo son with Autism and the first one we got never held a charge. This caused my son to have a 2 hour meltdown. I packaged it up and sent it back for a replacement. The replacement lasted 12 hours. It totally froze in the on position and once again completely blew out my son. And once again I have to return it to get my refund to buy from another seller.  The reviews on the Dragon Touch are great so I will order one but not from TabletExpress!! They are horrible!!
1.0,"Very Very Hot, not using don't need my house going up in flames!"
1.0,It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
1.0,"came with the damaged hard drive , I had to spend $ 130 fix.."
1.0,"I have 5 of these, one in white and the others in black.  The white one broke from the inside and was replaced with the life time warranty, as stated.  Then 2 out of the other 4, that I purchase in black went or broke from the inside.  Contacted person about replacing the other 2 that stopped working.  No response or replacement on cables.  They don't stand behind the life time warranty, as stated.  Will not be buying or doing business, with this outfit again, unless they fix the issue.  This is why they get 1 star."
1.0,Did not purchase this item
1.0,does not work with above board USB 3.0 ports. Error code from computer does not have enough power.<br />external power source should be required with this product. You should learn from outher peoples mistakes.
1.0,"It's cute and I loved that it oscillated, but either I got a defective one or these things are not meant to be used all day while you're at work."
1.0,didn't fit as advertised
1.0,Not up to mark.sound quality is really bad
1.0,"Out of the 5 cables, 2 of them still seem to work a week after we started using them."
1.0,"Every bad review was true but I hoped for the best. No matter how long you charge the battery, the charge will last 2-3 hours at best. I advise that no one should purchase this charger. There is 1 start because I could post the review without it. It is not worth 1 star."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.  I bought 4 of these units for archival backup.  They get used once a month at best.  Of the 4, I have had two lose all but 500GB of data.  Before Windows did the anniversary update, if the drive did not mount properly, you could just shutdown and re-boot.  Windows must automatically try to fix the drive now.  If the drive does not mount properly, most of your data will evaporate.  You will lose all but a small portion of data.  The drive will test fine, but only a handful of files will be there.  To add insult to injury, Seagate has data recovery software, but wants $99 with a limit of 24 uses in a year.  They create the issue and then have the paid solution to possibly fix it.  Nice business model!  I REPEAT this has happened twice to me with 2 different drives.  I thought the first time was a fluke, but now it happened on a second drive.  I have a Windows 10 machine with USB 3.1 ports and use USB 3.1 enclosures.  This has not happened to ANY of my other (9) drives which are 6TB and smaller of varying brands.  The other drives get much heavier use."
1.0,No one is thinking of buying the company (MSI)<br />There was a flaw in the motherboard manufacturers and no one can help me<br />Requested assistance from Amazon did not help me<br />Requested assistance from MSI just got them instruction booklet<br /><br />Think of Asus or Gigabyte best
1.0,I bought this mouse only 2 weeks ago and all of a sudden the mouse stopped working. I have switched out the USB many time and changed the batteries over and over. Would not suggest anyone buy this!

1.0,wireless settings are messed up. customer support sucks. dont buy specially if you are a comcast customer.
1.0,I am not a kid but I have used computers at work and at home for about 25 years.  I tried to add my National Geographic App but have been unsuccessful.  I would like to get rid of some of the apps already there but that is difficult.  Forget the camera.  I need to use a different camera.  I am really sorry that I bought this.  It was a toss up between a smart phone and this and I really with I had gotten a better smart phone instead.
1.0,Third Logitech mouse in a row that failed even after I ordered an expensive model.<br />No more Logitech for this consumer!!!  The expensive one barely made it to a month.
1.0,"Battery life is terrible. I bought four of these for my grandchildren and they each told me they get two hours of use (if that) and the battery needs to be charged. These tablets are fully charged when they close them up for the night and wake up to dead battery, which drains while not being used. They are ages 11 through 19 and are very tech savvy so we can't blame this on the recipients being too young to know what they're doing. They are also unhappy about the poor selection of apps available for these tablets. I would not buy again. I have four very disappointed grandchildren and consider this a bad investment on my part."
1.0,"I'm disappointed, the box said bubble free and it's not .I don't think I will buy from it again I'm very upset . look close to it You will see it"
1.0,Not good.
1.0,But the laptop for friend it said it was used my friend started up it did not work and then died USB port did not work it was not told in the description I contacted the seller he said I should read the description better I did it said that have a scratch on it and that it would start up and start off but it completely died I don't think that people should go roundshould be responsible for selling products that do not work I was still a bit ago and I paid $340 for the computer I should get my money back
1.0,Move on.  Look for something else.  Set up is a nightmare.  If you want to spend hours on the phone or chatline with customer service then buy this product.
1.0,"1. There is nothing as LQM®. It is the same &#34; SIKER®New Replacement battery for Dell Inspiron 14R (5421, 5437) ,Inspiron 15R (3521) ,Inspiron 17R (5521, 5537) ,Compatible P/N: MR90Y, N121Y, G35K4, MK1R0, YGMTN [6cell, 65WH]--18 months warranty.&#34; It is the same company, and they are just trying to sell through another name. Maybe because the bad reviews.<br />2. The Battery does not fit properly in its slot and falls down when laptop lifted up.<br />3. Bad packaging. Even the final bubble case was already opened.<br />4. Finally, sent back for a refund."
1.0,Flimzy.  Not worthy of the Anker name.  3 out of 6 are already broken at the m-USB side..  These are nowhere close to quality of OEM cables that come with your phones and tablets.
1.0,not powering on.. waste of time.
1.0,does not work
1.0,"I too received a counterfeit card. Once you get to about 1/2 capacity the card becomes unusable, it is trash. I buy from Amazon because I trust Amazon and try to buy only well recognized name brands. Sandisk has a serious problem it appears.<br /><br />Worse, when I contacted their (Sandisk) customer service they directed me to download SD card formatting programs from HP and some freeware stuff. Come on Sandisk, you make these SD cards and don't have a program that you can provide to your customers to fix problems or identify if the card isn't genuine?<br /><br />Also, shame on Amazon for allowing these counterfeit cards to get into their inventory. There is obviously a problem somewhere and I would easily suspect someone is swapping out counterfeit cards for genuine cards and making a lot of money doing it. In other words, an inside job?"
1.0,"DO NOT USE THIS IN AN iMAC!  I tried to use this product when replacing my iMac 2009 HDD, upgrading to SSD (simple swap, not the more advanced removal of the CD/DVD bay).  Product height is too large such that when put into an iMac, the LCD screen hits the top of the product, not letting the LCD sit flush.  If you force the LCD into the slots, you could crack the LCD.  Guessing the product works fine in a PC, but DO NOT use in an iMac."
1.0,"1. The reason for the SSD upgrade was when I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, I was running out of space on my Drive C. I had no problems with the Win10 upgrade.<br />2. I  bought the Samsung drive specifically because it came with software (Samsung Magician) to clone drive C from a running computer to an external Samsung drive. I successfully ran the software to copy from my internal C Drive to an external USB box with the 500G Samsung SSD. I waited until Magician said it was done (this was several minutes after it said the copy was 100% complete.)<br />3. The Problem:<br />4. I swapped the SSDs. When I restarted with the new Samsung SSD installed, I got the Windows 0xC000000E error. (Boot loader error). Message appears on a Recovery screen—Your PC needs to be repaired.

Error code: 0xc000000e<br />“You’ll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media.<br />Press Enter to try again<br />Press F8 for Startup Settings”<br />I don’t have a Windows 10 install disk.<br />5. I unswapped the SSDs. I got the same error. (0xC000000E).<br />6. On restart, I pressed F8 to start in safe mode. No help. Same error message (0xC000000E).<br />7. On restart, I pressed F12 and needed to tell the system which drive to start from. Starting from the old SSD, I was able to boot my system up. (I’m typing on it now.)<br />8. On restart without F12, I get the same error (0xC000000E).<br />9. On restart with F12 and the new SSD I get the Windows Boot Manager window. After ~two minutes this times out and then gives me 0xC000000E.<br />---<br />I will update this review as I work to resolve the problem--EVEN IF it means taking it to the GeekSquad."
1.0,The charge light is much brighter than it should be.  I quit using it because the charging system was giving conflicting messages.  I'm only hoping it didn't damage it.  My computer is in the closet until I can find an Original part on Ebay.
1.0,"By far the worst computer I have own.  Worked &#34;ok&#34; new out of the box, but make no mistake, this thing is slow.  After about 3 months it got even slower, for no reason.  No virus or other problems to cause it.  Installed windows 10 and thing got worse.  Sometime computer wont start up, you only get a blank screen, you can see the screen back light. Horrible to surf the web and a lot of bugs, Computer goes into standby mode when power cord is plugged in,the screen brightness sometimes is backward. Slide to dimmer and screen get brighter and the other way around.  Programs won't open when you click on them.  They maybe caused by Windows 10.  I have always bought Toshiba computers and this is my first Lenovo, and not happy with it.  Most likely won't be a repeat customer for them."
1.0,Very disappointed that I can't use it on the beach!  The glare makes it very difficult to see!
1.0,The suction cup wouldn't stick to anything if you added glue and duct tape. I'm sure on the perfect surface it would do it's job but since most automobiles don't have any surface that's 100% flat and always has a curvature to it you won't have any luck
1.0,Case don't work it press down button on the tablets for the SM-T700 not usable
1.0,Purchased this to record an epic rubicon trail trip. Within two hours I got an sd card failure. Had to break out a slower card to finish recording trip.  FAIL.
1.0,"It puts power out as expected so if all you want is the power then this is amazing. What I hate about this thing is ALL THE HEAT! I'm using a mini tower and 600Watts by no mean is a power hungry pc although I have a decently strong graphics card and require a decent power supply. Well in my tower the power box mounts to the top rear of the PC, When I touch the top of my pc it is extremely warm, My pc manages to stay cool due to my Zalman CPU cooler, although that heat... Not to mention the I/O switch on the back of this does not work... it initially did, although now it doesn't...<br /><br />Sure I could call them up and exchange it but what am I going to have in my computer? I'll just take their crap for the meantime until I want to spend money to replace it or it begins to cause problems"
1.0,"Cheap case, not a good quality leather/fabric. After keeping the case outside for 3 days, still bad smell does not goes away from the case."
1.0,Two out of three did not work. :( Love the length but very disappointed to only have 1 of them that works.
1.0,"Supposed to fit my tablet...It didn't, but I used it anyway"
1.0,I can't believe that cybertron puts up these pc's for around 900 dollars and they have the specs of 400 dollar gaming computers. HUGE RIP-OFF you can get a 2x better machine for over 100 dollars less. Would never recommend.
1.0,Horrible!!! Stopped working at 9 mos.. Do not buy
1.0,"After I got it synchronized with my iPad and started using it, my iPad froze, crashed and failed recovery. Any compatibility issues with iPad?"
1.0,"The clips which hold the battery are very flimsy and broke, so now the battery does not stay on."
1.0,Mount did not hold the Nabi 2 properly. It was very hard to adjust and secure the device tightly. I bought due to a week vacation trip we were taking and it broke after 2 days.
1.0,"FAIL.  Plugged it in, set up the switch, watched the blue light come on and flicker.  Wanted to use it as a network bridge and filesharing hub.  But... it doesn't work.  The advertised network came up briefly, then went away again.  Switched cables, switched outlets, switched everything.  There is no there there.  Just doesn't work :("
1.0,Stopped working in less than a week. Don't waste your money
1.0,"Installed it on a USB 3.0 port at the back of my PC, but it kept disconnecting my USB drives and corrupt file transfers. The speed is also not that fast, (but definitely more than USB 2.0)"
1.0,"This memory card is not Class 10 Speed. It is not 32 GB! It is 8 GB! It's fraud! It fools the computer into thinking it has 32 GB, but all files on last 24GB of all cards are always corrupt! The 8GB's that function somewhat are painfully slow and takes 10 times to 20 times as long to write to as it should, if not more time than a class 10 micro SD card should. If you think you can live with that you're wrong, because 3 out of the 3 cards I brought, opened and used started reporting errors one at 33 days and the other at 40 days and last today about day 65. I tried to use windows to repair them, but now they're all telling me drive corrupt reformat when I try to use them.. But they won't format. I tried the regular way and because that kept telling me I didn't have privileges to format drive when I tried, I tried with windows disk manager because that usually works when that is reported. It didn't. So you will lose all data you have stored on these cards either by having to reformat them or by not being able to access the data on them. Do yourself a favor and by a brand name like Kingson. I bought 5 of those and they operate as advertised. Also I looked online and can't find the warranty for these defective cards anywhere to get them replaced."
1.0,"I'm giving this only a 1 Star since it has not been installed yet.  The Insignia Table/PC that it has to be attached, is to be given to my youngest daughter, who will install it herself, when she comes to visit me in December.  I am far sighted, and if I'll install it before she picks it up, I might not do it, as good as it should be."
1.0,They charge my oneplus phone very very slow. At first I thought I had a defective cable so I returned it and got a replacement but its the same problem. I left it charging ask night and it did not charge all the way.  I can't even use the phone while it charges because it will die.
1.0,"I'm returning this piece of crap. Promises 150 mbps, delivers 10-12... Frustrating. Back it goes"
1.0,Did not work.
1.0,"Nothing wrong with it, just did not like exterior finish - looked too plastic"
1.0,Didn't fit
1.0,"Windows stopped loading out of the box... HP said it was a software issue, so we formatted and reinstalled Windows.  Same issue.  They had us ship it to them.  They said the fixed it... same issue after a few reboots... now still struggling with this weeks later."
1.0,"Our house got struck by lightning and killed our official Microsoft power supply. My husband didn't want to spend the money to get the official Microsoft power supply, so he bought this instead. It was a terrible choice. We used it one time. He was playing Madden 15 online with a friend and only played a quarter before the xbox shut off. Then he noticed a terrible smell, which ended up being the power supply. The xbox over heated and shut off so it didn't burn up. The power supply felt so unreal because it was so light, that should have been our first red flag. It was extremely hot to the touch after five minutes of use! Thankfully, our Xbox-one didn't get ruined and we didn't start a fire. We will stick to official Microsoft hardware."
1.0,This is cheap crap. Threw it away!
1.0,I'm am not tech savvy but I would not recommend this product to anyone who has to save videos bc it will not let me format it to FAT23? 32? Either way a waste for what I needed it to do
1.0,It is too thick to provide a clear screen
1.0,"The set looks great but once you unpack it, you realize how cheap it feels. And the sound is absolutely awful! The cable is way to short. I had to order an extension audio cable, but then the lights no longer worked. So we had to return this and get a more expensive speaker set. You get what you pay for!"
1.0,Made in China
1.0,pins was broken when i got this product was not impressed
1.0,I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents and should of went with gut instinct and sent back! They both are very finicky to get to charge! One of them charger port broke quickly like the 3rd day....no biggie used USB port to charge. Not a good idea 7 months later the thing is dead and won't charge! The screen also has a spot where it's not cracked but is white. I thought something was on it but you touch it and the area gets bigger! The second one now at 8 months always shows its charging but nothing's plugged into it and the battery level is going down! It freezes constantly and I've factory reset it and only have 2 apps installed on it! I've deleted those apps and it still freezes! I'm sure it's only a matter of time before it quits too! I didn't expect much for price I paid BUT it should last more than a year!
1.0,"great after i got somelse to set it up for me. the instruction were not clear enough for me.It didnot go like  1 2 3 4 5 6 ,You had to guess what they were trying to say or tell you.That's why I had to get some else who had work out the inst. when they had to go through the mess I had to go through. Great product,only the inst. are not as clear as it should be. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10,are clearer than 1 2 3 and you guess the rest of it,good luck u are on your own.The web site is not any good either. Jimmie Powell"
1.0,The item was advertised as fitting a mini DVI.  It does not fit in the Mini outlet for the MAC as advertised.  I have returned the item twice.  Once with a credit.  I had to purchase he item elsewhere.  Merchant may want to make it clear this item will not fit in the mini outlet of a MAC computer to avoid the need to return when it does not fit.
1.0,Came with a blown speaker replaced it and new one came with a blown speaker as well buy from razor instead
1.0,"Battery did not fit my computer,"
1.0,Product is great. The delivery was awful and not as advertised
1.0,"How is this for the ultimate slap-in-the-face?  I was with my daughter at the Taylor Swift 1989 tour concert in San Diego last night using my Galaxy Note 4 to take pictures and videos of the entire ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME experience and I even have my phone set to automatically back-up to my Dropbox account just in case something happens.  Despite all my precautions when I looked at my phone this morning there was this message about not supporting the SD card's file system with the prompt to format the card.  While I did not do anything to the card I did power down the phone, remove the card and placed it in the SD micro-adapter and tried to look at it in my computer and then again with a different USB reader and while I can read all other SD and MicroSD cards I can not see/read this card that HAD ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME NOT REPLACEABLE PICTURES!!!!!  Apparently at some point in the evening (probably when the SD card FAILED) the phone started saving pictures directly to the phones memory, but unfortunately the pictures are from the last performance of the evening.  I do like San Disk and I do think they make a nice product, but this could not have failed at a WORSE TIME!!!!!!"
1.0,We have two kindle fires. The 7 and the 6. They will not connect to my WiFi and if I finally get them to connect it only lasts for a few minutes. I have tried everything to fix but nothing works. I will never buy another kindle fire... Amazon doesn't offer any help to fix the problem.
1.0,It did not fit properly
1.0,Doesn't quite fit iPad Air 2 right.  Area for home button should be a little bigger. Can't get the iPad centered just right.
1.0,"One of the slowest laptops I have bought in years, the quad core AMD processor is slow as dirt."
1.0,Do not by to attach your USB 3.0 HDD drives or USB 3.0 Sticks!!! Device reconnects them every now and then which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to transfer lot of data and/or big files.
1.0,"The product never worked, the battery cover was so wimpy it broke putting it back on. Threw it in the trash!"
1.0,Books are erased from my Kindle!!!
1.0,"I ordered this case and it took about 2 or more months to arrive to my destination, even though the tracking and company told me it would take only 2 weeks to arrive to me. After arriving, it came in the wrong colour. Not only that, but the keyboard would not always connect or some of the keys would stop working for awhile. After a couple months a few of the keys fell off (mind you I take VERY good care of my iPad and cases). I was not at all happy with this purchase. BE CAREFUL"
1.0,This is a knock off from China and will not work on iPhones (Zero stars)
1.0,"The memory sticks seem to be defective, causing my computer to go dark and stop functioning. I reinstalled the original 2gb sticks that came with the computer, and the computer worked fine. I tried this twice, with the same result each time."
1.0,The top cover doesn't fit can't get it to stay on
1.0,"Windows 10 is NOT compatible with this Samsung 850 Pro 1TB Hard Drive. The Magician Software included and the Data Transfer software included are not recognized by the PC when you install the software programs. And the 1TB SSD itself is also not recognized by the PC! There isn't even a Letter that is assigned to the SSD when the connection is made with the recommended StarDust connection cable! The connection simply says &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; Even after manually assigning a Letter to the SSD, it is still identified as &#34;ASMT1051&#34; and doesn't work with the Data Transfer Software or the Magician Software. ... StarTech said in a comment that USB 3.0 powers only 900mA and is not compatible with all 2.5&#34; SSD units if they require more than 900mA of power. This Samsung unit says it uses 5 Volts and it also says 1.5A (1,500mA). The bottom line is that it truly is a disappointment that so many people are having this problem with the Samsung SSD units when working with Windows 10."
1.0,"doesnt work, should have been returned although I didnt want to go through the hassle"
1.0,"Didn't work with Windows 8.1, 10, or Vista. And I don't have the time or the inclination to find out why. Really astonishing that something as simple as a mouse could present so many problems."
1.0,Item does not work
1.0,"My Razer mouse didn't work, my PS4 controller also didn't work. My keyboard did work though.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, there seems to be a port for additional power but no adapter was provided - maybe that's the issue."
1.0,"Waste of time and money. Does not fit a 15&#34; XPS 15, although it is marketed as a case for a 15.1&#34; Dell XPS laptop. Avoid this product."
1.0,Why all these cheap cables dont last? After a couple of weeks they start disconecting and then not working at all.
1.0,"ok as a tablet, really bad as a phone ( full signal on other Androids - 1 bar on this one with the same SIM), battery below average, customer support is a joke really"
1.0,Bought this flash drive to transfer all my pics onto from an older laptop...plug it in... and my laptop didn't recognize it.. repeated several times and also rebooted my laptop... and still nothing.. also the product package inside the delivery envelope looked as if it had been opened... poss purchased..and then returned and resold... unfortunately that is what I will be doing also... returning..
1.0,it is bigger than the screen and therefore doesn't work
1.0,CHEAP PLASTIC
1.0,Feels really uncomfortable
1.0,Poor
1.0,"It did not charge after one week usage.  I's too busy to send back, 30 days return is expired.  I'm totally regret to purchase it base on all good reviews😞😞😞"
1.0,This item died 3 months after purchase...not happy at all
1.0,"No good keyboard....needs work...keys don't register...onscreen...and too many hours trying to figure out how to connect with PC, waste of money..."
1.0,"From day one, only three (3) of the four (4) sub slots worked.  Given the cost to return, I just use the two I ordered to get six of the promised eight slots.  Not worth the few bucks you may save versus the slightly more expensive models."
1.0,I have to echo what a lot of reviews have already said. This is the single worst tablet I have ever owned and I've owned many. It needs to be set on &#34;Fire&#34;! It is a continual battle with low storage and the wi-fi randomly turning off. My son has to come to me everyday or so because it's out of memory and the wi-fi isn't on. First and last Fire anything I will buy.
1.0,Purchased to replace a 4 year old router. Great reviews swayed me into this model. Signal was mediocre at best but it worked. After about a week the router stopped working. At first thought Internet was down as it literally went from working fine to no connection. Plugged in the old net gear this was to replace and decided to keep what we had. Very disappointed.
1.0,it broke so fast... it was very week i had to buy another one :(
1.0,Bought hoping to use all 10 ft of the cord. All 3 have stopped working because the Lightning plug part wore out from being bent around a lot. To fragile to be used. Better luck just buyin and extension cord with a 3' charging cable if you want use it far from an outlet
1.0,"Bought it in May.  By August, I had to replace it.  Rubber pads came off bottom, corners were chipping and cracking."
1.0,"I bought this for my Pebble Steel and it is a total waste of money, it does not charge at all and the magnet at the connector is not strong enough to hold to the watch."
1.0,doesn't worked well for my laptop. Too heavy.
1.0,"Complete disappointment. The first one that arrived was bad out of the box, would lose connectivity after a few hours. Tech support said to return it to Amazon and get another. Second one has the same issue, however it doesn't lose connectivity for 8-12 hrs, only have to reset it 2-3x per day. This one will be going back as well.<br />Range isnt as good as I thought it would be, about the same as the ancient Linksys I have."
1.0,"I thought I was getting a really good deal when I've bought 128GB version for $30 - WRONG. The only things that's good about this drive is it's size.<br />When writing any file over ~2GB it gets extremely hot (&#62;120F) and write speed drops to below 3MB/sec (not, it's not a typo!) using either USB2 or USB3 ports. Compare that real-life sequential write speed to &#34;up to 40MB/sec&#34; claimed by SanDisk.<br />Spend some more but don't buy this piece of electronic junk. If I can return it I certaily will."
1.0,"I received the adapter today and plugged it into my Windows 10, usb3.0 enabled, solid state hard drive, i7-4790 4.0 ghz cpu, 16GB memory gaming machine. The machine sits next to a Macbook pro I use for work. Both connect to my Verizon FIOS home router via wireless connections.<br /><br />I expected there would be some slight slowdown in network speed given the Macbook has a built-in network card and there is USB translation going on with the Satechi USB connector. However, using www.speedtest.net (Ookla) from both machines, the Macbook pulled 3.49 Mbps up and 5.48 down, whereas the Satechi pulled 2.43 Mbps down and 0.62 up. I repeated the test three times at different times of the day and got very similar results.<br /><br />If you want a wireless connection for browsing Yahoo, Satechi will do it for you, but don't expect anything else.. I bought it based on some reviews on Newegg and Amazon which said the Satechi was surprisingly fast, and I simply don't see anywhere near &#34;surprising&#34; unless its &#34;surprisingly slow&#34;. Weighing whether I want to try returning the Satechi or whether I'll just eat the $20 I spent on it."
1.0,"Despite being gentle with my laptop, this case started cracking within a week or two. At first it was just small pieces breaking, and after 2-3 weeks huge parts were breaking off to the point where the case no longer stayed on the laptop. Absolutely terrible product."
1.0,The cables feel great. But one failed to charge anything right out of the box. The other two failed over the next three weeks.
1.0,"This item was a replacement for another that came with a very short cord.  It has the long cord required, but does not have the power to charge my Galaxy S4 quickly like the original.  This one takes all night long to do a half-hour job.  Very unhappy with this."
1.0,Buttons are trashy.
1.0,Was wrong battery
1.0,"Junk! Do not buy! Bought 2, returning both."
1.0,keyboard didn't work.  Returned it.
1.0,We purchased this 5 months ago and have used it perhaps 6 times.  It no longer works!
1.0,The product was broken upon receipt. Actually it didn't even have the broken pieces in it so I think there is a fly in the manufacturing process. This prevented it from attaching to the air vents. I have own product like this before and I know how they are meant to work.
1.0,"Very disappointing.  First, the fit is very tight.  When plugged into my hp desktop, where the front panel has one usb port right over a second usb port, my wireless mouse adapter plugged into the other usb port freezes.  I can't use the mouse.  It seems the physical fit of the firewire adapter causes a short between the two usb ports.  So, I moved to the external 4 port hub usb adapter that is plugged into my hp laptop.  The usb ports are configured horizontally (not one over the other).  I then connected my Sony Handicam camcorder cable to the firewire adapter, and started a video download to a video editing program.  Nothing happened.  Nothing.  The laptop computer would not recognize the ECEC 1394 Firewire Adapter.  I do not recommend this product. I'd give it a zero star rating if I could.  Go for something better."
1.0,The one I received was defective.
1.0,No did not work
1.0,We got this tablet we for our 6 yr old son. He loves it. Picture and sound weren't great but completely fine for his age. Within 30 days we started having issues with the tablet holding a charge or randomly not turning on when we pushed the power button. Fast forward to two months after purchase and it just blacked out on my son mid game while being fully charged and hasn't turned back on.  The return policy is only 30 days so we're stuck with a broken tablet and a child who wants a replacement.  I know it's cheap but not worth the money still... very disappointed in this product.
1.0,"I just bought this item and I couldn't burn anything from beginning, they just give 1 month to claim a return but I was waiting to burn some projects I was working on. At the time I need it didn't recognize recordable disk as well movies."
1.0,Can't put any apps on it.
1.0,"Works with Nvidia Shield Tablet, but became loose after one use. Waste of money"
1.0,Loved it at first. Great sound. Three months later and it has a constant buzzing in the right ear speakers. Which is one month longer than the return policy.
1.0,"Your get what you pay for- true- but set aside the fact that it looks cheap, it actually freezes couple times when I was working on things that are very important. Just imagine the frustration when you need to get something done and your mouse when work--&#62; you can't use your computer. I've thrown this away."
1.0,"I love the styling, but this was completely worthless for a small drop with a 2-week old tablet. 4 year old dropped it from her waist height (about 20 inches) facedown onto a hard floor. The entire screen shattered. Now I'm looking at a $200+ repair bill."
1.0,Is not compatible with Asus Rampage Extreme IV.  They said it was did not work.
1.0,"Bad assemble, barely works."
1.0,"Imagine a high turtel race, yes. is that slow."
1.0,The operating system did not work when it arrived. I had to pay additional money to have it fixed.  Shortly after it stopped working.  What a waste of money.  Do not purchase.
1.0,These generic batteries are too often fusion heat bombs ready to set themselves on fire or stop working after in the fortieth hour.<br /><br />Generic 8 cell batteries are larger than Lenovo's since they're lined up as three rows ( 3 rows of two cylindrical Li-ION leaving the flat pad empty of the costlier lithium polymer.<br /><br />Writing a review of the 4 cell seems impossible since this was the only x60Tablet Four cell listed at this moment and you don't receive what you paid for.
1.0,Lasted maybe a month before it started to expand and push on my trackpad. Not impressed.
1.0,"DO NOT buy this monitor. There was crazy backlight bleeding 1 month into use but I decided to keep it. One year into use, I came to realize how bad the monitor really was. I had my ASUS ROG G75JW gaming laptop connected to the monitor through a HDMI cable when I heard a pop sound and both the monitor and laptop went out. I smelled smoke and checked all connections and found char marks on both connecting ends of the HDMI cable. The monitor was unresponsive and the laptop would not turn on either. I found char marks on the motherboard close to the HDMI port ASUS has REALLY bad quality control!"
1.0,Never receiver item!!!
1.0,Poor signal to to the router.
1.0,"I use the center wheel to not only scroll the page but by clicking on it you can open a new tab when browsing. With this mouse, there is a flaw that causes 2, 3 or 4 new tabs to be opened with each click of the wheel. Ive been using this feature on dozens of mouses for years and never had this problem. I should have returned it the very first day but thought it would &#34;break in&#34;. This flaw makes this mouse useless for me. Very aggravating and not even worth my time to return it.<br />The page forward and back button are good in theory but the location of the buttons causes the page to jump forward or back. I cant imagine how much worse this would be for someone with large hands. Be Warned!"
1.0,"This is so old. I waited about two months without bluetooth for this thing to arrive, and I ended up throwing it away! There is so much interference that I cannot use a bluetooth keyboard & mouse at the same time. Also cannot be repuposed to use as a wireless hub for gaming cintrollers because it is so old. Do not buy!"
1.0,Very disappointed. The color of the case isn't even close to the color in the advertised photo. The blue is much darker. The flowers aren't even pink; they are mauve. The main reason I bought the case is because I loved the colors in the photo.
1.0,"I just received this yesterday and as compared to the Paperwhite I bought in April 2015 it is terrible.  The screen is sephia colored and not crisp and clear.  When you compare the two Kindles side by side my old one is better even though it only has 221 dpi.  So much for the 300 dpi.  Also, it is supposed to be 4gb on device storage.  What a laugh.  I have no books on the device and I removed everything that was pre-loaded and it is barely 3Gb.  Amazon has some explaining to do about this so called new and improved Paperwhite."
1.0,Mouse button 4 broke in the first week of me having the mouse. 1/5 would not recommend
1.0,If you are an Apple user get away from this product.
1.0,"Loved the price  but not durable at all, back broke off in one week (normal use) didn't drop or used inappropriately.  Case fits good, and iPad is protected just missing back arm."
1.0,Stopped working after a couple days.
1.0,"Why I bought it: I enjoy how light weight it is. The price is a bargain. The platform allows it to run Microsoft.<br /><br />Why I can't use it: The memory is so small that it cannot run Microsoft 10, Microsoft Office, and a Web browser. As a result, I uninstalled Microsoft Office to make room for the newestimate upgrade, but now I cannot re-install it."
1.0,"If I could give this a zero star I would.  After only 35 days of owning this computer (and out of the 30 day refund window), this laptop is making a demonic screeching sound that will not go away unless I mute it. Horrible - horrible sound. After 5 months - it completely stopped working.  I would never buy another Lenovo again. I would never buy from this seller again."
1.0,Worked lovely at first but 3 months later it no longer charges my phone. Very unhappy with this purchase.
1.0,Too expensive.. $400 for $200 product?
1.0,No camera opening
1.0,Having a problem and they won't help me!<br />Very frustrated.  Probably an easy fix but they won't help.
1.0,I did NOT fit my color nook. It was trying to fit a speedo on a fat Italian guy at the beach.<br />It works well enough but the magnets do NOT line up good enough to snap it shut nicely.
1.0,"cheap plastic, bottom kept coming off..."
1.0,"The perfect review for this case was already written for a larger size cocoon grid it wrap case by Whoopsie, here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUUO4I0HBAZ4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FSZ70E&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=541966&store=pc<br /><br />I decided to take a few pictures of my case to show how it looks when having a few charging cables in the grid and two thin Razor Plus battery chargers.<br /><br />It looked like a great idea bur realistically there is not enough room to have something in the case and other items in the grid. It's a stretch (no pun intended) to close the wrap even when it's empty.  I don't have a lot of things in this case and it still ends up looking like an ill-fitted burrito.<br /><br />Then, there's the velcro design fail.  When you have the case unwrapped, flat open, the hook side is face down.  The hook side is the part that catches and scratches things.  Not so bad if you unwrap it on a hard surface.  But not so great if you open it on carpeting or a bedspread or...<br /><br />Cocoon needs to make the flap longer to accommodate items in both the case and the grid.  And they need to be more thoughtful about the velcro situation.  One suggestion would be to reverse the hook and loop placement and add another swatch of loop near the hook side, so that when you have the case open you can tack the hook side onto that."
1.0,"Terrible quality, it is unpolished. Item is not even black, but a shade of grey."
1.0,It gradually runs slower and slower and  now it's broken for no reason( when I sign in it just shows a black screen) I don't even know how to subdue my anger cuz I bought this in October 2014 and now it's only August 2015. I am sure I am not buying Dell again
1.0,"Very disappointed.  I have owned a Kindle for 5 years.  Over the last six months I loose my wi-fi but only for my Kindle.  The rest of my electronics work fine with my  wi-fi.  Your tech people don't understand how a mac computer works and keep telling me it's my modum.  A mac wi-fi comes directly from the computer.  My original Kindle  would no longer charge or open so I bought a paperwhite of which I can not get the wi-fi to work with my mac.  Once gain your tech people don't help.  My son-in-law was in town 3 months ago and he is not a tech person, but got my old Kindle connected with the mac wi-fi  in five minutes.  Too bad he is back in Ct.  Why for almost 5 years no problem with Kindle and mac and I am not the only one complaining about it because I see others on the web complaining."
1.0,Worked great the first few weeks but will no longer turn on.  Its 3 days before the cut off of not being able to return it any longer.
1.0,After two weeks it stopped working. I returned it. Waiting for refund
1.0,The iPad case keeps unsnapping! it does not hold together well at all! I wish I would have went with another brand!
1.0,The headphone broke on the first time use- it was a disaster product
1.0,"It seems to work for everything but the one thing I wanted it to do, record using a line into the mic jack. there was feedback."
1.0,lasted about 3 months.
1.0,DON'T BUY IT.  THE TABLET DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY TO WORK.  I HAD AT&T PUT IN A NEW ROUTER AND THIS DID NOT HELP AT ALL.  PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT.. YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR IT. GET A TABLE THAT HAS MORE MEMORY.
1.0,"I put on my galaxy avant, and always show notify  Damaged SD card. Hopefully I can get a replacement for this SD or any solution.<br />Please respond asap."
1.0,"Bought 6, three have already stopped working. I'd return them, but I'm sure it would become a huge hassle. Just take my word for it. Buy a different product."
1.0,I should have listened to the other reviews especially the ones that said about system crash or very slow. My wife started a online degree program and 1 day into using her new laptop it crashes blue screen and windows will not start great sending it back with only a few hours of use into it I'm glad she didn't save anything on this. I would recommend to buy a different laptop this one has problems.
1.0,"Received it today, plugged it in today in the manner required, am returning it tomorrow since none of the ports work.  No one's perfect, but what really frosts me is that evidently to save a few pennies on packaging the unit has a two-part AC plug unlike any I've ever seen.  The part at the end of the cord has prongs too short to fit into a standard AC outlet so they include the rest of it as a separate part which snaps onto the truncated part at the end of the cord, then it works since the unit lit up.<br /><br />Problem was trying to get it apart to stuff it back into the box.  May be possible, but in order to avoid possibly damaging it I just stuffed it back into the box which now looks like it's with child.<br /><br />Worse than that, thinking about long-term quality, can you really trust a company to give you quality when their cost controls are so tight that they're trying to save a few pennies by making the product box smaller, and which seems to have so little foresight that it doesn't anticipate (or perhaps care) about the return problem.<br /><br />My answer is &#34;no&#34; so I'm moving on to another  brand even though my previous portable hub from them was bought in 11-2011 and just died, which I suppose is good service."
1.0,Until it broke it was great then send it in to get repaired and now it's very very slow and there's voices in the background which I have no idea to get rid of
1.0,"Garbage out of the box.  There is a reason that it runs so inexpensive - the cable is delicately thin and easily susceptible to internal breakage, which is likely what happened to mine.  Brand new, plugged it in, nothing...  Played with it a while assuming that it must be something I was doing until I just got a black screen.  Started over and used a more robust (but sadly shorter) VGA cable that I already owned to troubleshoot the situation; my own cable worked perfectly.  Back to the garbage I foolishly bought, again and still nothing.  Now I'm tossing it and saving up for a more expensive, more sturdy cable.<br /><br />The lesson learned here?  Most of this quick and cheap solution type stuff is garbage - quickly degrading, non-functioning, crap.  There is no easy cheap fix, just exercises in frustration.  You get what you pay for, and most of it is all trash off the line.  The best use of this particular cord might be to hang the person who designed it, but that's about it."
1.0,Not what expected
1.0,"Received the wrong item. Was labeled for the tablet that I have,  but it wasn't right."
1.0,did not work at all.
1.0,Not pleased w purchase.
1.0,"Does not fit my kindle at all. Says it for the first generation kindle fire, which mine is, and the product has too much room around the edge! :("
1.0,This product does not work. Do not buy it.
1.0,"As many on the Microsoft forums have noted, the gift card no longer works, the website link is invalid. This only has 21GB on the SSD, not 32GB as advertised. Also something to note, even after removing all the bloatware, the PC gets extremely hot, there is no fan."
1.0,Be sure to fit this ASAP.  I waited and found it didn't fit. To late to return but fit not as advertised for ipad2
1.0,Received battery July 7 2015. By 8/23 it will not hold a charge.
1.0,I bought this mouse and the wireless one and both times within 3 months the mouse 5 button broke. I would like to see this item removed because the button is very useful but when it breaks the whole mouse feels awkward.
1.0,"Junk, lasted 2 months of very light use."
1.0,"This is frustrating. I bought this sky wifi smartpen and very dissapointed because it is not working. I live in Istanbul and if I send it back to USA for a replacement, sending it is also quite a lot cost and waste of money and waste of time. I heard that the company charges $49 for a replacement and,that means this pen will cost me almost $300 rather than $200 (also adding the shipment cost) even that it is not my fault. My pen was brand new and seeing it not working after unpacking my product is very very dissapointing. Never used and it seems like I purchased a defected device, which is not working at all. No lights, no sounds, nothing... I searched internet for a solution and found out that I'm not the only one. There are many many buyers complaining about the same problem. This pen is a total dissapointment."
1.0,"I was REALLY looking forward to using this box to transfer old video tapes to a digital format.  I really liked the idea that with this unit, the user had the opportunity to pick among three different file formats for recording, and that it could handle High Def.  After following the directions and setting it up, I was extremely disappointed in the fact that the video that was recorded stuttered, paused, froze, and every other which way but straight, uninterrupted video clips.  Mind you, I tried it with TWO different computers, both exceeding the minimum recommendations listed with the unit.  One computer was an i5 laptop with 6 GB of RAM; the other was a VERY robust machine with an i7 quad processor and 32 GB of RAM!  I REALLY wanted this unit to work, as there is nothing else out there that has what this unit boasts of having.  I returned it to Amazon, and purchased another product for about $100 less, which worked flawlessly at importing the video that I fed from my VCRs to the computer (the laptop, actually).  Perhaps the Hauppauge unit that I received was defective; I don't know....  I didn't exchange it to find out.  And evidently, it has worked well for others -- I am only reporting my personal experience here."
1.0,it was terrible! i was highly disappointed the chrager didnt even last a day before the wires snaped and didnt even work to charge anymore.I expected alot more from a simple chrger
1.0,"Piece of crap. Noticed it gave me way too many problems after it was too late to return it or do anything about it. Will sometimes play DVDs, will sometimes take forever to play them (while making really strange noises as it does so), and will sometimes straight up destroy the DVDs altogether. Do not buy."
1.0,"I bought this tablet despite the negative reviews about this product and for a while I felt like a winner. However, recently this so called &#34;company&#34; shamefully quit supporting this product's software. This might not mean much to the average user used for instance by Microsoft to quit supporting old Windows versions, However, in the case of the Playbook that you have to go through the Blackberry link to add data to the tablet's memory, this means that you cannot add songs via the USB port.<br />Blackberry company, please drop dead! You are much worst than even Microsoft!!!!"
1.0,So far it has not worked. Keeps giving error even after reinstalling.
1.0,Did not work at all.  Driver issues.  Software will not load.  Also attempted to load software from website.  That wouldn't work either.  Had to return to Amazon for a refund.
1.0,Did not work. Got a refund.
1.0,Cheap crap. Falls apart
1.0,Can't really rate yet Grandson took it to college without cord will rate let later
1.0,"The black ear coverings are not securely attached to the headphones, and came off as we opened the packaging. I spend over an hour trying to fold ends under and re-attach but was unable to do so."
1.0,They stopped charging after a week
1.0,"Great product until it dies after 3 months. Toshiba claims to have a 1 year warranty, but they don't answer their support 800 number, and that's the only way to get warranty service. So if it dies, like mine did, then you're totally screwed. These days you'd think they would offer support through live chat or email or something, or even an online form, but they don't. After calling at two different times and waiting on hold for a half hour and still not being able to talk to a person, all I can do is strongly recommend you choose a different brand. Their hold message doesn't even give you any hope that somebody will pick up, like &#34;thanks for your patience, there are 2 people in front of you&#34;. NOPE! they don't do that. Their complete lack of support is extremely discouraging, and really makes their warranty useless. You can't send it in for repair until you talk to a support person to get an RMA number."
1.0,"Not sure if it was the product or something else, but after using it once it blew out and is now a paper weight."
1.0,This thing works only half the time. If that. Junk.
1.0,"product did not work, would not charge phone, phone did not even recognize it as connected.  I purchased another product and it worked fine. (YCS Mini to micro )"
1.0,"the connectors do not secure the cable into the jack. push it in, pull it out without hearing any sort of click to let me know that it is secure. caused all sorts of connection issues. had to toss out numerous connectors..."
1.0,"I purchased this modem in January 2015 as the prices for Time Warner Cable's rental fess went through the roof.  I had nothing but problems with the modem... would unplug and plug back in almost daily.  In early August, it was being odd and not even turning on - I unplugged and plugged back in multiple times and it finally started working again.  A few days later, it completely died - the only thing that would turn on is the top green light.  I have since purchased a Netgear modem and it's been flawless - much faster and no lag for my TV, Fire Stick or iPhone."
1.0,Not for the long-term. Dead after 4 years and cannot recover data.
1.0,I purchased this junk 38 days ago on July 22 2015 and it stop working completely<br /> [[ASIN:B004JU260O VisionTek ATI Radeon HD 5570 1 GB SFF 4-Port VHDCI x16 PCI Express Graphics Card (900345)]]
1.0,"I am very disappointed. I spent good money and other than 5 or 6 stickers, all are pretty much useless and not likable at all. I really wish we could choose which stickers we can get and not get."
1.0,"Worked in light duty for about 6 months and then died.  It is a nice aluminum case, though!  I assume this is a fluke as I have had good luck with Sabrent, and I replaced it with a Sabrent EC-UK30 which has worked fine (so far)."
1.0,Good for the first few weeks but after a while the sound started to sound not to great.
1.0,"You have to download the drivers for it, it's kinda awkward to put on your pi, and feels extremely fragile as you don't want to touch the circuit board, I don't even know how it runs yet because it doesn't come with instructions on where or how to install the drivers."
1.0,My case want even stand up... n they process my order twice and would not returned it
1.0,"This monitor arrived to my house broken, when it was posted as hardly been used."
1.0,"This was a back to school gift for my sister. When we opened it in her dorm room we found that the USB nano receiver wasn't included with the mouse--either in the packaging or battery compartment storage slot. The instructions included with this mouse CLEARLY indicate that a USB nano receiver is included with the item. This mouse is useless without the nano receiver for the USB port. Based on other reviews from the past few weeks, this seems to be a consistent problem. The order is beyond the 30 day return policy so now we're out $$ and don't have a functioning mouse. Also, the battery that was included was dead. Skip this and get a different wireless mouse."
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,I won't return this as it works if I am careful but I don't recommend it.  Sometimes the keys will stick if they go down in a crooked way and it is what you get if you don't pay much.  It was cheap price and I got cheap.  Save for a better one.
1.0,"So not 7.1. There aren't enough ports for 7.1. Also, two mic inputs? This was a return."
1.0,"This thing might be OK, but unbelievably, it can not be set up to boot when power is applied.  Someone has to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time it's powered up.  This makes it useless for Kiosk work, which is a role that it would be perfect for otherwise.  I've never heard of a computer that didn't have a &#34;Boot when power applied&#34; option in the BIOS.  This is a bizarre and severe limitation."
1.0,"Tried to connect powered usb hub to computer, and it doesn't work with this cable. Tested with generic brand and it works fine"
1.0,Mine didn't work
1.0,"Did not work, computer would not reconize it."
1.0,prevent my computer from booting up.
1.0,This cord does not fit the HP envy sleekbook model specified and is not HP brand as indicated in the listing. Cheap knockoff made in China.
1.0,Product was not as pictured. False advertisement. Does not have the mouse insert. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
1.0,this is not a 13&#34; case as labeled. false advertisement.
1.0,Not all the keys worked
1.0,Bad quality. It had scratches and scuff marks on it. I do not recommend this.
1.0,"After this, I think I'm completely done with this brand. This is the 2nd HP laptop I have purchased (for school work, general Web surfing) where the screen just quits. 1st time I was in the middle of typing a report when I took a break for dinner. When I returned the screen was asleep (not unusual) but would not wake up (unusual). Pretty much the same thing happened again on this most recent purchase (Nov. 2013). This laptop has hardly been used and wasn't even opened until after Christmas.  It's been used maybe 1 week out of a month on average.  Possibly less. I spent more time on my cellphone because it was much faster responding.  I had/have verizon fios wifi and speeds were great on everything else connected.  Pretty ridiculous HP. The system lagged from the start and the touchscreen didn't seem very accurate so I mostly used the keyboard and mouse. I'll be staying away from HP laptops going forward  that is for sure!"
1.0,My wifi got worse.
1.0,Broke before I could use it
1.0,"This key board is very cheaply made, though it looks like the apple one it is not of course and you can tell by the product that it was very cheaply made. When I got it 2 keys fell off within the first week. I do not us this product any more."
1.0,I got this laptop mat today and I haven't even used it because my laptop is sliding everywhere! The rubber stops do nothing. Returning it ASAP.
1.0,Worst product I've ever bought!! They all 3 worked for about a week... And then couldn't get them returned.. Ugh
1.0,"I bought this product and the 1TB Samsung EVO 850 Pro. The PC only acknowledges &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; There wasn't even a Letter assigned to the SSD until I read how to manually do that. But the USB still acknowledges it as &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; I read a StarTech employee comment say USB 3.0 supplies only 1,500 mA in power and does not work with some 2.5&#34; SSD drives. The EVO 850 Pro requires 1.5A, which is 1,500mA. Perhaps this is why it doesn't work. Windows 10 is not compatible with the Samsung Magician software or the Samsung Data Recovery software to Clone your Hard Drive. So if you have Windows 10, stay FAR away from Samsung! It is simply unforgivable that Samsung would make a SSD that cannot be identified by Windows 10."
1.0,did not work properly
1.0,"I.was NOT satisfied with this product!  The second time I used it, the microphone didn't work and I couldn't listen to the FM radio on my phone."
1.0,"The magnet only worked for like a few weeks! It was a great case when I first got it, but now it's worthless :-("
1.0,"I bought the STX II 7.1 because I wanted a high-end product and the test results sounded promising. I installed the sister cards first on a system with Windows 10 (Z87X-UD3H - i7-4770K) after uninstalling the drivers for my old Creative Sound Blaster. I powered them as required (with a 4-pin Molex connection). I even dedicated separate PSU cable to the card. I downloaded the Beta software for Windows 10 (64 bit) from the Asus website since the CD in the package didn't provide support for Win 10. However, I got the message &#34;Can't find any device&#34;. I retried it several times  (also disabled the onboard audio) without success. I then tried it on a second system with Windows 8 (Gigabyte Z77X-D3H - latest Bios - and i5-3570k cpu @ 3.40GHz) to no avail. Always the same message although the device manager in both cases recognized the card. I finally tried it through the support of Asus in Israel where I am right now. But the only suggestion I got was that I should go see the vendor or wait for Microsoft updating the drivers. They added: &#34;you can contact Microsoft by phone.&#34; People who want to buy this card have to realize that although the test version of Windows 10 is out for more than 6 months, Asus offers only a Beta version where the driver is basically the same than the buggy version for Windows 8. It is hardly understandable that a company that produces good to excellent hardware provides such unbelievable dilettantish software and offers such a poor service. As long as they don't correct these flaws I wouldn't recommend to buy it."
1.0,Battery doesn't hold charge. Total piece of shat
1.0,Lasted about a whole month before they started to one by one breaking. Length is great but don't waste your money!
1.0,Did not work. Not recognized by Windows. Tried multiple machines. Must be a dud. I hate wasting my time. Tried the included software and other methods but if the device manager has no clue the device is plugged in and there is no driver file provided on the &#34;driver disk&#34; then that is the end of the road. The driver disk just contained a couple of applications. I will order another and see what happens. I'll update the review.
1.0,"I honestly LOVED these at first. But, two of the three will no longer work (or compatible) with my phone.  And I'm sure the third will cause an issue too here shortly. Waste."
1.0,"While using this device to house my external ssd, it keep disconnecting itself from my Mac without warning. This is not good for many reasons, all of my music is on here and when I do a gig I can't have this happen at a live event."
1.0,another joke it works when it wants to so it`s somewhere in the house a waste of more money
1.0,Doesn't work with my the xbox one.  I have to push it in all the way and hold it of it can connect. When I let go it disconnects.  Waist of money.
1.0,It's not working I bought two chargers & it's not charging either one of my laptops
1.0,Only certain I pads does it work. Not mine.
1.0,Stopped working in two weeks.
1.0,This computer battery life is terrible.  Even when new.  Lasts about 45 minutes.  It also gets extremely hot.  Something is wrong with the design and choice of microprocessor.  And when it is not the performance suffers considerably.  Don't know if they are still available but don't buy this computer.
1.0,"I was happy to have received this car shaped mouse but was disappointed that it didn't work on my desktop or laptop computer.  I immediately notified Amazon and they provided me information on returning this product.  Not sure whether I am going to get credit for this, it doesn't really matter whether I get my five bucks, I am just disappointed that I had to buy another brand but needed to accumulate other purchases in order for me to get free shipping with orders of $35 minimum, since I buy frequently I don't need to buy Prime membership, it would be a waste of money, I am in no hurry to get things sent to my house, after all, Patience is a virtue.  Disappointed because I wanted a car shaped mouse but opted to get the traditional mouse instead."
1.0,Would have given it zero stars if I could.  Did not work in my Dell Inspiron 15.
1.0,"First, this battery does not fit correctly in my laptop. Although it charges correctly, it has altered my internet connection. My previous battery which was also a replacement battery worked perfectly, but only when the charger was plugged into my laptop. I bought this battery to allow my laptop to become portable again but I CAN'T CONNECT TO WI-FI. When I try to connect to wi-fi my connection looks perfect but when I open up any browser, they state that they cannot connect to the internet. My father and my boyfriend whom are both extremely technologically savvy couldn't even get it to work! Very disappointed and will be returning."
1.0,"Too big. it doesn't fit as in the posted images. In reality, it looks different than the posted images. When I tried to return it, they didn't accept my claim to return back. I would give it &#34;ZERO STAR&#34; if I could. Don't pay it and look for someone can fit the WD My Passport Ultra 1TB Portable External USB 3.0 Hard Drive."
1.0,I lost all my files on this usb flash drive.  I totally wasted my money on this product.  Please do not purchase this junk.
1.0,It sucked and that's all you need to know to not get it.
1.0,If I could figure out how to use it....  No instructions with it.  I've never used it in all the time I've owned it  :/
1.0,"Run - don't walk - away from this festering turd of a product and company. I purchased 4 of these to use as small form factor HTPCs. I have had a 75% failure rate. The problem is with the firmware, which is complete and total rubbish. Worst UEFI implementation EVER. On two of them, no matter what settings I use - UEFI or Legacy, they will not boot from a flash drive, making OS installation impossible. I'm quite proficient at troubleshooting; I tried different flash drives, different OS images, different USB ports on the zbox, even used the internal reset button to clear CMOS. Two of these are just plain non-functional. On the third one, I played with it and played with it and finally got it to boot from the flash drive. Got the OS installed and all software configured, and ON THE DAY that I delivered it to my customer - it wouldn't boot up! Nor would it boot from any sort of rescue/tool thumb drive. To make matters worse, Zotac's RMA process is very difficult and their rep's aren't very responsive, leaving me hanging with 3 worthless NUCs and a 4th that I refuse to trust.<br />I wanted so badly to love this. It has everything I wanted - built in wi-fi, lots of USB ports, great little form factor and at $99, how could I go wrong?! How unfortunate that the firmware is so awful (which, when you encounter this problem, you can't even update even if they release a new version!) It will be a long, long time before I buy another Zotac product. If Zotac ever replaces these things, I'll be selling them without even opening them."
1.0,"When I removed the drive from the package it was obviously refurbished and handled roughly; it had dents, smudges, and mangled tape.<br />But I installed it anyway.<br />Big surprise... it did not work.<br />It labored to accept discs and spin them.<br />Ultimately, the wii gave me an error.<br />I returned this item."
1.0,Not is Good....Sorry
1.0,"Using this on a HP Pavilion laptop. It never did properly charge the battery - my computer often displayed a warning to connect to a higher powered adapter.  Now less than two years after purchase, it's dead."
1.0,Keys stopped working after a few weeks.  Can't reach anyone through a website or phone number.  Very disappointing.
1.0,"Well, I *was* excited about this HDD until it arrived today. I opened the box and there's no !@#$% SATA cables to connect it to my computer!"
1.0,"I'm not sure if the grip to the battery us supposed to be so loose, but I have to position against something to make sure it doesn't fall out. Also the green light has been constant and no sign of the red light that's supposed to be visible when charging. I'll give it a few hours before returning to comment and deciding if I'm going to return it and look for a different product."
1.0,Prices are marked up to $399 and $499 for a $199 product.<br /><br />Ripoff
1.0,Would not recommend. The magnet is so strong that if you fold the cover around the back to hold it comfortably it turns the iPad off.  Pretty poor design or manufacturing in my opinion.
1.0,The color is great. The top fits perfectly but the bottom part is pretty loose. The bottom part isn't a snug fit like the top and it bothers me a whole lot because I feel like it will just fall off on its own or something. OH and it hurts my arms when I'm typing for a long time because of they way the case is... I really wanted this to work for my macbook :(  edited: I don't just feel like it's going to fall off... It does -_- I have to keep popping it back into place.
1.0,"I don't kno what's the problem but it never worked.Had to order a charging stand,hope it's gone work."
1.0,"Absolute rip off.....The case was putting so much pressure around the outside edges of the iPad.....The iPad fell off my coffee table - literally, less than 24&#34; fall......iPad screen was totally cracked.<br /><br />I would have been better off with no case.....Had no recourse.  And, after investigating, found out this was a fairly common issue  ;-("
1.0,Fjxx
1.0,"The adapter didn't work at all.  It would heat up when plugged in, so juice was running through it, but the device manager didn't recognize it on either of the two computers I used."
1.0,Didn't last long already broken
1.0,These lasted about a week each
1.0,Device died within 3 weeks of ownership. Screen quality is almost as bad as a lower brand tablet. Tried all methods other users had posted and still nothing. This is a wide spread issue with this tablet in particular.
1.0,They dont work well with apple products
1.0,POS<br />I bought this and it won't let me log in to my router it says Your router was not successfully setup correctly. which is not true and makes me so angry I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN YOU ALL ARE TRASH
1.0,After only 3 uses..the inner spring that holds the phone in place no longer works. Totally defective and waste of $. Will contact seller for replacement.
1.0,Terrible fit. I have to force fit my tablet and it almost had a permanent bend in the middle section where the IR blaster is.
1.0,"My Sony PSP with CFW won't even recognize this card, and neither will my PC.  Junk."
1.0,"Does not work. Should be the same as an older model which I now have, but maybe damaged."
1.0,I did return.
1.0,I purchased this adapter hoping it will fit into the unit as indicated with the various model use. This was the second purchase and I don't have the opportunity again to return the merchandise. this have been a frustrating process. Did not work as the tip of the adapter was to fine and very loose for the Lenovo g575.
1.0,I bought this tablet just to have around the house if i ever need to use a computer so i really dont even use it but somehow its not even working i connected it to the charger one day and doesn't charge or even turns on and i have berly been having it for 5 months and used it maybe 6 times and now it doesn't even work.
1.0,This thing doesn't  work never buy it
1.0,"I would give a minus rating if it were possible. I used it in my cell phone, and it soon became unreadable by the phone or PC. I don't know the tech term, but it could be exactly as the other poster warned of, unfortunately for me this post wasn't here when I bought mine. Time to attempt a refund. I will go with a higher priced BRAND name this time. I don't need to tell you what I lost in just pictures alone!"
1.0,Does not stand up well on anything other than a rough surface.
1.0,"Bought 2 of these, they came in plain brown boxes with the products wrapped in pink bubble wrap.  I assumed the products were new because nowhere on the product description page does it shows that it was an OEM or brown box product.  However, after unwrapping everything, I noticed that there were scratches and minor dents on the sharp edges on the adapter.  Furthermore, the serial numbers on the adapter itself was crossed out with permanent marker, which is highly suspicious if the products were legit.  Definitely not a new product.  But in any case, the products are working fine so far.  Just a word of warning to others buying the product, it might be a good idea to double check and confirm that this is indeed a new product if that's what you are looking for.  If you don't really care, then it doesn't matter.  My biggest concern is just the serial numbers being blacked out.  If my product stopped working for some reason and I want to call netgear for the warranty procedure, I wouldn't have a serial number to give them for a replacement.  So, it may be the case that this is an &#34;all sales final, no warranty&#34; product.  Update ***Sept.25, 2015*** I started having problems with the current available drivers of these USB sticks.  Apparently, trying to use them to create wireless hot-spots with the PC using a windows 7 or later OS doesn't work.  So, I thought, okay no big deal, I will contact netgear immediately and see how they can troubleshoot and fix the problem.  As it turns out, they wanted me to give them a 13 digit serial number on the device, but I couldnt because it was black markered out.  They warned me that these products were not retail, and that there was no warranty for these &#34;refurbished&#34; items.  So basically, one of the sellers, &#34;Goldpass&#34;, had sent me 2 of these refurbished items instead of retail ones.  After trying to contact them about the issue, they spouted nonsense about why they sent me 2 refurbished ones instead or retailones as excuses.  The email was barely intelligible.  The person who wrote it barely knew any English, and this is coming from an ESL teacher of almost a decade!  Since its been a considerable amount of time since my purchase, and I have already went abroad for work, it is already too late for me to recoup my losses.  But, I am writing this as a warning to anyone who plans to purchase this:  please make sure it comes in a RETAIL box with all the documentation and serial numbers.  At this point, I have 2 non functional, non refundable, and no warranty supported items just laying around as junk.  I reported this incident to Amazon representatives to warn them about this seller and hopefully their investigation can help stop this shady business practice to protect future customers.  The Amazon customer rep handled my situation very professionally and promptly.  However, the seller &#34;Goldpass&#34; has not made any efforts to resolve the dispute at all, despite my continued efforts to contact them, shame on them."
1.0,"Please pleasssse please do not and I mean do not buy this, it is the worse purchase I ever buy on Amazon, the day I got it is the same day I throw out in the bin. It is useless."
1.0,Lots of disconnecting issues and file system errors right from the start.  Can't even return it because it's impossible to erase the data that did get copied.
1.0,Junk! Purchased for sons bd and it quit working within a month! My seller was poor at communicating and taking care of the issue. Do not recommend!
1.0,"It did not work at all. There is no other way to say it, it just does not work. I have no idea if it is just this one or if it is common. I can't tell you to buy or not to buy."
1.0,Length of cables is great however the charge is very slow. Also the iphone freezes once the cable is plugged into the phone for charging.  Very frustrating and disappointing.
1.0,this item does not read credit cards what doI do to return it I no longer have package. 1st time used it.
1.0,This product sucks the drivers on the cd won't even install. I just keep getting an error telling me path can not be found.
1.0,"very dissapointed,used it for 3 weeks and then it started to disconnect and reconnect to my mac pro,then stopped working!went oto BEST BUY<br />WHER I BOUGHT IT FROM.and they told me me to call apple ,and wanted to give tme the number to call!!!left them the mouse and went home.<br />not buying this again!"
1.0,Potentially a great tool. But on my MacBook Pro when I asisgn tasks to a programmable button they all zoom in rather than preform the function. So far tech support can not fix the bug.
1.0,"Worked for first month, but has not worked since and now drains the battery on my android phone and kindle fire."
1.0,"I said I'd change my review if I got it to work and I did. This software is garbage, The USB to SATA drive works but forget cloning any drive/OS with the software. Use some freeware to get it to work. I'd go ZERO STARS if I could with this crap.<br /><br />I will change my rating if I get it to work, but so far, what a kludge of system.<br /><br />Specs: Lenovo Thinkpad i3 Core, 8 GB of RAM, Windows 7 Pro<br /><br />Firstly, if your old drive has bad sectors (which is why many of us replace an old drive), this is going to be a NIGHTMARE for you to use. I have learned this because the &#34;read&#34; part of this software will always find the two bad clusters (8,192 bits each) and freeze on its second scan of the disk and refuse to clone the drive even though it resolves all but 2 bits of read errors out of the 16,384 it finds and refuses to close out the cloning. 5 times so far today. Yes, chkdsk, SMART and Diskcheck just ignore/resolve these bad sectors, but this program won't.<br /><br />Secondly, it will only work well and at a decent speed if you created a bootable version of the software on a CD/DVD-RW or thumbdrive and boot it from there through BIOS. They neglect to tell you that. Don't try to clone from Windows, it's just not going to happen.<br /><br />Thirdly, for Lenovo users like me who are stuck with the bloatware we cannot get rid of, don't try to clone C: to USB. Lenovo won't export its Firmware of the HD to a USB beyond System Recovery. To even get your OEM HD to attempt to clone from a Lenovo to the new HD, you have to swap the original drive out, place it in the SATA-to-USB and install the new HD (SSD/SSHD) in the laptop's HD slot, boot the software for this program from BIOS and wait 45 minutes to see if your bad sectors will be read or not. (They probably won't.) Lenovo will let their proprietary garbage come *in* to the computer, but not *out* of it.<br /><br />I'm glad this system works for some or even maybe most, but it refuses to work for me even though it said it would.<br /><br />Based on the reviews I have seen about this company from those of us who can't use the Apricorn Upgrade System, I doubt Customer Support will be anything beyond &#34;I don't know&#34; if I try to resolve this due to our &#34;compatible&#34; systems not being compatible.<br /><br />I took a risk with Apricorn, I made a mistake. I'll keep trying to get it to work since I spent every last dollar my poor wallet had to save my computer and life's work, but I don't expect to spend a dime more with this company.seen about this company from those of us who can't use the Apricorn Upgrade System, I doubt Customer Support will be anything beyond &#34;I don't know&#34; if I try to resolve this due to our &#34;compatible&#34; systems not being compatible.

1.0,Does not fit amazon kindle.  Had to return it.
1.0,"If you want buyers for this product, you must show the other end of the cord.  What does it look like?"
1.0,"New Review:  The hinge keeps breaking because the plastic around it is too weak.  The plastic is cracking, its dificult to open and forcing it open only causes further damage to the weak plastic.  See the pictures below and look closely at edges near hinge.  I'm returning the second case in less than a year.  This one lasted exactly 30 days with TLC and no drops.  It's a beautiful case, the keyboard works pretty well for typing, but it's not engineered well enough - the easy part should have been using plastic that was strong enough, but Zagg failed on this one. Its too expensive to be this flimsy. Thank God I got the insurance.<br /><br />Old review:  I really like this case, and get compliments on it a lot.  It works well, fits in my purse, and the battery lasts more than 2 months on a charge.  It took me a few days to get used to the compact keys, but I can type pretty fast on it.  The one issue, which is why I think it's getting low ratings from others, is that you generally have to tell the Bluetooth to reconnect daily.  It's quick and easy to do from your iPad settings.  Frankly, I have this issue with all my Bluetooth devices: keyboards, stereo speakers, speakerphone in the car -so it's not unique to this keyboard and unfair to blame Zagg.  Maybe it's an Apple issue, but I think this keyboard deserves a higher rating so I gave it 5 stars."
1.0,"This remote is not very good! It has a few problems with the layout like the position of the mouse buttons which are all the way at the top and makes it hard to use them accurately. The fly mouse is very unreliable, every time the curser goes over anything that could be clicked on to be chosen it stops responding and it's a pain to get it to move again. The ir feature is nice if you want to control your av system and tv but I bought this to control my kodi box and the control has failed horribly. It wasn't even able to turn the box on or off so I had to program my box on the tv button so I could power it on and off same thing with volume. The big thing that made this a 1 star for me is the air mouse and how it gets stuck also the awkwardness of the buttons. Maybe someone else can get used to this but it is hard to press that button and not move the mouse while doing it and then having to try again."
1.0,"Bought this to take notes on my iPad. Writes nicely but the 3rd time I used it the plastic tip fell off and the stylus was no longer functional. Therefore I returned the product. Also, it is very heavy for its size. I have since purchased a more basic stylus for note taking for 1/4 the price, and it writes just as well. And came with extra tips."
1.0,"if i could give this zero stars, i would. 2/3 just plain don't work at all straight out of the box, and one of them works only periodically. 100% crap. i can honestly say this was a waste of money."
1.0,This flash drive broke after one use. No computer recognizes it and it pops out of the usb drive. I would highly discourage anyone from getting this.
1.0,Works only occasionally.
1.0,I bought this bookbag for my husband to use for his college classes. He has some back problems so carrying his books can be hard on him . College books are not light and I needed a reliable bookbag that could handle the weight of a laptop and a few thick text books. I was disappointed in this bag the second I opened the box. The material the bag is made of is very thin. The stitching looks unreliable and I felt it would come lose easily. When I put the books in the bag the bag didnt seem like it was capable of holding them. There was no cushion or protection for the books. The straps are not well sewn on and also look as though they could come lose easily. Overall this seems like a cheaply made bag I could get from any walmart or target and I was completely unsatisfied with the purchase. A bookbag is something that needs to be well made and reliable and this one failed to meet those standards. I returned the bag for a refund immediately.
1.0,didn't work
1.0,"Don't buy this product is complete garbage I bought it in May and it has completely failed in less than 90-days. Poor engineering It doesn't stay on the base of the computer securely and has cracked from falling off so many times. Extremely disappointed, I buy brands for quality and this is a let down."
1.0,"Product does not fix my laptop as CWK description. Can not return or get my refund because I do not have tracking number, I sent it regular mail therefore I do not have tracking number."
1.0,It didnt work. It sucks

1.0,wrong tiem
1.0,"Ordered 3 Lenovo laptops as gifts. All developed video problems, with horizontal lines flickering across the screen and the display going black when the screen was repositioned..  Two were returned to Lenovo for repair, all costs paid for by Lenovo. The screen and video cable to the display were replaced. One took a little over two weeks to get back, the other was back in one week.  Third one Lenovo said they were out of repair parts and to return to seller.  Unless we had a horrible string of bad luck, these laptops have an endemic problem with the display. We're hoping the repaired ones will be good to go, but if they just replaced them with the same screen/cable, then the problem seems likely to recur.  Buy the Y50 with caution. I'm giving it 3-stars dependent on how well the repairs hold up, as otherwise the performance of the laptop is very good for the price.  EDIT:  Reduced to 1-star.  Had to return one of the computers to the Lenovo Repair Depot for the 2nd time, same issue with the screen.  We've had the computers for 6 months, and that's three repairs so far.  It's obvious that it is a design or quality control issue with the part that keeps failing.  On the current repair, the Lenovo Repair Depot has run out of spare parts (apparently ours hasn't been the only computers with this problem) and estimated 2 months before spare parts would be available.  The computer is our son's college computer, and we can't afford to have it out of service for two months.  We asked Lenovo to return it to us, which they did promptly, but they reimaged the hard drive before returning the computer, so all files on it were erased."
1.0,I can't charge the keyboard because the cord doesn't fit.
1.0,love it   im changing my review due to after I got it in September of 2015 me and the kids took it on vacation with us to use in the car. Well not even 3 day in to our trip the thing wont turn on. due to its been more then a month I try to contact the seller to get manufacturing info on the tablet still no response im really upset
1.0,"This was a complete waste of money.  I purchased this strictly for us to have a second tablet to use for looking things up while we're in our living room/kitchen area where there is no computer.  This is the Yugo of tablets.<br /><br />First, the screen on this tablet is weird-I don't know if it's because I used the screen protector that came in the package, but you have to hold it just right or the picture looks distorted-it has an odd effect that reminds me of those old baseball cards that you can turn at a different angle and it looks like the player is moving.<br /><br />The place where you plug in the charger is not made very well--when I went to plug it in the first couple of times I thought they gave me the wrong charger because it was so hard to connect the two.  The plastic around the plug was not evenly cut which seems to have been what caused the fitting difficulty.<br /><br />The battery life is probably the worst thing about it, though.  I have only had this thing for a couple of weeks and don't use it that often [because the screen] and the battery drains crazy fast.  For example, I charged it yesterday [because it went from 73% to 2% overnight while turned off] & I watched the battery life drain by 3% as I went to facebook and looked at the news on the visible screen--I didn't even scroll down.  I lost a percentage point clicking from the home screen to facebook, then another percentage point once I got there and a third when I clicked back to home.  And I don't have a lot of apps running in the background, either, I checked.  It's a bit nerve-wracking trying to browse the internet while simultaneously watching the life drain out of your device with literally every click.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I'd get another brand--although this seems inexpensive by itself [minus the case], it's actually pretty expensive for something that fails at what it's meant to do.  Even though I only wanted it to use for web browsing, it is sadly not up to that simple task.  I don't understand how this has good reviews from people who use it for gaming unless they have it plugged in the whole time because it seems like that would drain the battery way faster than internet browsing."
1.0,this tablet is the worst tablet i bought three of them and they not working i got cheated on it i guess the case fooled me. the tablets not coming on it was a waste of money
1.0,I sent this back as it was very important for the pen attachment to stick and it didn't out of the box. Was too expensive for something not to work properly.
1.0,"After purchasing this motherboard and having a few different BIOS issues (even after updating to the latest BIOS), I contacted support, who quickly tried finding any and every possible way to weasle out of saying it is their motherboards fault. I even had multiple different asrock rep's tell me contradictory information about what the issue was and why they would not fix it.  At one point they even told me it was AMD's fault, and they didn't support it... After this the support reps wouldn't even email me back, I haven't been able to get in touch with them since. I would recommend a friend never buy asrock products again, I won't."
1.0,"I was almost fooled. it took me 3 hours to write 97GB of vidoes to this card and everything looked fine until i started testing the videos.After deleting and re writing some videos i came to conclusion that only about 40 GB of the data was readable,the rest was unreadable files. i am not sure if this thing has even 64 GB capacity."

1.0,Too many scratches.

1.0,"I installed the drivers that came with this and it corrupted my Windows 10 install. Windows just wouldn't boot up anymore! I mean, yes ok you don't support Windows 10, but there were no warnings and you just make the user's computer unbootable!?  Good thing I'm somewhat of an advanced computer user so I was able to fix my windows by disabling the corrupt drivers using autoruns.exe.  Then I found out that you can get Windows 10 drivers for it at Fresco Logic's website. (Google 'Fresco Logic Thin2000 USB drivers' if you need it.) And so I got it working on Windows 10. However I was disappointed to see that at 1920x1080 resolution, the display kept flickering very hard. At lower resolutions it is at least usable though and could handle things like playing a video fine. However 1920x1080 resolution is what I bought it for.  I recommend that if you have the drivers that came with this installed, DO NOT upgrade to Windows 10 before updating the Fresco Logic Thin2000 drivers."

1.0,"Charged my phone quickly for about a month. Then my phone kept telling me to use the original charger for faster charging and the cable  charging slowed down to a crawl. It also started to loosen up and my phone would go back and forth between charging and not charging due to how loose it was. However, they're cheap so I guess I'll buy another one and see how long it lasts.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bought a second. After about 2 months, this charger no longer works. Won't charge my phone at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bought a third. Worked again for about 2 months. Will be purchasing a 4th just because they're so cheap."
1.0,Wrong size.
1.0,Right fit but stopped working within a month.

1.0,"This was horrible. It came torn. Just out of curiosity, I tried to put it on to see if it was worth getting a replacement - it wasn't. It would've been way too loose to use."
1.0,very hard to work with windows 8/8.1.  I think the computer itself is very nice but it is hard for me to tell because I can't run windows and there was no offer of a free download of windows 10  I would like to have this option and try windows 10
1.0,".What a POS company NetGear is. I've been a Amazon loyal for years and buy lots of stuff, but this vendor has put me over the edge. I really wish I went through Amazon and not NetGear for the return. 5 phone calls later trying to fix a issue, I get hit with, I need to pay for your defective product return, and I get a reman item. Holy Crap. That's like calling Chevy, Ford  for a warranty issue and they say, you pay to tow it in and we'll fix it. Totally unacceptable, and I'm extremely disappointed. I run a very large contracting company, and I would've been out of business years ago treating customers this way, I really hope that is made right, as I really don't wanna post about this on a 170K plus member that I'm a member of."
1.0,"I travel quite frequently and take my video library with me on a small USB hard drive.  I then use the HooToo to stream it to my Amazon FireTV stick.  The HooToo makes watching Amazon Prime content a snap in a hotel room and with KODI, I can watch any of my movies on my hard drive plus all sorts of news, movies, TV shows, and foreign language content off the internet as well.<br /><br />I was excited to see this become available recently, but this product appears to have been rushed to market to replace the poorly working HT-TM04.  I have several of the Hoo Too HT-TM01's and they work great and do the job as advertised.  I purchased the HT-TM04 mainly because it had a built in power supply.  It looked just like my Mac Book Pro power supply.  The problem is that I did not want to accept a wired internet connection and the WiFi bridge performance was pathetic at best.  I returned it after 1 day.  Just recently the HT-TM06 came out, so I figured they solved the issues with the HT-TM04, so I bought one.  Boy did they rush to get this out without thinking.<br /><br />Main design flaws<br />Placement of the Ethernet RJ45 and USB ports.  On the older version (HT-TM04), you could plug it in at your desk in a hotel (where this is most useful) and your wired Internet and USB connections were easily accessible.  Now with the HT-TM06, they have been moved 90 degrees where they face down instead of opposite the power outlet.  Most hotels have power outlets and wired internet at the desk (see photo) and they tend to be close to the desk.  In this fashion, it is very difficult (if at all possible) to plug in your wired Internet and USB hard drive without bending and perhaps damaging the HooToo router.  The end result is I need to use a cheap extension cord in order to power the HooToo.  This kind of defeats the purpose of buying one in the first place over the HT-TM01 as I need to plug in a power supply to keep it running.<br /><br />Other major design flaw.<br />The WiFi setup for the HT-TM06 now has asterisks in place of the password, but not a second field to confirm the password entry.<br />This is very dangerous as you do not have any way to verify what you typed in.  The HT-TM01 has the password in clear text.<br />When you change the password for the Admin on the HT-TM06, you still have to re-enter it to confirm, so at least you can double check what you typed before you save it.If you make an error in typing when you assign a WiFi password and then save it, you will not be able to connect to the TM06 again.  You will have to reset it and start all over again.  Poor design.<br /><br />Interface dies<br />The web interface is improved (be sure to clear your browser cache if you have an older HooToo), but after running for 24 hours it froze and could not be reached via a browser or any HooToo apps on WiFi enabled mobile devices.  It required a reboot.  If this persists, then its just another example of rushing a product not ready to market.<br /><br />One last disappointment.<br />The HT-TM04 came with a nice felt case with a velcro flap enclosure.  It was snug so even in the case the HooToo did not take up much space in your travel bag, but it was still protected from scratches and small items from gumming up the Ethernet and USB ports.  This new and &#34;improved&#34; HT-TM06 does not come with one.  What a disappointment when HooToo set the expectation by including it with a lesser model, but going on the cheap with the latest one.<br /><br />Good things<br />The good things are a built in power supply and the ability to host multiple USB hard drives, but it remains to be seen if it will be stable for this use.  I will update this after a couple weeks of continued use."

1.0,Appeared to be too large in that I could not get the entire length to adhere to the screen of my iPhone 6 plus.  About a third of one end of the screen looked to have one large air bubble.  I checked to insure that it was properly aligned at both ends which it was.  Using a credit card to slowly force out the large air bubble only accomplished the cracking of the glass in one corner.

1.0,"I bought these intending to upgrade my original MacPro (MP 1,1 2.66 gHz Quad) from 8 GBs of ram to 11 GB (removing two 512KB sticks in the process).  The last couple of ram sticks I bought were cheap things off an auction site, but they worked fine and these from Komputer Bay had good reviews.  I figure if it registers in the system it works, right?<br /><br />Well, the first time I tried to install them, after I powered the machine back up, the main fan (the one over the main processor) started spinning out of control and spitting up a dust storm from deep inside the machine (guess it's time to clean it).  But it kept spinning ever faster -- like it was going to explode.  So I powered it off before it fully booted, removed the new Ram and reinstalled the old.  But the machine wouldn't re-boot.  It took a while to figure out that powering off in the middle of boot up had caused a kernel panic, but ultimately I was able to boot from a different drive and then reboot from the original OS drive.<br /><br />So I let the machine run as before for several days and everything performed flawlessly.  Then, to confirm, I shut the machine down, let it cool quite a while so that there was no residual heat and put the new Ram sticks back in being extra careful that everything was properly seated.  I rebooted and immediately the fan was running like a 747 engine.  But I was prepared for it (and didn't want to cause another kernel panic) so I let the machine fully boot up.  The fan was still running out of control and seemed to be going ever faster.  I didn't wait to check system profiler for the ram, but powered down properly and switched them out.<br /><br />Has anyone had a similar experience or does anyone know why Ram might cause this?  I haven't sent them back yet and am open to suggestions.  I will update this if anything changes.<br /><br />PS I am running OSX 10.6.8."
1.0,it smokes
1.0,"The CD rum door don't open , I purchase this item back in April 2015 I just start using it now and found out the hard way that is defective and that my 30 day return policy with amazon is no longer valid."
1.0,"I purchased two of these hoping for speed. Instead, we received inconsistent performance and corrupted files. My husband and I both use Canon 5D Mark III cameras and compact flash media all the time as we are both professional photographers. This is the first time we've experienced corrupted files with SanDisk. We had trouble with both CF cards. My husband tossed his and I was hoping to get a refund. Unfortunately I waited too long to take action and a refund is not possible."
1.0,"Flimsy design, won't hold iPad stable."
1.0,The battery is not working anymore. Only 1 month later.
1.0,Falls out of the laptop. Stopped working after a few months.
1.0,"The product build quality is good and solid.<br />The USB works fine for USB2.0 flash drives, and works on Windows 7 (after installing drivers, since Windows couldn't recognize and install from windows update), and on Linux (kernel 3.16+ no special config required).<br />However it did not work when I plugged a MyPassport USB3.0. It keeps connecting and disconnecting the device every 2 (two) seconds, making it impossible to use. Thus behavior is the same both on Windows and Linux, so it is not a driver issue (I have tried to download and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer, but the error persisted). I have checked the connections and also the power cable on the pci-e board and all is connected properly.<br />I got very disappointed with this, since the main reason I bought this was to plug in my MyPassport."
1.0,"I gave this one star but it really is my fault because I thought this was for my iPad Air 1.  But all in all, it is a nice case."
1.0,They make you jump through too many hoops!
1.0,Not a good tablet. It takes forever to download apps and just doesn't run very well.
1.0,"You can do anything with the remote and even google remote on your phone. It is cheap chineses made, if you has been use chineses product made you known what I mean . Just me , it is very difficult use the signal from remote very interrupt. Don't buy it, try Product made by USA company like Amazon, Apple and Google cast"
1.0,"Terrible!  All 5 of the ones in the pack that I ordered are wired wrong.  One output is perfect, the second has ever pin shifted over by one.  The Orange/White does not carry through.  We were building a new television news set and I didn't have time to reorder so I had to fix them.  Nobody should have to go through this.  Buy something else.  Yes, I do know that some of these are not really splitters and are in fact a way to combine two CAT 5 cables into one cable to run a long length and they to split them back on on the other end.  This is NOT one of those, and wouldn't work for that purpose either."
1.0,Fails afteR 2 weeks like all other cheap lightning cables.
1.0,Didn't fix my roomba problem.  The quality of poer supply adapter was fine but still can't use myt Roomba!!!
1.0,I never really got it in operation
1.0,"Horrible router.  I've set up dozens of routers, and have never seen the problems that this guy has.  If you search, you will find others having widespread connectivity problems since 1-2 years ago. Why in the world should problems connecting to Belkin Data Servers effect a hardware router in my house?  This isn't new technology. My 5+ year old D-Link can perform the one on only real function that a router is supposed to do, while this Belkin router fails. Sadly, I only hope now that it will make a good access point and I will just go back to using the old antique D-Link for routing."
1.0,Cheap quality/plastic - and it didn't work!
1.0,Worst mouse I've ever used. It feels odd when moving it around on a mouse pad. It does not move smoothly. After just 2 weeks the left click button would not register until you click harder and sometimes would register 2 or more clicks from only clicking once. Dragging and dropping files became increasingly frustrating because of this. After 3 weeks the right click would register even when not clicking at all. Playing games was even more frustrating when losing only because a mouse failed to register a click at a critical moment. The low price is appealing but it would be much wiser to invest a little more for an effecient mouse and save yourself the frustration. And it wouldn't be cheap if you end up having to replace this mouse in just months.
1.0,"I am sooo unhappy,  when I received my product,  it didn't fit my Ipad. It said it fits,  but it didn't.  They bed to write it clearly so people know."
1.0,The wire began to fray on the inside in about 2 weeks making the noise cut in and out.
1.0,wrong part for my laptop hp xt178
1.0,Received without screws and without screwdriver. Can't use it.
1.0,it did not work the pin was to short.  I tried to send it back but the seller would not respond.  I reordered a motorola charger.
1.0,"This product does not work. Instructions say to connect it and install the free i-Flashdrive application from the app store. There are two i-Flashdrive apps. I contacted the manufacturer. This device is no longer made, no longer supported and the app has been removed from the App Store."
1.0,"The one I received has very sharp corners on the top of the pop out stand device that the hand strap goes through which would have cut my hand if I had gripped it hard.  Otherwise, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating.  I'll round them out with a small file."
1.0,"Cord started ripping apart at the connection within a few months, can't use it anymore"
1.0,these just don't work reliably for 4k and so many issues with screen flashing and low displayport messages.so I sent it back and exchanged it for another one it did the same thing. decided to check out is there was any certified cables and accell was on the list so I decided to order one and it worked the first time I plugged it in no flickering no nothing it just worked.
1.0,"I used this to switch between a Linux and a Windows box. After a few month the Video Card in the Windows box became intermittent, and ultimately failed, while simultaneously the on-board video in the Linux box failed too! This switch is going in the trash, along with a damaged video card. I would recommend that you do not use it!"
1.0,Doesn't work at all!!
1.0,Junk!!! The picture showed a cable but the ones I received were just the plugs..<br />Couldn't get them to work and one of the plugs came off into my phone.. This isn't an apple product. Lies!!
1.0,"Bought an exact model from Costco a week ago for my wife for her school work with high expectation. Since her grad school has not started, she only played with it after work to get herself familiar with Windows 10. This Saturday morning she noticed the laptop screen was flickering, and I confirmed it as I sat watching the screen for a while. The rate of screen flickering seems to increase as time goes by. I will have to return it and look for another laptop while my wife's school starts next week. I am very disapointed with Dell's quality. I am restoring the system now. All the hours of installing software apps are wasted."
1.0,"Defective product, would not power on. ARRIS support was no help, only told me to return product to Amazon. Looks like I missed out on a great price, as the current price is now $25 more than I paid."
1.0,"Total piece of junk.  Right out of the box, three different computers wouldn't recognize it."
1.0,Horrible piece of crap..waste of money!!
1.0,They broke within a month and a half and the mic set quality was sub-par. The only redeeming factor was sound quality however if that is the only thing you need then I'd recommend just getting another product.
1.0,Purchased as a present for nephew and it worked great for a few days then it started acting up.<br />They had to return for a refund.
1.0,wasn't unlocked as claimed
1.0,faulty did not work
1.0,Under Windows 8.1 it could only see the 2.4 band.  When I upgraded to Windows 10 it became a brick. If I figure out a fix I will update this.  UPDATE: Still no improved driver that I can find... still a W10 brick.
1.0,Returned. Does not allow the keyboard to mount properly
1.0,Didn't work with my phone nor my tablet.. rip off
1.0,"Big as day on my package said DO NOT BEND,  my package was damaged."
1.0,"I would not waste your money. I can't keep it connected.  I am sitting less than 2 feet from the tower where the receiver is plugged in and it shuts off constantly. Sometimes it won't even connect.  If Wacom wants to do something, they should just make the cable that connects the tablet to the PC longer.  Their wireless accessory kit sucks.  What's worse, is I've researched the internet for a fix, and I've had absolutely no luck.  I purchased this in May and wasn't able to get around to installing / playing with it until sometime in July and am therefore probably going to be stuck with it and just out the money.  UPDATE: I have had no luck updating drivers or getting this to connect and stay connected. This kit is junk.  Don't waste your money, not until Wacom actually gets it to work and stay working."
1.0,"I needed to replace my Kindle 1 charger.  The charger I got is not the right one even though this is the one I ordered.  It is &#34;female&#34; not &#34;male&#34; like the kindle charger was.  Also, this picture is deceiving.  I have the identical exact kindle than in the picture but the charger fits to the left of the kindle, not the right.  By this picture here the charger is being plugged into the volume button!  I'm not sure if I got the tip exchange charger by mistake, it seems that way, but the picture here doesn't make me feel any more confident about re-ordering it to see if I get the right one this time so I'll go for the universal cell phone charger that others recommended."
1.0,I bought this cooler and i could not get the x bracet to line up in the right holes it sucks do NOT buy it.<br /><br />Can i please have a refund or something?
1.0,"It worked well at first.  I purchased it so I didn't have to have a long cable between the USB plug in my car and the place where the phone is clearly supposed to sit.  However, this cable stopped working after only several months.  I can no longer play music or charge my phone.  There does not appear to be any damage, so the ends must not be fitted/soldered too well."
1.0,cheap. broke almost instantly.
1.0,"While this battery physically fits in my Asus Eee 1000H PC and looks like the original battery, it will not take or hold a change nor is it recognized by the laptop re. it's status. I purchased another (10 cell) battery on Amazon that does work, This one is being returned."
1.0,it shows up  mycomputer can't do anything with it???
1.0,Though it says Apple MFi certified - I see the warning comes up saying this is not a supported cable.
1.0,Did not work on my ps3 to my laptop screen monitor.  I have to get my refund back.
1.0,did not work
1.0,"at first it was great and simple. it was easy to connect and what not but sometimes it would lag a bit and stuff but after a couple of days, for some reason it just refuses to light up and connect with my computer. so its a bit fustrating, its not the best.."
1.0,"My mother bought this and it started having problems 8 months after she bought it, well it quit working 8 days after the 1 year mark and they REFUSE to replace it (told us she has to pay for a replacement).  They said that they don't even fix their products...Why would you sell a product that you cannot repair.  Mom is on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy another one.  I have 4 different Kindle products at this moment and now will be getting rid of ALL of them and going to the Ipads (at least they fix their products)"
1.0,case is all I expected EXCEPT that it will not stay standing up as shown in this picture. What is wrong????
1.0,Not user friendly at all.  Have brought earlier models which I liked.
1.0,Need special headphones with this on
1.0,"It did not work with my iPod shuffle. I don't know why, it was not worth my time to send it back and ask for a refund so I didn't."
1.0,junk!
1.0,Doesnt work on my Nexus 7. Returned
1.0,"I bought this Portable DVD Writer which is supposed to be compatible with Windows 8 in May 2015.  I can get it to work just fine with Windows 7 but for some reason, it won't work with Windows 8 to download music from CD's into iTunes.  If you advertise that it is supposed to be Windows 8 compatible it should work with Windows 8.  I even downloaded the latest hardware version from Samsung but still can't get it to work.  I recommend you look elsewhere for a DVD Writer/Reader based on my experience."
1.0,"So far very unhappy.  Followed instructions and expected much more.  Comes to a full charge within 1/2 hour and lasts only 30-45 minutes.  Considering sending it back.  Update on first review: Sent the battery back to Anchor Direct.  After reading my review, they emailed me , sent me a prepaid shipping label to return it and sent me a new battery.  The new battery wasn't much better than he first.  They emailed me asking if I was satisfied and I told them my feelings.  So they sent me another return shipping label and I spent another $20.00 for a high capacity version.    I am sure that they emailed me 15-20 times during this process.  The last few have been asking me to edit my review being as they took such good care of me, so I am doing so now.  Granted they have went above and beyond to try to keep me happy so that I would give them a good review and I guess I should appreciate it.  My new high capacity battery doesn't come close to meeting my expectations, but I am tired of getting emails and sending batteries back and forth, so I am going to keep what I have.    In a nutshell, I guess I can say that their CS dept is good, although it got old for me, but I would say to stay away from this particular product."
1.0,I asked for a refund ..because battery did not fix my laptop. Seller never contacted me.
1.0,"This product should not include the word &#34;charge&#34; in its description, as it does not function as such, not in a USB port on a laptop, nor a car battery port, nor a wall charger unit.  I'm particularly disappointed because I opted for expedited shipping, as I'm on the road with no charger and that's the one thing I needed this product to do."
1.0,I want it fixed
1.0,It doesn't work.
1.0,Was broken before it got here
1.0,"The memories came defective, bad buy"
1.0,froze my Mac and unable to remove it
1.0,Didn't fit very well
1.0,"I have had to replace this power adapter again. This is the third one in 4 years. The wire that connects from the transformer or power supply to the laptop is shedding its insulation. The plastic or rubberized plastic around the wiring is falling apart and the wire sheath is starting to unravel. I have had to have two power supplies now, one at home and one at work. Apple should better than to make a crap product to use for a power supply. I have had instances where the power supply/converter has gotten hot. Again this is a fault of Apple for making a crap product without putting in the proper engineering design or proper quality control on their products. Why Apple does not fix this issue is beyond me."
1.0,"Did not work, third piece of equip I have ordered from Amazon that did not work. My last Amazon purchase"
1.0,"Could not get it to work! Tried with multiple hard drives but obviously defective. Good design and well made but once plugged in, it would appear and then disappear. Frustrating!"
1.0,"One of the pieces was defective, prongs inside were bent rendering it useless. The other gave poor video coloration."
1.0,This tablet sucks! Comes out of package power button faulty.Instruction booklet vague.Touch screen not working after paying to fix switch! Overall the seller is unprofessional!
1.0,D.O.A
1.0,Lags and makes everything slow
1.0,These tablets are great except if one of defective twice they don't warranty or refund BE VERY CAREFUL BUYING Anyone that has had problems with tabletexpress please visit and like my page. Facebook.com/tabletexpressstinks  We can get enough people to file a lawsuit and get back all the  time and money we have spent dealing with a company that screws over loyal customers. I recommended 5 people to buy them 4 out of 5 were defective. NOT Counting they'd two out of three that have failed in my household alone.
1.0,"Weaker Passmark CPU scores, weaker Quadro Passmark scores than the older model Lenovo workstations... This is a piece of crap!"
1.0,tablet is not coming on they not good only the case is good its a reap off
1.0,"I bought this case because the price is decent and there are few universal bluetooth keyboard cases for tablets.<br /><br />First, the pros. The case itself looks nice. It's fairly thin but good enough to protect the tablet from light incidents. The keyboard itself is amazing and the touchpad works great.<br /><br />The cons.<br />The case is thin. Too thin in my opinion. There is no magnetic clasp, you have to thread the little piece through a very small opening that is quite tedious and doesn't work well when one is on the go.<br />The keyboard constantly falls out. The magnets are nowhere near strong enough and the keyboard goes flying when you try to close the case or just pick it up. Very sad. The case is missing a stylus holder. Not a deal breaker on the stylus holder, but it is a real downside. The little holders for the tablet are cheap and flimsy and started to fall apart on day one when I was inserting the tablet.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great idea. The keyboard and touchpad are exactly what I wanted. Sadly, everything else is not. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a case unless you can fashion an idea to keep the keyboard in place. I've already returned mine and bought a different case."
1.0,"Due to poor build quality this monitor is not worth more than $100.  due to the fact that there is a known flaw relating to loss of picture: the capacitors will burn out leaving you with no ‘picture’ even though the monitor is on.  It will be like the monitor is going into standby mode.  The design flaw is termed, 'Two seconds to black.'  -- You will incur an expensive repair bill, or just junk the monitor.  Needless to say, I will never purchase an LG product again.  If you feel you must own and LG Monitor: only purchase a refurbished model.  I bought this LG Monitor – M2762:  I was quite happy for a few years, [luckily I bought mine refurbished off of an auction site."
1.0,Completely stopped working after 3 days!
1.0,Not a good productos. Not a good customer support
1.0,"Awful software, constant issues out of the box"
1.0,Not useful
1.0,Not excepted by Medicom DOCSIS 3.0.  Easier to get a Mediacom modem and pay the monthly.
1.0,IT DOESNT FIT MY DELL LAPTOP 1645.. I WAS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT DID
1.0,"Worked good for a couple of months, but now says driver won't install."
1.0,Ordered two of these.  Both were DOA and had to be returned.  Ended up ordering a non-refurb that worked fine from another seller
1.0,don't buy.....waist of money!
1.0,Lasted less than two weeks before the springs for the pins in the connector started sticking and would not charge my surface.  But one of those things where you get what you paid for. Cheap is as cheap does.
1.0,Kept crashing computer would not install drivers on windows 7 computer
1.0,It has fallen apart in less than a month. I have to lean the cable a certain way in order for it to make a connection.
1.0,Lasted less that 2 month's in the not a beast hands. I don't know what's wrong with all of these new inventions that are going to re-invent the wheel but I'll bet 4X what I paid for the POS that I gave a free one to a teacher. I hope to GOD that her's has some better luck. Maybe a HUMAN will read this get the message and send me two. All I'll do is give them away.To Teacher's.......
1.0,Only one slot worked
1.0,Terrible item. It stopped working in less than a year. After A WEEK of haggling with customer support they FINALLY sent me a box and a return slip so I can send it in to them and then 2 weeks later I got my new one. Six months later the new one stopped working.<br />This product is NOT worth the hassle.  Stand clear of it!
1.0,"The laptop worked ok for about one week,  except for the touch pad, which was glitching. A message popped up that I needed to allow some updates so I did.  Then it tried to update and now it will not do anything. The screen states &#34;failure configuring windows features reverting changes do not turn off your computer&#34;. This has not changed all day, I have waited 6 hours. It's a bit frustrating because I have school assignments due in a couple days!"
1.0,"When attempting to play a blu-ray dvd, the drive ejects itself and re-connects itself to my computer continuously until I give up. Very very poor product."
1.0,Didn't fit
1.0,Piece of garbage!! The speakers are a joke you turn it up all the way and still can't hear music or a DVD. The built in mouse  needs to be pushed hard to work and does not make the curser move to where you want. I could go on and on ....all i am saying is invest your money elsewhere.
1.0,Product does not connect to wifi. Very angry about this!
1.0,This thing is not working properly- I will need to send it back and get another one.
1.0,Unable to install on my laptop
1.0,"I thought the holder would keep me from losing it but there is no way to attach it to my tablet and of course, I lost it."
1.0,"It seems to protect the keyboard, but didn't fit my Sony Vaio at all!"
1.0,Operational for approx one month sent back to Asus for repair haven't used it after the repairs
1.0,Awful. Keys are broke and holds no charge. Waste of time and money. So let down
1.0,Had the cover for a week and the front of the case broke when I tried to remove it.  It protects well but the buttons on the side are really hard to press.  Not sure if pelican will exchange it.
1.0,"Used it four times. Wasn't very useful, since it stopped working after the 4th use"
1.0,"Worthless product I read all the good reviews and thought to give it a try but these chargers don't work at all, really touchy and will randomly just stop charging your phone. WASTE OF MONEU"
1.0,Did not work!
1.0,These cables did not work at all for charging any of the IPad models we have that use the lightning connector. So I'm not sure why they would even sell them claiming that they did.
1.0,I paid 157.00 after the price with shipping and it is already giving me problems and I have not even had the item for a week...the Kindle will not stop freezing and the screen keeps going black... I am started to think I received a refurbished item because I should not be having these problems with the device this soon
1.0,Not 15.6.
1.0,"Hate to give a bad review but there is a clear design flaw.  Case will not close with the stylus in place.  Poor design, we returned ours."
1.0,"Disclaimer: First off, Amazon is honestly the best retailer known to man. I just want to clarify, my beef is not with Amazon at all, just Lenovo.<br /><br /> So, I purchased this computer. At first glance it was great! I installed all the stuff soon as I booted it up and was then prompted to install Windows 10. I used it for a couple days and it worked great! After a while, as soon as I signed in I would get an error message and the screen would turn blue and the computer would crash (The only sites I had visited at this time were youtube and facebook and I have anti virus software). I called Lenovo support for assistance, They informed me that my warranty expires in 3 months... I just purchased this laptop, brand new, and they said I have 3 months left on my 1 year warranty... Fine, whatever. The guy said it was a Windows 10 error  and that I needed to delete Windows 10 and use Windows 8. He said I could install Windows 10 later and install a patch. I wasn't interested considering what just happened and the fact I needed this for school. Finally my computer worked. Not 2 days later, I went on facebook and my friend posted a video on my timeline. I went to watch the video, boom, green screen. I could hear the video but the screen was green. I called Lenovo right away to utilize my (apparent 3 month warranty) The lady said it was an easy fix and she would have everything running in no time. She then proceeded to tell me that if I needed assistance I then needed to pay a service fee. I asked her &#34;Why would I pay a service fee for a brand new product I literally just purchased, that is not working?) She then proceeded to tell me that I could pay a one time service fee or sign up for a monthly subscription. Do not buy this laptop. If anything goes wrong with it, Lenovo customer service is worthless. If you like you can return it to Amazon within 30 days so long as its shipped by them and they can at least give you a full refund and they will even pay the shipping. But if you want a box that has nice computer parts but doesn't do anything and to have crappy customer service, purchase a Lenovo. The bad customer service may cost you an arm and a leg, but the headache comes for free! *Does two thumbs up and a sideways smile*"
1.0,Didnt work as expected
1.0,"Difficult to apply, perhaps because of cheep quality"
1.0,"Lasted about a month, and it said that it didn't exist. What a waste."

1.0,I ordered this on the 19th and was satisfied with the quick shipping only to be disappointed by the product itself. The product itself was too large to fit in the laptop to charge.
1.0,"I needed a new battery for my Acer Aspire One because the battery life had diminished to only about 3 hours since I have used it for a few years now. The LB1 High-Performance Battery seemed like a good replacement. The battery that came with my laptop is 2500mAh compared the new one that has 4400mAh and the size is about twice as large. I switched out the batteries and I was surprised to find that once it was fully charged it only had 4 hours of battery life! I tried recalibrating the battery several times and it is still the same. If you are expecting to get a 'High Performance' battery for your little laptop, don't waste your money on this product."
1.0,"Died after only two months light use in Samsung Galaxy S5:  Suddenly showed up as unformatted, after only ~17% of capacity used.  Not sure if bad luck, defective, or counterfeit."
1.0,Black Screen... see other reviews for details. Seems to be a common problem. I am very dissatisfied with this laptop.
1.0,"This is adorable, no doubt. I loved the keyboard, for the whole month that it worked. When I first received the set, I definitely would have given it four stars (deduction for the ridiculously loud keys and the slightly awkward mouse). So, if you're using this for set decoration, I say buy it. But if you need them to work, I'd do something else with your $30."
1.0,threw it away
1.0,This was a piece of crap. The edges of it wore off within a month and so my iPad has been sliding out of the case. I would not recommend it at all.
1.0,"Pros- Set up is easy. price is cheap. it does a good job if yours isnt broken. automatically sets up the button map, and it has like the xbox 360 controller drivers (?) or whatever so its recognized as a 360 controller for any recent laptop games. I loved it at first because it is actually about as good feeling as a legit 360 controller<br /><br />Cons-<br />left joystick- theres this small area between up and right, where it causes your character to slowly walk, instead of run. It caused this on dark souls, and a naruto game, ONLY in this small area, so its probably the controller. I ended up adapting my playing to move the camera more so I don't accidentally start walking in the middle of a fight... so the fact I adapted my game play around this controller means its faults are severe. THIS CONTROLLER IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE.<br /><br />left shoulder button - about 20 days after receiving it, the left shoulder button broke so I quit using it. Today I look and I'm past my 30 day warranty by 2 days, so I took it apart and looked at the little 1/32 of an inch square box button thing and something INSIDE of this little button is broke, because the button has no resistance to it... like something inside of it collapsed? so the button needs replaced, and of course the button has 4 soldered prongs, and you need to remove the trigger assembly which has 3 more soldered prongs to even get to it.... so I guess<br /><br />so its basically unusable now, unless I want to commit suicide on dark souls by being unable to block...."
1.0,This computer is regretfully slow and not what I expected.
1.0,NONE OF THEM WORKED...:(  HOW CAN I RETURN IT
1.0,"I purchased this because it had the adapter and the cable I need.  It works OK if you don't mind having a 1 foot long cable.  If I'd known the cable was so short, and for me unusable, I'd have purchased another product."
1.0,"I purchased this card as part of upgrading my computer to Windows 10. I am not a gamer, but I do use AutoCAD and other business applications. Regardless, I'm going to return this card because the drivers continually and repeatedly fail with a Kernel Mode Driver failure. Doing a web search for the problem results in web posts dating back for a couple of years. Many of the fixes recommend updating the driver. Other fixes suggest only installing the graphics driver and not the 3D nor Physix drivers. I've tried all that and still have the problem. As a final comment, the error appeared under Windows 7 before I upgraded to Windows 10. This problem has been around a long time for this adapter."
1.0,"I bought several of these for my kids to use with their Kindles, and the end that goes into the Kindle broke on everyone of them."
1.0,"These work okay...I think it really depends on the layout of your house. We tried using them for work, but it didn't seem to help our weak signal."
1.0,"It just stopped working, it didn't even break. It sucks"
1.0,"Bought it 11 months ago. Konked out. Will not charge. Runs really slow.<br /><br />2017 - Still worst purchase I ever made on amazon.  Runs slowly. Touchscreen never responded well.  I can read books on it, and that's it.  When I tap on a book it takes 3-5 minutes for the book to come up.  My next tablet will be an android tablet and I will just use Kindle Reader.  I cannot in good conscience recommend a Kindle of any generation to anyone else based on the fiasco this turned out to be."
1.0,"We had this professionally installed and it worked for a while but then it just stopped.  We looked at everything and everything was the same.  Total was of money for what it cost us and I cannot return it, missed the deadline but had it for a month before we could even schedule the installation.<br />Don't waste your money, we went back to cable and just mounted the smaller box under the tv unit."
1.0,"This is rubbish, don’t waste your money."
1.0,Received damaged LCD
1.0,Great fit
1.0,did not work with computer
1.0,"Not as pictured. What is pictured is a high quality OEM cable. What I received is a cheap, made in China junk wire cable which was DOA with one of the power conductors not in continuity (tested with Fluke meter).  No option for return of defective product -- really Amazon?  R U kidding?  Update:  contacted Amazon directly and they immediately issued a refund and just had me discard the bad cable.  I hope they don't have to take the hit for a crappy product but very happy with their customer service!  So....buy from Amazon, just don't buy this!"
1.0,"Broke after only a few months of intermittent use, initially it was great but the button started sticking and now the button to switch doesn't function at all."
1.0,"The drive seems to be OK, but the setup software, also used for registering, fails on any of three different browsers.  This is unacceptable, and a sure sign of problems to come.  Unit was returned for refund two days after it arrived."
1.0,The hard disk did not work
1.0,the think did not work it was a piece of garbage.  The charger when you plunged into the wall did not work at all.  Bad purchase<br /><br />Richard Vallone
1.0,"Does not work, ordered two and neither have produced sound in the 6 weeks I have been trying to get them to connect on my laptops. Amazon will now not accept a return since its past 30 days."
1.0,All three of these stopped working within a month don't buy!!!
1.0,"I really would love to know when they were testing this what cable and cramping tool they use, Because this always gives me bad connections."
1.0,"Just bought a new laptop, and hooked up trusty P2770H. Desktop is wider than the screen, and the monitor menus don't work with Windows 10. There doesn't seen to be any updated Samsung drivers for Windows 10. Dug deeper with chat help at Samsung, told that my model (bought at Costco) is a &#34;business model&#34; and I have to call their Tech Support MON-FRI to get help. Still working on this."
1.0,It didn't work.
1.0,They bubbled and they didn't  expose one of my features on my tablet! Had to take all three off my tablet and throw them away!
1.0,Garbage went bad less than 1 year I'm stuck
1.0,Died after 2 days. What else can you say.
1.0,next to my router it cant even play hd videos. has no gain and it gets me about .25 gb down and .01 up. my other 14 inch antennas het me perfect 30 up 30 down
1.0,"The plastic that holds the iPad in place started to break after four weeks.  Surprising, because the case never got damaged, or dropped.  I would suggest people to buy something else"
1.0,"This unit reads DVD only. Will not recognize blu ray discs at all. I have tried this with Win7, 8, 10 and Linux. It just does not work."
1.0,"Piece of $*it!<br />If I could have given this thing 0 stars I would have.<br />I have owned a number of Western Digital internal & external drives and have never had the kind of problems that this thing has.<br />As I approached my WD external drives capacity limit I started looking at something in the 5TB range and came across this Seagate drive.<br />I had been forewarned by an Air Force aviation mechanic friend of mine to stay clear of Seagate because of the numerous problem he has had with their reliability and he was NOT lying.<br />Outside of work, my family and I use hard drives for movies and T.V shows at home, so after transferring all our media files to this thing we went about enjoying our shows in the usual way.<br />A mere 3 weeks later this thing has failed.<br />The drive will not initialize and the power indicator light goes out and you can hear the drive spin down.<br />I am now forever sold on the fact that Seagate is absolute crap. Hell, it took 3 years before my first WD drive failed. This piece of roadkill took only 3 weeks to give up the ghost.<br />In my line of work, many of our clients and contractors use external drives for temp. data archiving and operational planning. Word of mouth is a powerful thing and I will do everything I can to make sure Seagate is known for what it truly represents...Crap.<br />I will never, ever, ever waste my money on a product bearing this name again and hopefully this review will save you from wasting yours."
1.0,Plays music but will not play movie on Windows 8.1 laptop.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,"If you're going to use sub-millimeter edge tolerances then you should include a more realistic number of screen protectors than two.  Twelve might do it.<br /><br />Unless you're planning to have a professional install this, do not waste your time or money."
1.0,"Does not fit kindle fire hd 7 as stated. Very disappointed as its so pretty, if they sold one that actually fit the kindle fire hd 7 I would be so happy. But unfortunately  I am disappointed"
1.0,"I never review, don't know where to start.  Well ya I do, first thing I noticed was a horrendous viewing angle. Then, upon trying it out found that it was the slowest Tablet I've ever had. Really, the specs to speak to this. Google Play doesn't seem to like the tablet it froze and I had to reset twice. 32g were? I downloaded two 12-30mb apps and I couldn't download load anything after. Pissed at this company and amazon for wasting my time, this was a Prime Item....wtf"
1.0,"I've had this for a while now. And I'm experiencing severe buyers remorse. Netflix always has problems. It rejected several updates. Can't look for updates, says server is unavailable. Cant seem to stream PLEX well at all. Even over ethernet streaming is bad...."
1.0,Did not work straight out of the box!!!!
1.0,"Gave this item as a gift this week, just past the 30-day return window. When my son opened the package the tablet was DOA. It would not charge. Would not power on. We tried other micro USB chargers, to no avail. I believe DEAL CHASER should either replace this item or refund my money."
1.0,"Just plane crap.  I just received it and it turns itself off anytime I run, well ANYTHING.  I have heard for years that Acer is the worst computer out there, but I figured I'd try it myself, and yes they are.  The fact you can't run chrome to check e-mail while downloading dropbox is just plain stupid.  DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP YOU WILL REGRET IT."
1.0,I bought 10 via a fundraiser for my classroom. 1 wss still in factory testing mode and useless. 1 emitted a buzzing noise when the power button was pressed and failed to boot. Another failed to come with the os. This really sucks.
1.0,"Bought this for my wife's Moto X 2nd gen, initially we noticed the micro USB end was a little loose in both our phones but it charged well. It worked great for several months then it started having connection issues. Soon after the issues started it stopped working all together, we tried it on all our devices and other transformers and it wouldn't charge anything. I purchased this high priced cable to never have to replace it. But it seems that they still have some issues to work out with them..."
1.0,"Kindle arrived, but software is not working properly. I can't open the start menu once I have opened a book, so it's impossible to return to Home screen (I have to open the dictionary abd from there go to Home). I tried reading the manual, but it wasn't very helpful because it referred to butttons that the device doesn't have. I imagine this device has the wrong software. I will contact Amazon to see if they can fix this."
1.0,"I made a point of avoiding similar but cheaper products because I wanted to make sure I got one that worked.  Well, this one does NOT work!  The first time I plugged it in to my iPad 2, my device showed a message that said this adapter is not compatible.  When I tried to disconnect it, the casing pulled off of the adapter, exposing the wires inside.  I slid it back together, tried plugging it in again then tried plugging it in to my iPhone 4 instead, and could not get a single response more from it.  Fortunately, I haven't had too many busts on Amazon before, but this product is absolute junk, and I was surprised when I came back here and was reminded how much I had paid."
1.0,"Stopped working after a couple weeks.  Spent hours on the phone and with support trying to get them to work consistently to no avail and now my Amazon return policy is up so I am stuck with 2 sets of these.  Waste of money, very disappointed."
1.0,"I purchased Nexus 9 right when it came out and received this cover a bit later. It protects the screen well when covered, and stays in place when it's covering the back. It also looks good. That's it for the good.<br /><br />When folded to prop the Nexus 9 up, the &#34;connection&#34; can be broken too easily with a slight bump. The magnet on either the cover or the Nexus 9 isn't strong enough. I have an iPad 2 to compare it to, and the iPad 2 never had this issue. Without the ability to confidently keep it propped up, it kind of does half of what I needed it for. I had to purchase an Amazon Basics tablet stand instead.<br /><br />Also, while covering the screen, the bottom corner doesn't stay down. It flaps ever so slightly, leaving a slight gap (pictured)."
1.0,"Please don't be naive like me and believe these bogus reviews. The Same day I received this is the same day it said &#34;not charging&#34; when I tried to use it. I knew better but I'm a college student on a budget and thought I'd give it a try. But this does not work, please save your money and time. The real chargers sold by Apple are expensive but at least they work, spend the extra money. So frustrated and I hate sending things back but there's no use in keeping it if it doesn't work !"
1.0,This review is for ZB-Knot Black case. This case was purchased just a little over a month ago and I am really regretting this purchase. The case is falling apart from even occasional use. I've had numerous cases for my various devices from different vendors and this one is the poorest quality. Definitely would not recommend it!
1.0,Arrived in a timely manner and worked perfectly.
1.0,"Junk !! Don't waste your money, defective battery's, only good for 3 days, I purchased 2 of them for two different notebooks, went bad at the same time, the seller doses not care, will not reach out and offer a refund. I wish I would have read the other reviews first..."
1.0,Received today - immediately returning. Touch screen is awful. Works only sometimes. Very frustrating to not even be able to enter my wi-fi password because the keyboard wouldn't recognize my touch. My advice - DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Update: Many games crash with the card... support and driver fixes are not happening. Heros of the storm works perfectly but overwatch crashes constantly... same with gta.  1 star until they fix it...........  I got this thinking, &#34;why should i pay 100 more for the 390x when all it has is a bit more clock speed.  I am very happy with it. I first played witcher 3 on a 27 inch 1440 monitor with freesync. All settings on ultra and hair works on, I was able to get 20-45 fps. When it dipped to about 20 it looked the worst, because it was also out of the freesync range. That being said it is very playing and I enjoyed a couple hours of gameplay before my schedule became overwhelming again. I also tested heros of the storm and it got 144 fps no problem.  This card is just excellent, in the future I may get another and run them in crossfire config.  If you get this, try to get a freesync monitor and 1440. good response time and ips would also be great. did i mention 75+ refresh rate?  Excellent Value!!!!!!"
1.0,You cannot swap out the hard drive without sending it back to HP. It took customer support and hour of lies to avoid telling me this.
1.0,Broke in a week....
1.0,Won't load windows cant return it or use it! Waste of time and money! I'm done!
1.0,Non-wet application of the screen protector - just doesn't work.  The screen protector just didn't stick to the curved edges of the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Can't recommend this product.
1.0,This does not work! I placed it in my phone and it would not show up at all. My phone reads any other card I put in except for this one. Would have returned it except I ripped the packaging and threw it out never thinking it wasn't going to work.
1.0,"You get what you pay for, this battery is good for an hour, tops!  Spend more and get a REAL battery."
1.0,Has anyone had trouble with the volume on this product? Amazon... you disappoint me once again!
1.0,"[IMO]<br />Although I don't own a G933, but I own a G930.<br />After reading all product description, I think this is a rip off for a gaming headset with this price tack.<br />Reason as follow:<br />1. As always, you cannot get a real 7.1 headset from Logitech because of the cost I think, so the claiming of 7.1 surround sound must come along with the famous buggy Logitech control software. So the * come behind 7.1 surround sound actually saying,&#34;YOU CAN ONLY GET 7.1-LIKE SURROUND SOUND WHEN YOU USING PC AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSOLE &#34;<br />2. Carrying the same idea from the last point, the claim of Multi-Platform Compatibility actually is silly, G933 can support it just because a 3.5 mm audio jet was added as one of the inputs. once you plug the audio on this G933, here is what you got: A WIRED, STEREO headset with LED lighting on it, it do sound like a $20 headset to me. ...<br />What?! it is a $200 gaming headset?! Come on!<br />3. Customizable lighting? What the...?! I CANNOT EVEN see the lighting on the headset while I am wearing it! COME ON genius!<br />4. G930 is a much reasonable choice I think, if you know how to fix the auto-turn off issue by a hack on the Logitech gaming software<br />[/IMO]"
1.0,The drivers aren't available for windows 8.
1.0,just when i got this laptop the Wifi kept turning off. I called tech support 4 times and each time I get someone who doesn't understand English. I got tired of trying to solve this issue with them and decided to return it. I wish companies in the US would hire people who have better command of the English language. This could be a small fix but i have to suffer because these companies don't want to pay higher salaries for American workers who would really help their customers.
1.0,"Unless you need something for target practice, don't waste your money.  The best one out there is the Adapter CADDY TRAY CAGE which I purchased and love, a bit more money, but well worth it."
1.0,"Arrived with bad block.  It comes with software on the drive, but the driver install software won't run because of the bad block."
1.0,"Not at all what I expected. I would think that if it says it's good to keep dust out of your usb slots of your computer, it would actually be for that but it's not. These are basically used as a cover for your USB pin drive (that are not retractable), the ends of your devices that plug into usb slot, etc. The description is misleading."
1.0,Card is either defective or not as advertised. Tested card capacity and only 7.7 gig of usable space.
1.0,"It lasted me about 3 months, now it's a paperweight. It's not worth the small amount of money, spend a few more dollars and buy a decent battery."
1.0,Did not fit my Kindle.
1.0,"Does not fit the Verizon LG G Pad 8.3 tablet, cutouts don't match"
1.0,Horrible power supply. Lasted less than 10 minutes. I wouldnt buy another. Bought a corsair power supply to replace and couldnt be happier with it. DO NOT BUY
1.0,"That price comes from the Name. I can get a PC for 7 k , not about 10k. Wanna know hardware of the 7k machine..<br />3.0 GHz i7-5960X Extreme Edition (20MB Cache – 8 Cores – 16 threads)<br />64 GB Quad Channel DDR4 at 2133MHz (8× 8GB)<br />2 x 12 GB GTX TITAN X with 3072 CUDA Cores = 24gb video ram<br />2 TB 2.5″ Solid State Drive<br />Asus X99-A/USB-3.1<br />16 TB 7200 rpm<br />Plus the wifi case and so on--<br />Price=$7,055.00"
1.0,It worked great for one month. After just one month of limited use it started to shut down out of the blue. Eventually it totally discharged. I was able to trickle charge back to full charge. It worked for a few days until it starting shuting down again. I was going to return but discovered that I was 5 days beyond the 30 day return policy. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon purchase. I have easily averaged over $1000 per year for past two or three years.
1.0,"Misleading thumbnail! i have not bought this product, if you are just looking to buy this product at a glance because the top portion says its a mechanical keyboard this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, it has membrane switches. with the supposed &quot;feel&quot; of mechanical switches."
1.0,"This charger gets extremely hot when being used, makes a buzzing sound, and is not safe. I would not recommend this device to anyone! DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Really disappointed that this only works with Windows 8.1 or Android 4+ OS.
1.0,Product stopped working after a day. Worst waste of money ever
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these, hoping at least 1 would work.  Wishful thinking on my part...  Both quit responding as I downloaded files to them, and could no longer be recognized by WIN7.  Windows offered the option of formatting the drives - at a maximum of 32GB.  This is a total scam..."
1.0,Does not eliminate the glare
1.0,"I have RCN in Chicago. Currently they are upgrading everyone to 110Mbps at the same monthly price as 50Mbps... PLUS they are requiring this equipment. Wired downloads are 100Mbps+, which is great. Wireless cannot get above 40Mbps. The tech specs claim that this modem is capable of 3x3 wireless (aka 450Mbps download over wifi)... but that is not possible with the current firmware, which RCN will NOT allow to be upgraded. I was getting faster Wifi with a 50Mbps provider speed and a cheaper router."
1.0,They worked great for about three weeks now they don't work at all buy something else these are junk
1.0,"A constant ping, ping, ping from the water hitting the top of the speaker whenever it was in use.<br />Very annoying"
1.0,Drive failed after 2 months. All 2 TB of data lost. Thanks Seagate for a quality product.
1.0,"got very hot shortly after i conneted it and just stopped working.....my power source is clean, not sure why ,maybe just got a lemon"
1.0,Really bad cables I wasted my money
1.0,"the enclosure looks very nice and the design makes it very easy to use, but very very unfortunately it did not work, at all.  I couldn't read the disk.<br />This is an update to my first review.  The Customer Service of Inateck contacted me right away with recommendations to test the enclosure to make sure that it doesn't work, and an offer to replace it, if it didn't work.  Unfortunately, I couldn't have followed their recommendations, because I did not have a HHD anymore, as I used the one in the enclosure to replace the internal HHD in my laptop.  At this point, I must rescind my previous review, because I wasn't able to test the enclosure all the way, and conclude its functionality.  I want to thank Inateck for the quick response to my comment and their technical support."
1.0,"Broke after 3-4 weeks with no damage, just randomly decided to stop. don't waste your money on this."
1.0,Drive is slower than SSDs purchased nearly 4 years ago.
1.0,"Opened package up, inserted TROND AC2 into my USB port........guess what???  It did NOT WORK!<br /><br />I returned it immediately and will NOT buy another product from this manufacturer."
1.0,"Looks nice but that's about it.  Felt cheap, hollow, and clunky.  update:   i like the size, shape, and buttons, but it still feels cheap and hollow it looses bluetooth sync often in windows 10"
1.0,We returned it because it was to small to hold a 17' laptop.
1.0,was not a good fit
1.0,"I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this one really deserves it. So, in hopes of saving some of you a little time and effort...do not buy this tablet! I'm no techie, so I spent A LOT of time looking into many different tablets and their functions, and after reading hundreds of reviews on different items, decided to purchase this NeuTab for my little person. My expectations were realistic, as I was looking for something to basically do homework, watch videos, and play games on.<br />So I powered this thing up, which came 100% charged (bonus), and right away noticed the not so great screen image. Read this in other reviews, so no surprise. But it was all downhill from there. It took at least 10 minutes to load some basic apps. Also there were three personal pictures on the tablet that looked like the inside of someones home in Asia, so I'm thinking this may have been a refurbished unit. Lastly, after turning this thing on only twice, it never powered up again, whuch meant I actually got to use it for less than an hour. Luckily, the return was super easy.<br /><br />Ended up spending a few more dollars for a smaller, but way better Samsung tablet. Save yourself some time and do the same."
1.0,I am disappointed in the size. I checked the specs before I purchased it and when it arrived to saying it &#34;fits snug&#34; for some models was an understatement. It doesn't even come close to fitting and my computer which is 15x10.2x.9.<br /><br />Ugh.
1.0,"This either ships from China, or just moves incredibly slow; I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume the former. It barely lasted a month; mine died last week. The clock was a fun novelty while it lasted, but don't expect the fan to actually move any air."
1.0,"bad, I never worked, has bug in the software"
1.0,"This is the card that came pre-installed in my Lenovo computer.  Since day one, it has randomly dropped my internet connection.  I have had to send the computer back once already, and they seemed to have fixed the issue for several months, and then lo and behold, it happened again.  Another quick visit, and then it was fixed again -- for a little.  You will find that it will get worse and worse, to the point that it will RELIABLY drop your internet connection during &#34;peak&#34; internet hours, several times a day.  Your connection will drop and then come back multiple times within the same few minutes, and then repeat within an hour.  Sometimes, it even gets so bad and causes so many internal hiccups that it causes your computer to go Blue Screen of Death on you.<br /><br />In short, find a better card.  This one is only good if you like to be frustrated."
1.0,Very disappointed in this purchase. It only worked for 2 months and cannot be returned.
1.0,Charger stopped working after charging twice.
1.0,"Battery doesn't charge all the way and dies in 30mins when not plugged in on Aug. 24, 2015"
1.0,Did not have a power supply and did not work
1.0,I really like the size ad look of the USB but I keep getting disconnected while transferring files. Its almost like its too loose and just doesn't fit right.
1.0,Not enough storage for kids
1.0,Wasn't able to use this
1.0,not a burner
1.0,Broke after 6 months of use
1.0,I'm very dissatisfied with the refurbished kindle I received today. I bought my kindle and canopy insurance in Jan. 2014. I paid well over five hundred dollars for it. Three days ago it quit charging so I called canopy to report my problem. This is the first time I have had to make a claim and they allow you three. Today I received my replacement kindle and when I opened it it stated it was refurbished. This is what is making me angry. I have roughly five months left on my insurance and it took a little over a year and a half for my first one to develope problems. I didn't spill anything on it or drop it or do anything to cause this problem. Now I own a refurbished kindle and wonder how long this one will work before before having problems. If it does I will purchase a I Pad as I know a few people who own one and have had no problems although they are over two years old. Thanks for nothing Amazon
1.0,"Looks cool, but sounds hallow. The sub adds no true bass. I purchased a Logitech x220 in 2004 and they just stopped working a month ago. Still the best computer speakers I've ever heard. Unfortunately these were a poor replacement."
1.0,"I was under the impression that I was buying a new computer since no were in the description did it say that it was a refurbished computer. Have only had it for 3 months and the hard drive was corrupted so I had to pay to get a new hard drive installed. After all was done, the money I spent on this computer would have bought me a really nice new computer plus some extras. If you are wanting to by an HP, I suggest buying it from an authorized dealer and not amazon."
1.0,"WIFI drops constantly. So I updated newest firmware to see if it fixed anything. Huge mistake, backup file would not work at all with the new firmware. Had to redo every single setting. WIFI dropping issue was still there, very annoying. Technical supports were clueless. Stay away from this router at all cost."
1.0,Screen cracked at the corner after a 2 foot drop ... Boo
1.0,Terrible product! My daughter received it as a gift and the battery keeps dying and there is no storage to speak of.  Spend a bit more and buy an iPad.
1.0,"This is a review of the *bundle*, not the actual NUC.<br /><br />The RAM is cheap Chinese crap that offers extremely poor performance. Loading Windows 8 on this thing is like trying to run the OS on a Pentium II - it's bad.<br /><br />Save your sanity by buying the bare device and purchasing high quality memory and SSD instead."
1.0,"Bad product. It isn't just the cable, the hard drive is showing up in the Devices section in Windows, isn't populating in My Computer. Used primarily on my Xbox One. Do not get this product. Not worth it."
1.0,Can't format to fat32 as they describe that you can and that the sd card could be formatted
1.0,"I do not usually write reviews, actually this is my first on Amazon.<br />I bought this one after reading many positive reviews here.<br />I was going to use it with Windows 10 to talk to Cortana instead of my Webcam mic and to use it to record high quality sounds as well.<br />But guess what:<br />1- you should talk to it directly to catch your sound, even when the volume control all way up (PC+Mic)<br />2- it has a very bad static noise (There is NO noise cancellation whatsoever)<br /><br />My webcam do a very much better than this one although it is connected to Asus Xonar sound card, I'm very disappointed<br />And As I live outside US I can't return this garbage, what a waste!"
1.0,"I'm disappointed that my warranty did not provide a new Kindle but a refurbished one.  This Kindle worked great for about two months then started making odd noises, shuts off on its own, and kicks me out of what I was doing with it.  And since my previous extended warranty expired is this &#34;refurbished&#34; one covered with a warranty as if it was new?????  If so Amazon needs to send me another New one to replace what had been previously covered under a purchased warranty.<br /><br />I have really enjoyed my Kindle's quite a bit and even purchased them for family members.  Amazon please make this right."
1.0,It was not an oem HP battery . Did not fit right and would not charge.
1.0,Worked for about a week and then quit. Glad I didn't pay much at all but it would have been nice to have an extra charger for my phone.
1.0,too slow
1.0,Does not charge at the proper wattage.  Do not buy.
1.0,Just awful. The power of the fan is so weak to cool down the computer. Please do not waste your money on this product.
1.0,Absolute piece of crap. My phone barely charges due to &#34;Accessory device not compatible with this phone&#34;. tip of charger broke off in my phone. And I had to wait 3 weeks to even get them. Don't waste your $.
1.0,it doesnt work & i wasnt sent the high speed cables
1.0,Did not fit my daughters tablet. Had to pay shipping to get it and to send it back! Not happy!
1.0,"I purchase this as a gift for a friend. Once I pass the Tablet onto my Friend, they were not able to use it, since the start button had broken on the first power on."
1.0,First cable I bought did not work. Had to buy another manufacturer's cable to confirm the problem was in the cable from Cable Matters. Cable Matters sent a replacement of the first cable...eventually. The second cable from Cable Matters worked fine...for a day. That one too has now failed. Nothing is touching the cables. No stress on the connections. (The other manufacturer's cable worked over weeks without issues.  Going back to that other manufacturer's cable.)
1.0,"Ok i have had this board awhile and  to be frank I hate it..It takes too long to acknowledge I hot the  power button to turn my pc on.. It's slow ..I have  amd  fx 8 core 4.0 ghz , geforce 960 superclocked 4gb ram and  still 16gbs or ram 1866 each  stick and yet i am unable to open  windows  in a decent time  ..I am far from happy this is the only motherboard from asus I have bought that has given me such headaches.. I have  gotten gigabit  but stopped cause of the fact their ports blow in like 6 months So I thought to buy Asus again and now I am stuck with a motherboard that  is not good .. I got this board to replace my old one after it fried  from my  fx 8 core processor and it was a decent price as I am on a limited income"
1.0,"the item above lasted only about 20 copys or duplications before the reader drive failed.so I read the writing on the wall, and sent it back.won't reorder till the industry gets it together.See all makers of duplicators share the same components.So i'll do without.Thanks."
1.0,I bought this item for my  MSI GP 70 Leopard 486.  I installed it but my computer  didn't recognize it.  I installed the drivers but still nothing.  I don't know if I need to buy a UBS adapter just send it back because it's defective.  I wrote to technical support  but sorry guys I don't have a 4 year degree in computer science.<br />  I wonder if only geeks buy this item
1.0,Top handle ripped within a week. So dissatisfied with this purchase.
1.0,doesn't stay in.  have to hold it in for it to charge!  waste of money.
1.0,Good afternoon. I made a purchase of one (1) SanDisk Cruzer Blade CZ50 8GB USB 2.0 Flash and failed me. I wonder what happened???
1.0,DO NOT BUY!  The disk is locked and you have to jump through dozens of hoops and call tech support to unlock it!  All of these favorable reviews are false!  You can't use the drive!  It's locked!  Amazon is selling you defective drives!
1.0,Didn't like the color and it wasn't as expected.
1.0,This keyboard worked for about 2 weeks before breaking down couldn't even type worst purchase ever don't buy this
1.0,"So I bought this for my 2 in 1 13inch windows laptop. After I used it the inside of this sleeve stained the chrome fiber on my laptop on the rims. I think it was the dye possibly used on the soft inside of this sleeve that caused this rusty look on my beautiful 2 in 1. I was so angry! Now I hardly use it or when I do I try to make sure my laptop is 100% cooled down if ever I use it. The upside I like is that it is a hard sleeve, still it is bendable."
1.0,"They said the battery was new, no new battery only lasts 2hrs., fully charged. I will never buy from them again....."
1.0,"I'm updating the below review. This keyboard has a mind of its own. A few months after I bought it, it starting typing extra letters, periods, and spaces. I'd try to backspace, but then it would erase too much!  Worthless piece of junk. Spend more, and get a better case and keyboard. I now HAVE to.   Original Review: This case is really neat and sturdy. I was very surprised by how heavy it was, which I like because I wanted something that wasn't flimsy. My one complaint is that the keyboard is a little awkward. Compared to the the spacebar, the keys are off centered and this throws me off a little. In addition to the keyboard, a letter gets stuck occasionally even though I'm not pressing it, and it types out about 20 of the same letter. Besides this, I'm quite satisfied so far."
1.0,It's not waterproof!
1.0,Won't work :(
1.0,It was broken.  They never stated that on the information.
1.0,"This thing is junk.  Connects to the network at a random Mbps, and pings to google.com give me high ping times and packet loss.  Tried it on two computers with the same results.  Don't bother with this one and just get something from a better brand."
1.0,Buy this if you are looking for a completely unreliable wireless router that you have to reset 8 times a day. So awesome. I love spending a chunk of money and then having that product end up being a flimsy piece of crap that doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Hunk. Of. Junk.
1.0,"As soon as I plug it in, it started making noise. I'm worried that it'll explode or something. Definitely return it!"
1.0,This product is garbage!!
1.0,"Delivered opened, with no return label or packing slip. Only works when it wants to, and when in the same room as our router. Kind of defeats the purpose of a portable 2-in-1! Waste of $300, and a huge disappointment from Amazon. I am super-angry, but have no recourse. This is totally unacceptable!!!"
1.0,"If I could rate it less than 1, I would have.  I have had a number of computer users try to get the problem resolved for me. The last one was while I was on vacation, and my great (or is it grand, which she is) niece (who's Very Good at computers!) worked for 3 days on it and couldn't get it to work. Her mom took pity on me and got me an Apple keyboard which works!!!! They both suggested I return the Newstyle. It's obviously no use to me. It LOOKED good, but didn't turn out that way. Now, how do I return it?"
1.0,Does not charge. Waste of money.
1.0,it worked maybe a week! very disappointed
1.0,Does not work at all still waiting for refund
1.0,iPhone 6 shows error - cable not certified- does not work
1.0,"I bought 2 on July 20 2015, started using the first on July 30.<br /><br />On August 21 it died.  Suddenly I started to have problems to save documents.  To my surprise the SD was not recognized.<br /><br />I went to windows, but no volumen was recognized.  With recuva recovered some of my family pictures, but all was trashed.<br /><br />Then I tried to format.  A quick format worked, but again, trying to restore a backup the card when to unreachable on windows.<br /><br />So I did a complete format, but it always failed at around 20%.<br /><br />I tried on 2 different machines same result.<br /><br />After that the card become totally unreadable.<br /><br />I didn't expected a Samsung Memory Card to die too quick.  Now I started to use the second, let's see if my luck changes with this new one.<br /><br />:-("
1.0,Mine died (no power) after only a year and 2 months....range was ok but never great (router was upstairs; extender was downstairs..even tried it right at the bottom of the stairs). Says it has a 2-year warranty so I am going to submit it to Belkin for an exchange.
