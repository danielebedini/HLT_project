overall,reviewText
4.0,I am not sure I don't know if it is the tablet or lollipop.  Sometimes I can't get a good connection.  Otherwise I do like it.  It does almost everything I want.  els well made.  I have one of there computers and I thought this was a good buy and was thinking that there computer was good.
4.0,Love that Finite makes different designs and that the grooves are pretty deep to hold the IPad Air up. That's why I bought the case. But...the auto awake and shut off does not work with my case and not sure why. So I have to set auto-lock in the iPad settings just so it shuts off with inactivity.
4.0,This is pretty much what I wanted. A backpack that was slimmer than the Ful backpack I previously used. I miss the multiple zippered compartments though. I wish there were more quick access front pockets although the lumbar pocket is pretty handy so far.
4.0,"Great laptop. got it for the wife for her birthday. No issues thus far. However, we paid only $323.00 for this at the Microsoft store in June. That's $200 less than the price here. $520 is way out of line for this laptop."
4.0,It works for its price. Can't complain.
4.0,"This was bought for my 5yr old. His class uses an online program for schoolwork. It is very thin and lightweight. We keep it a leather folio cover. It is very easy for him to use, Except, he doesn't always remember to hold the power button down to turn it on. We bought one in black and one in blue. They're both a great affordable option."
4.0,Perfect compatibility.
4.0,It took a week to get it delivered but it kit was new and worked great.
4.0,"I still recall the day I upgraded my 20GB Xbox 360 HD with a 100GB HD and thinking, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34; Fast forward 4 years, lots of Rock Band DLC and the ability to store full games to the HD and I find myself at about 90% full. Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process."
4.0,I use this keyboard as a keyboard for my test bench (Where I work on computers to repair them) and it works great! They keys are a bit mushy and close to the edge but overall for the price this keyboard is great. The plastic is high quality and so are the key caps and connector. Would buy again if I ever needed anything like it.
4.0,good product
4.0,nice pfoduct
4.0,"I had to return this (for a reason I can't recall, sorry, but I think it wasn't due to any problems with the keyboard itself).  I'm pretty sure it worked fine, although I don't like the way they position the Enter key.  Apparently I'm used to Dell keyboards because I've used them for decades and now i'm used to the Enter key being horizontally long and the \ key being above it.  But it seems like most keyboards that I see these days have them switched, so when I use them I keep hitting / instead of Enter and it's infuriating.<br /><br />Sooner or later I'll have to adjust since it appears to be the standard for newer keyboards.  Gotta start reaching farther out for that Enter key!"
4.0,Cords don't last very long. Disappointment
4.0,"Works as advertised, but don't get this type of device if you're hoping to capture signatures."
4.0,good
4.0,"such small, much storage, wow"
4.0,"Bought this to extend the life of an old laptop with a dead internal fan.  Without the Opolar fan, CPU temps were cresting 170°F.  With the Opolar even running at lowest manual speed, temps rarely go above 120°. With the speed tuned up a few clicks, it's rarely above 110°.  I'm really impressed with the effectiveness.<br />The &#34;auto&#34; fan speed function seems like a great idea, but unfortunately it requires a working laptop fan for it to operate.  This seems odd since I imagine that most people buy this (like I did) to replace the cooling function of a dead fan, not as a fan booster.  The auto fan speed control senses the temperature of the air being directed out of the laptop -- perhaps a future version could incorporate a temperature sensor cable that could be placed inside the laptop vent to directly sense the internal temps and control the auto fan speed that way.<br />Pros:  Simple connect and attach. Works really well at keeping laptop CPU temperatures under control. Reasonably quiet even at high speed.<br />Cons: The arms that clamp the device to the side of the laptop could be longer.  They're short enough that the weight of the Opolar itself can sometimes work them loose.  And the previously mentioned auto-speed function not working without a working internal fan.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a well crafted product and I'd recommend it."
4.0,It lasted me a long time and it works just fine.<br />My only issue was that it stopped working after a few months and there were no signs of damage. But it did what it had to do and works fine.
4.0,Just what i liked
4.0,I like case
4.0,"These work well and are incredibly useful, be it for plugging in external storage, a keyboard and/or mouse, or even a USB gamepad. The two-pack is handy, too, but the wires on the micro USB end became exposed on mine because of the angle the connector is at; a little wire glue will fix it up, though."
4.0,This mouse is great little mouse. i like the shape and the buttons. The scroll wheel works well and the dpi switch works fine. I am a male and have a large size glove hand (I don't wear them when mousing) and this mouse is unfortunately too small for me to use comfortably. I kept searching for a good position and was either too far forward or too far back. About 15% to 20% bigger and it would be perfect for me. For anyone with a medium or smaller hand I am sure it would be great.
4.0,I bought this case for its unique shape and color. Fit a full board and 5 fans installed . Feels kinda cheap but sturdy enough for a build . My two complains are the front usb issues I had. First the 3.0 has a usb male connection that if I didn't buy the usb to pin converter to install on my board it would take a usb slot on the back of your Mobo and you'll have a cable sticking out also. 2nd for the love of everything the usb 2.0 would not work on the pin above the power reset had to use an alternative .. I have a problem with cable management I hate seeing cables so I'm proud that you can barely see any.. Recommend if you go the route I went with to fix my minor complaints .
4.0,Thank you
4.0,Thank you
4.0,"Love it. Obviously there are a few things that could be better, but they probably have them in the more inclusive models."
4.0,"Forward slash key takes a few repeated keystrokes to work.  Other than that, great keyboard.  I love using the lighting of it at night.  Thanks!"
4.0,Very good
4.0,"love the neat size and legibility. i do wish it had colour though. bought it thinking it would be good for graphic novels, books with art illustrations etc.  So less than six months later I've got a damaged screen, probably my own fault because i placed it in my bag without pulling the cover down. Something probably pressed against the screen and now i've got a blank area in the top left corner which basically makes it unreadable. Sigh. I need a new screen now."
4.0,"I was surprised at how light this product is. Once the cables are plugged into the back, it has trouble staying upright. It would be nice if Trendnet provided a snap-on base of some kind. Since I'm only using it as a wired router in my network, I turned off the wireless radio and so I can't comment on that. For my wireless I am using a hi-end Asus as an access point at the other end of my house. Trendnet's user interface is mostly fine, much better than the one on my previous router. I assume that the firewall is always on, since there's no option to turn it on or off. Overall this is an affordable router giving you gigabit wired speeds, the newer IPv6 protocol, and dual-band wireless, though I can't say how well that works."
4.0,Works fine
4.0,OK it works like it is supposed to.
4.0,Not easy to use 3rd party backup software with.
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if I could stop the colors from changing. I don't know why they thought people would watn their mouse constantly changing colors. Otherwise, works great for the price."
4.0,"After my laptop keyboard went caput, this was a lifesaver!"
4.0,This case provides bare minimum protection to my Kindle but allows it to be inserted in stand purchased elsewhere.
4.0,Cool backpack for the school!
4.0,"Worked perfectly with all my official MSPDs, not so well with my knockoff Chinese ones. This is annoying because every OTHER device I have works fine with those memsticks. I can't fault this device for not working with them, though. With an official MSPD in it, operation is FAST and flawless. The clear cap doesn't really stay on the end after you've used it for a while, though."
4.0,It works well and does not talk back.
4.0,"I bought these for my daughters for road trips and downtime.  I got them during the sale, so I figured for $70 it's hard to go wrong.  The devices are sturdy, work well and you can get most apps in the Amazon Store.  The kicker is, you really need a separate Amazon account for each person to operate it correctly.  I set up some temporary emails and then accounts for each of them, with no method of payment.  I can still monitor all the activity since I have access to those accounts.  The kid profile under your own account just doesn't work."
4.0,"A nice solid laptop. For the price you can't expect much, the pre-order price made a it a no brainer, you would be hard pressed to find another laptop sub $400 with a full 1080p display. Battery life seems to be about 3 hours from my experience, that's a combo of installing application, web browsing and writing code.  If you don't have any intention of gaming, you will find this to be a wonderful laptop. The integrated Intel, while they are progressing, can't hold a candle to a real dedicated GPU. Battery life isn't as great as I was hoping, but not bad. It can still be mobile, but not the 5-6 hours I've had in a nice quad core i7 mac book pro from way back in 2011. The hard drive does seem fast enough for normal use. Keyboard is okay, not great but seems to work for what I need.  Pros 1080p &#60;-- this is what pushes it to the top of the budget laptops in my book. (developer) Pretty thin and lite. Enough processing power. Enough memory.  Cons, not really cons just really considerations. It's a mobile i3, not for heavy processing. 4gb of memory, I routinely see 60-70% usage 5,400rpm drive, not a deal breaker but in the world of SSD's, its pretty slow. Trackpad feels pretty cheap.  There is some extra junk installed, but it wasn't hard to remove. I have since ordered another 4gb stick of memory and a SSD but have not installed it yet. From what I've found out the upgrade process is a lot more work than it should be. Also I have not been able to find any real specs or manual online or in the box for this specific model to tell you things like, the max memory supported etc.  This is all subjective to my experience, your mileage will vary.  After having read my review, it's pretty indecisive. I want to say that for normal day to day use, it will serve you well. Just no gaming or heavy processing."
4.0,"handy little flash drive, but the hinge doesnt seem like it will last forever... to be clear it hasnt broken on me, but I wouldve liked the hinge to be more substancial"
4.0,"Looks nice, but when I plug in my iPhone 5s indicates this charger cable is not Apple certified. Additionally, my charging block heats up beyond normal."
4.0,"I really like these speaker, the fact they were USB threw me, as I am no tech junkie, and they are not the loudest even at full volume but this hard of hearing old man can hear them quite well and they put out good sound."
4.0,"A good quality memory for smartphones and tablets,  comes with adapter for pc too"
4.0,"Awesome little addition to my desktop.  Was very easily plug and play and it reads everything I've put into it so far (CAC card and SD card).  Only complaint is the speed at which it transfers information from PC to SD card (could be the card, will have to see) and that the screws for the mounting bracket for those of us who don't have a 3.5 bay are too far forward, preventing this guy from sitting flush in my case.  Other than that, no complaints.  Great product."
4.0,For the price gets the job done. Ended up tossing the keyboard cover- it smudges my screen.
4.0,Well worth the price.
4.0,"2 years' use from mine so far, with no issues. Runs whatever I plug into it, never makes anything give me a 'low power from port' warning. Never causes any problems when hot-swapping stuff. It's on par with the Belkin hubs from back in the day. Best powered hub for the value, IMO."
4.0,The kid loved it!!
4.0,Feels a little cheap but that's probably because it has lots of vents for air flow. It's very quiet and it isn't too bad to have on your lap.
4.0,"I was surprised by this monitor. I was really not expecting something so good. It is sturdy, the resolution is amazing and it seems to work just great."
4.0,This is my 2nd one.  Works as advertised with no issues whatsoever.
4.0,"Short simple and sweet, this is an enjoyable device to use. This runs windows 10 beautifully. If you do run windows 10, make sure you download the drivers of of Asus website for the T100TAM.<br /><br />Supports stylus but will lag with drawing applications that Ive tested. Battery life is really really really good.<br /><br />The only downside is that it smudges easily, and browsing PDF files in portrait mode doesnt scale to screen. (using adobe reader )<br />Overall, great device, and a lot of bang for the price."
4.0,IN THE TOOL BOX
4.0,good
4.0,great buy. This is my second Kindle Fire. I gave the 1st one to my daughter and now we share books
4.0,good
4.0,"Rally like it, it got here in a week charges great and is very cheap and made from good material."
4.0,Don't recommend plug in external hard drive to this device.
4.0,Very good quality case. Withstood multiple drops and no cracks at all.
4.0,all ok
4.0,"I updated my old computer because I was unable to play some of the newer games on the market. This was reasonably priced and gets the job done. It's not the newest and the best, but it does what I want. And you can't beat the price."
4.0,Definitely helps with wrist problems.
4.0,"The size of the mouse pad is great, as it lets my hand move around quite a bit without the mouse losing contact with the pad.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after several months of use, the fabric on the top of the mousepad (where my wrist sits) slowly starts to degrade. Because the mousepad is black, the fading is very obvious. I haven't been able to find a fix for it yet.<br /><br />That being said, I will probably purchase another one of these."
4.0,"The plug is great, the wire is a little wimpy, but it works well."
4.0,"Lightweight, easy to hold, & easy to put kindle in & take out"
4.0,"Works just fine, did the job as advertised at a good priced."
4.0,It does charge my tablet but it fits into the tablet loosely.
4.0,Good performance and quality.
4.0,Bought this as last ditch effort to save my hard disk data from non working laptop Dell N5010. It worked really well with my hard disk. Was able to read all the data. Worked like a charm.<br /><br />Thanks!
4.0,It's taking me a while to get use to the key pad ( it's a bit small) color is clear easy to hold also.
4.0,"The cable appeared to be well made with quality materials. The connectors securely attached to the hard drive and the motherboard. My desktop's chassis has very tight quarters for the hard drives, so the 90-degree connector worked great for that tight space."
4.0,Price was good product was as promised.
4.0,Inexpensive and very competent<br />I would buy again
4.0,Exactly as described.
4.0,Works better than expected
4.0,"I love the long cable, but it is a little loose when connected."
4.0,"It took me 4 minutes to get Authorixation web page, and then a couple more to have Comcast finalize.it. I did not need all the serial, model #'s. Just entered my account and wala.<br />FYI I am getting approx. 4% faster speed...for free!"
4.0,"Not much to say really as it arrived on time and it works.  I actually used it to replace the battery in a tire pressure sensor on my motorcycle so had to remove the yellow protective covering, which is quite thick btw, and cut the plug off to solder to the TPS circuit board but it works fine."
4.0,This seemed to work very well for us.
4.0,I can't remember so this does it for me
4.0,good batteries
4.0,Good product but color isnt as shown. I picked the blue and it looks like a robins egg blue or a sky blue and when it came its a very dull light medium blue. Definitely would have chosen another color if I would have lnown but other than that is a good case.
4.0,"Cable gets the job done at a cheap price, it does feel very cheap as well, but it works so who cares."
4.0,"The decal sticker that your going to get is ok, when this is all you can afford. The nice thing is if you don't line it up right you can re-apply it over and over and it will still stick."
4.0,This would have 5 stars but it's little to no padding on the bottom.  The inside is very soft and plush on the sides with lots of padding.  The bottom however is just the fabric. I feel they messed up with that.  I am going to try and find a piece of foam to glue along the bottom.  I have an hp specter x360 and it's a 13in laptop so lots of room.  I also have the Amazon basics sleeve.  I put the laptop into the sleeve and the sleeve into this bag and things fit great.
4.0,"Pro's---this product is an exact fit,for my ipad air.<br />I'm verrry happy..also..lov the functionality of it..it does n looks just like the pic,on amazon..quick shippn tooo..<br />Cons--- in the pic..it looks like where it closes.. and has a velcro latch..not soo.. it's just a canvas loop that you can barely put your finger in.. I'm not too sure, what it's for!<br />And it's very slippery.. it has slid off my chair.. quite a few times.."
4.0,"I was worried that the Rockchip processor would hinder this machine, but I was wrong.  The battery life is amazing, and this machine is fast!<br /><br />I wish it had a 1080p screen, but for 11 inches and only 169, I cant ask for much.  Great machine!"
4.0,nice for lots of photos
4.0,"This was bought for our 7yr old. His class uses an online program for schoolwork. This is his second tablet as he destroyed his first one last year. So far it's held up really well. It's kept in a leather folio case. He did already break the charger by bending it. It's easy for him to use & processes quickly. It's not as overloaded with junk as some tablets. It is thin & very lightweight. Overall, a great affordable option."
4.0,No problems so far.
4.0,Good sized mouse. Love the fact that you can select a single color. Only gripe with it is that you have to keep selecting the color every time you restart your computer. It will for whatever reason reset back to multi color once pc is turned off.
4.0,Fantastic range.  Works great to feed my phone into my home stereo.  The only thing I wish this product had was an on/off switch.
4.0,"Good, but the unnecessary holes on the bottom make it easy for dust to get underneath the case, but more importantly, the holes grab the hairs on your thighs if your the type of guy that likes to work in your boxer briefs and sets your laptop on your lap.  I've gone as far as to shave the front of my thighs to prevent the plucking of my hairs, which does work, but granted that I am a rather body hairless man, I can imagine the more furry the man, , if you will, the more odd this shave pattern may appear.<br /><br />BTW, the two little legs on the back are surprisingly sturdy, when I do decide to work fully clothed at a desk.  I do enjoy typing at an angle."
4.0,smooth operation and handles detail work for Photoshop very well.
4.0,nice picture no problems.
4.0,"Good quality.  Has a design flaw.  The front support pegs push up into the case, cause the case to fall over (forward)."
4.0,This case fits really tight. The magnetic strip allows two different angles for watching movies or working. It's really slim and protects the entire face.
4.0,Does its job.<br />Kinda tight until broken in but it is good.
4.0,The charge doesn't last quite as long as advertised but the light works well & clips onto my book making reading in bed enjoyable without disturbing my spouse asleep next to me.
4.0,Product worked fine.  The directions do not explain well enough on how to open the box.  To open:  put BOTH thumbs on right side of box and slide forward with pressure ONLY on the right side.  (the right side when &#34;window&#34; is toward you).
4.0,It's good. Great size. I love it for the most part. Don't like that it can't play audio books. Don't like the adds but that's  ok if you get the Amazon kindle case and disable the lock screen by  typing ~ds in the search bar.
4.0,"durable leather handle, the plastic stand underneath the leather handle is a little fragile that broke quickly."
4.0,Great for cheap USB 3.0 drive with decent read speed of ~124MB/s but the writes speeds are slow at ~24MB/s.
4.0,Nice in terms of size and sound. Idel for the beach.
4.0,"Works like it should. Used it to make a recovery disk for my PC, no problems at all."
4.0,As described
4.0,Feels great! The only warning I have is when zipped keep the zippers to the top and be mindful how you open the case. Your computer can accidentally fall. If you are cautious this case is great!
4.0,Ok
4.0,"Even though the point resolution is not that great, everything else works fine."
4.0,Pretty decent. It's good at cancelling outside noises. The sound sounds nice and sound hehe.
4.0,Work with my MBP15&#34; 2009-2011.
4.0,"I really like this keyboard.  Colors are great and the gentle tapping of the keys is appreciated.  Nothing worse than listening to  bunch of tick,ticking all day.  I do however wish the colors were brighter.  They look great in the dark, but who works in the dark???"
4.0,"Not the greatest nude, a bit pinker than I thought, but accurately described. I love the Kate line of Rimmel. They are rich in color."
4.0,"This wireless keyboard is a great thing for home theater PCs. However, the signal strength on my keyboard was pretty pathetic. You need good line of sight from the receiver, and it won't work reliably beyond a few feet. But the price is right for the purpose, and I use it every day!<br /><br />As for the trackpad, it seems fine. As good as many laptops I've used. The buttons aren't very tactile and feel kind of rubbery to press, but you get used to it.<br /><br />The keyboard is not something you should use at your desk for typing papers and reports. Get yourself a real keyboard for some real work. This is a consumption device, not a production one."
4.0,Wel made.
4.0,"Like other AmazonBasics items I have purched, this cable is solidly built, does its job, and is affordable."
4.0,"I love my new headphones! The only thing I wish was that there was a microphone.  Or if there is one,  I haven't figured it out yet.  :) Shipped in good time too."
4.0,Display is large and clear.  Easy to operate.  A bargain.
4.0,So far this works as advertised. No complaints.
4.0,Works fine overall. Sometimes I have issues getting the games out.
4.0,Works great with Plex. Using Ready Cloud app to access your movies in your readynas needs updating. Please have desktop readycloud app for Mac osx available.
4.0,Functioning power supply ~ We bought this for our small computer case.
4.0,"Haven't had much time with it yet, but it gets the job done."
4.0,"First one died after 10 minutes of use.  RMA was easy, and the second one works great and is fast.  This is the first time I have had a problem with samsung memory, so this is the first 4 star review I am giving them."
4.0,"Nothing special, but it works"
4.0,Just finished pulling 4000 ft of this cable through new construction and didn't have any issues.  I would recommend that as you get closer to the end of the spool you will want to unroll the length of cable you need and stretch it out.  This will help keep the cable from kinking.  This is common sense with almost any ethernet vendor.  I would purchase this again.
4.0,Good Hight Quality.
4.0,Love that the battery doesn't die while I'm reading.  Two things that would make this even better:<br /><br />1. a button to adjust contrast/brightness. (screen is a bit dark)<br /><br />2. 4G with this would be WAY better than wifi
4.0,Nice and sturdy good looking bag. Must be used with a pack/shoulder bag to transport as there iz no handle or pockets. But it will suffice.
4.0,"The color looks a little different from the screen, but it's nice anyway, and can protect my writing tablet"
4.0,the fans are not quite as strong as i would have liked but it seems to be working fine so i have no complaint.
4.0,pretty! and very useful
4.0,"The bag looks nice and professional, it also holds a lot along with the laptop."
4.0,does not last as long as expected for such a big batterry
4.0,I like how this worked and protected my tablet...in fact it is the 2nd one I bought...its a decent product...1st one lasted about a year
4.0,computer is OK most graphic cards will not fit the motherboard
4.0,good product
4.0,"The power supply wasn't providing power correctly at first, then started working. Try to keep it from bending too much as it is as flimsy in the connection area as the original piece."
4.0,Worked exactly how I needed it too.  Was extremely convenient to remove a MacBook Pro screen.  It would be nice if it were a hair smaller so it could be used for smaller electronics too.
4.0,Did not realize you have to pay a annual fee also alot of advertisement  on this
4.0,Looks durable.
4.0,"I selected this product for two reasons:  1) the presence of an on/off switch and, 2) toolless installation of drives.<br /><br />The on/off switch is important because I prefer a controlled way of removing power from a drive and toolless installation means it's easy to swap out drives.<br /><br />That said, it is a bit difficult to open.  The whole top slides off and there isn't much to grab onto.  By the product's design it appears intended to be a semi-permanent enclosure for a HDD.  In this role it is superb.  However, if your needs require frequently changing out the HDD you may wish to look to a product expressly designed for that purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I like the unit and appreciate that the manufacturer included a foam rectangle to place on top of the HDD to help prevent it from working loose during movement.  With the foam in place the unit feels rock solid and the HDD does not shift at all inside the enclosure."
4.0,I bought this on Amazon Prime so I ended up buying the 16gb one for $95.  The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.
4.0,Great product! Good value!
4.0,its memory.<br />they worked out of the package.<br />they had the requisite space available.
4.0,Does the job nicely and feels solidly built too!
4.0,Works pretty well.  The white leather-like finish likes to show dirt after a short period of use.  Functionally works very well.
4.0,no issues with installation. Very simple to install.
4.0,Great antenna for the price. Held up to it's specs exactly. Nice mount for indoors and good length of coax already attached.
4.0,"Bought it for Lenovo Yoga 3. So far so good: it fits well, the charging is in progress."
4.0,Sound quality is as expected for 10 dollar speakers
4.0,"We did not get any special offers with our Kindle fire, only certain stores had that offer.  My husband does like it though."
4.0,good product
4.0,"The card was a bit difficult to install because it did not fit the PCI port perfectly. I had to unscrew the two screws and &#34;shorten&#34; the card by sliding it closer to the metal plate cover. After i made the modification, it was a snug fit, but it fit."
4.0,"Assembling the unit was not super easy, but I am a computer builder and got it put together in about an hour.  I did have a hard time getting it to install windows, but that was getting the right bootable USB going.  It's running Windows 10 very nicely!  The wireless keyboard I plugged in worked immediately."
4.0,Easy to hook up. Works great!
4.0,It is very comfortable to read and handy to refer to dictionary and Wiki. But it works not well for those non-kindle files.
4.0,"While I haven't purchased this laptop directly, my company, Georgetown Mortgage in Georgetown Texas, purchased these laptops for several years and I have supported these laptops in detail. I have taken many of these apart and have done fairly in depth troubleshooting as well as upgrading.<br /><br />Overall the 5540 is a decent laptop. It works fairly well. Over all if the laptop is taken well care of it will give years of good service.  While I'm not a huge Dell fan, I have learned to work around the issues that their laptops present and this one tends to have only a few.<br /><br />The main issue we had with this laptop is not really a big issue for the average user who doesn't take their computer apart, but for those of us who like to upgrade our laptops, the E5540 is a bit of a pain.<br /><br />If you decide to upgrade your memory, HDD or WiFi, the laptop is particularly difficult to take the back off. Some people could have seriously issues getting it off and the clips sometimes refuse to let go without prying tools. I have broken tabs off of more than one of these. I created a video for our end users that you might find useful in showing the process of removing the cover: https://youtu.be/hqz2ApVrAQ4<br />Keep in mind this is not the most difficult cover I've ever removed. Some of the old older laptops win that category.<br /><br />On the subject of memory installs, we had many issues with the E5540 and memory. It says that it will take dual voltage memory but we had many issues where it would not take this kind of memory. Apparently the laptop would read the high power mode (1.5v) and fail to even turn on. Matching two dual-voltage mode SODIMMs would usually fix the problem, but definitely don't mix a PC3L and a dual mode chip.<br /><br />Regarding software issues: When it comes to drivers, Dell's drivers are usually fine. The only exception is the Intel PROset drivers. We experienced issues with the drivers that came on the laptop. Whenever the laptop would go to sleep, the Wireless drivers would fail and the device would appear to be uninstalled. Disabling/Re-enabling the device in the Device Manager or rebooting the laptop would fix the issue. The permanent fix was to update the Intel PROset drivers to the latest version (17.14+). This stopped the issue entirely.<br /><br />Other than that, the laptop is pretty standard in it's setup. There may be issues that I don't know about, but the only real issue we had with these laptops is the track pad on some laptops would die requiring a replacement.<br /><br />Durability was pretty good though they rarely survived a fall. Usually something would break or the screen would crack. Seemed like maybe the screen was a little more susceptible to cracking, but that's a hard one to call as corporate users are not known to be easy on laptops. Home users should experience little trouble with this as long as they take good care of their laptop.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up. If you never have a trackpad issue, you keep your vents clear, and you never need to upgrade it, you should get a very long life out of this laptop.go to sleep, the Wireless drivers would fail and the device would appear to be uninstalled.

4.0,I like it so far -- time will tell how long the bearings and brushes will last. I have it on top of one  computer case that has a spare USB from the motherboard.
4.0,"Overall, the best motherboard I could find for a gaming and a video editing setup.<br />I dislike a couple things however, there is a weird pop noise when the machine turns itself on that is motherboard related and it is noted in other reviews as well. Some say its coming from the onboard audio, I haven't located the cause yet.<br />Also, while I don't think it affects anything, there appears to be some sort of odd error code in Windows Event Viewer thats noted on the ASUS forums that says the EC controller returned data when there wasn't any asked of it, and a BIOS upgrade is suggested. I have the latest BIOS and it still has this error.<br /><br />I also had odd issues with the onboard video as I had monitor flickering(whether that be flickering, or a black screen every so often)<br />This video problem was fixed when i put in a nvidia gfx card, so that tells me something is wrong with the onboard video and I half considered RMAing the board but decided against it when the graphics card fixed the problem."
4.0,"battery pack seems to work fine.  However due to the increased amp hr rating, it is much bulkier than the original.  It's easily twice as thick as the original and tilts the laptop more than I would like"
4.0,"This is the neatest trickiest little thing that I've had for a long time. I absolutely love it. It gets your laptop off the desk enough for the space to be useable for other things while letting you still work on the laptop. Four stars instead of 5 because the small rubber feet are almost too small for my laptop to lean on, but it works. You lose that neck pain because your screen is up where it needs to be. Excellent product. I'll be ordering more for our tablets and other things around the house. This is a great product."
4.0,"Good monitor, however it can't be mounted which is a bummer."
4.0,It showed up on time. It fits and works great.
4.0,Thank you for being affordable..
4.0,works great and got it quickly.
4.0,"Very Satisfying computer. I was going to build my own but humans are inherently lazy so looked around for a decent pre-built rig. I looked around at sites such as ibuypower, but I didnt want to spend more than $1500 and I found myself adding too many flashy items to the computer that I wouldnt need. I also wanted something within the next couple days so I started to look at Asus nice I've had one of their laptops now for a couple years and has held up great.<br />Ive been able to run any game in my Steam library at max settings with decent fps, 45+. That includes Skyrim with the graphic enhancing mods, GTAV, and many more. Also played FFXIV with max settings and 60+ fps. If you want to run dual monitors, be warned, the top HDMI and VGA slots are not active. I had to call customer support to figure that out, it was a huge headache trying to figure out why my second monitor wasn't being detected. Thats the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.<br />I would highly recommend disabling windows automatic updates because (as many reviews here have stated) windows and Asus do not get along for some reason. I just downloaded some of the drivers I needed and thats about it...still don't know if I want to upgrade to Windows 10 on here.<br />Overall though, great computer, especially for gaming. It's handled everything I've thrown at it so far with no problems. Oh and the keyboard is pretty neat too."
4.0,love this keyboard and case combino...it is great.  the ONLY thing that I dont like about it is that the keys on the keyboard were starting to wear onto my tablets screen.  that was easy fixed by turning the keyboard upside down when storing the tablet and keyboard together.  Love the way the keyboard is big enough to almost be full size.  Great buy.
4.0,Works very well.  Would be nice if it had a hole in it to make it easier to charge while closed.
4.0,"Arrived on time,in OK condition, worked as advertised, was not new (as explained ) but one wouldn't know it. Perfectly satisfied."
4.0,the mouse and keyboard are working fine
4.0,delivery was fast and product works
4.0,"Very nice cover for the ipad air, great product."
4.0,Very good.
4.0,"Great speakers, I have a pair of them that I take to the beach.. they work exactly as I intended when paired. Nice job logitech!"
4.0,It works well with Windows 10.
4.0,Good basic sleeve
4.0,Great computer but sometimes the cursor gets stuck like right now.
4.0,"pretty good, kind of upset that I can't store apps on the sdcard. Very nice sized. Slow response. I ended up giving it to my 7 year old because his kindle stopped charging. He enjoys it because it plays the games he likes."
4.0,Good product. I keep reaching for the mouse touchpad.
4.0,"I like the microphone.  It is just a simple plug & play microphone.<br />It comes with a tripod stand.  It is a small stand, you might need to prop it on something to make it high enough to comfortably use at a desk.<br />The mic works good for purpose of making videos.  The sound quality is decent.  The sound seemed low, but it was acceptable.<br />I gave 3 stars because there were no instructions whatsoever.  Nothing on the box, except the brand Tonor.  No paperwork included with the product at all.  I understand that it is simple to use, being that it is plug & play, but some type of instructions would have been nice.<br />I would also like to see some type of light on the microphone that tells you it is on, or possibly an on & off switch.<br />Overall, I find this to be useful and a good value for the cost.<br />I would like to disclose that I received this item for a discounted rate for my honest review. I am giving that honest review based on my experience with this product and have not been influenced by the fact that the item was at a discount.<br /><br />*Update, I spoke with customer service and they are going to provide instructions/specs with the product.  I am happy that they took that suggestion.  They are very professional and enjoyable people to deal with.  I would recommend them."
4.0,"Only issue is the blue is darker than what's pictured.  Otherwise, it's a great product."
4.0,"My work computer is a 15&#34; laptop, and if you center it underneath the pad, everything is cooled, no overheating even during heavy processing. On my 17&#34; laptop (I know, it's a bit old), the cooling pad can't get to the back left side. By perspective, I'm talking about when one is working on it, the back left side regarding the computer exhaust and fans. Therefore, I normally move the laptop a bit more towards me and to the right, so that the cooling pad can get to the back left area. It's a bit off center while working, but then the cooling works. Therefore, I'd say it can't truly get to the full surface area underneath a 17&#34; laptop, but I like that it worked off the bat. Oh, if you're into overclocking at all, this certainly doesn't hurt, but it won't get you all of the way there."
4.0,"So far so good, sort of.  First to note, I have had two previous versions of the Satellite with and Icore3 and one with an Icore5.  I have been very pleased with the previous versions of the computer.  My daughter still uses the Icore3 version from over 6 years ago and it works great.<br /><br />This model, although much lighter than previous versions, is a little sharp along the edges and the key board is not quite as nice, but still okay.  I did have one problem with the computer not being able to access the internet on the WiFi after I was on another network.  I couldn't figure out what the issue was so I went to the blogs to figure it out.  Seems the Network Adapter has some issue with Windows 10, possibly.  It got too techie for me, so I just reset my computer to when I received it.  I haven't had the problem since.  Not sure what happened.<br /><br />For the price it has been a very good deal."
4.0,Its a decent product and working perfectly fine
4.0,good
4.0,"I bought this because my kickstand on my other one was bent. I like the color, I like how it's not too bulky. It fits my HDX 8,9 well. It snapped on easily and hasn't budged. The packaging was fine. I was a little worried that it wasn't as sturdy as my other one but has proven to be fine. It even has a little magnet so that the cover sticks when you close it. I love that the stand has two positions, straight up and down and slightly elevated. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because if you barely touch the stand, it will fall. It gets fairly frustrating. However it works well and is a great deal for the price."
4.0,Awesome!!
4.0,Dont like cause it crashes very fast
4.0,No windows 10 drivers!!!! Major drama getting the drivers to work on windows 10 - if you aren't tech savvy it might be difficult and will require troubleshooting regardless. In the end I ran the drivers for windows XP in XP compatibility mode and that kind of worked.<br /><br />Otherwise these are really nice with great sound quality.
4.0,"A little loose for my Microsoft surface, but it gets the job done and it's a really cute color."
4.0,It is thick & heavy but protect well.
4.0,Good stuff... but need better manual
4.0,"Sometimes the hard drive can dislodge inside the case. Using a SSD this is not a problem, just need to adjust the padding to protect against this."
4.0,good for price
4.0,"Perfect for your needs if you don't require much. Holds charge well, great display, ads aren't too invasive."
4.0,Does a great job of protecting my tablet and providing a stand for viewing.
4.0,Good product. I like it 😀
4.0,The keyboard works just fine but I do not like the trackpad feel.
4.0,"A nice looking, yet protective case. I especially like that it wakes up when you open it and sleeps when you close."
4.0,"Works great with the RK3288 Android TV Stick and lets me plug in multiple USB items to it.  However, it did not work with the new Remix Ultratablet.  Not sure if it would work with other Android based tablets or not."
4.0,"Love this mouse works very well! There directions in the packaging are a little misleading and also incorrect. Pairing requires left,right mouse click and holding scroll wheel click down all simultaneously for 20 seconds while you desired devise is in discovery mode. Once I got it paired it's been smooth sailing. Another recommendation is to send it out with 2 AAA batteries. Customers enjoy being able to use their product right out if the box.  These are my reasons for only giving 4 STARS. Overall extremely satisfied with the product itself. Would recommend this device to anyone looking for a budget mouse that works just as week as a Logitech m350 or something similar."
4.0,Like the weight!
4.0,good - miss the spell check and wish it would have had Microsoft Office on it. Other than that - it is great.
4.0,"I love this cover except that I can't fold the cover completely back. If I do, it puts the kindle to sleep. Took my a while to figure that out!! Otherwise, it's beautiful and sturdy!"
4.0,great spare for me to have
4.0,good product
4.0,thought it wouldn't work on my PS2 in america but it did. it fits well and truns it on everything I need it to do. only gave it 4 star beacues its not the exact right size.
4.0,The keyboard cover is to cheap.
4.0,"I've had this mouse since 2013, and just now the middle mouse button is not responding as often as it should.  Everything else works like a charm.  It's been through everything, from click marathons in Diablo 3, ragefests in CS:GO/TF2, to Witcher 3 and then some.  My favorite mouse to this day by far."
4.0,"Not hardly eight gigs each but good enough for what I wanted them for, and good price I would probably buy again"
4.0,I love my new shell for my Macbook! I have the 2015 Macbook 13in w/ Retina. I just bought my laptop a few weeks ago and I was determined to make sure I brought something for protection ASAP! After doing a lot of research and reading/watching a ton of reviews I ordered the Purple case and it looks just as expected. It snapped on super easy and fits tight and snug. The price was great and the look is sooooo cute and stylish! I only give this product four stars at the moment because I just received it and I can not give an honest review on longevity (which I believe is very important). But so far I'm in LOVE!
4.0,Does what its supposed to do
4.0,"For the money, it's really not bad."
4.0,This USB hub works fine the only reason for giving it four stars is because a few times it didn't turn on every component attached but a quick unplug and plug back in fixed the problem.
4.0,"I've had this two years and it's started to make a little noise now and then, but I just lift the laptop a tiny bit and bounce it down. That usually stops it. I'll be buying a new one, and it will be this one."
4.0,great value.
4.0,Really nice case for my surface.
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because being a 48GX user, I miss the equation library."
4.0,Poor quality forever and ever to come.
4.0,Good for gaming. Comfortable. Bad for music listening. The worst peripheral software i've ever seen.
4.0,My daughter loves this and the handle
4.0,It does the intended job
4.0,great
4.0,"Its a great little laptop. I like the size and how thin it is. The speed is  pretty fast on the internet it lags a tad when loading some times but not bad for the 8gbs of ram gets the job done  .The bigger 1TB hard drive is great it holds all my essentials music, pics ,files , etc..  Very easy to use touch pad and keyboard . I like the portability the screen size is perfect and it lays all the way flat like a book I use this feature while I'm cooking new recipes I found on Pintrest .The HDMI hookup is a must have for streaming videos from amazon prime to my Panasonic smart TV . as long as you can deal with no built in DVD or disc drive it doesn't cost much to compromise for a external disc drive . Amazon has great deals on these as well ."
4.0,"Great for wi fi, the antennae arent significantly obtrusive"
4.0,"I like this large size screen, and paired with an Apple Mac Mini and display port cable, I get ultra high resolution.  Images look great."
4.0,not for me
4.0,It works as advertised.
4.0,Nice to have a stylus head that's replaceable instead of having to throw away the entire stylus when the head tears.
4.0,"The mouse is fine as long as it is within 5 feet of the wireless usb. The keyboard however, is a catastrophe.  There is considerable input lag in the keyboard even if it is located close to the wireless usb. Sometimes the keystrokes aren't even recognized. If the keystrokes DO manage to get picked up by the usb receiver, there is also a chance that keystrokes are typed twice from one press of a key. Really annoying.  *UPDATE* September 18, 2015 So Anker customer support emailed me and said they would ship me another mouse and keyboard combo and stated that the first one I previously got was faulty. The new mouse and keyboard they sent me works fine for now. I haven't experienced any aggravating factors such as double inputs on the keyboard. The range is a lot better than the first one I got as well. I don't need to use a usb extension cord anymore in order to stay within 1 foot of the wireless usb. So far I'm happy with it. It is how I would expect a wireless keyboard and mouse to perform. Hopefully the quality of this keyboard won't decline in the near future."
4.0,Works as expected and is made of reasonable materials.
4.0,"I actually didn't buy this dongle on Amazon, I'm just leaving a review of it here because I used Amazon to price match in the store. (I managed to get a $4 discount at the register.)  I bought this as a Wi-Fi adapter for my 2006 Mac Pro so that I wouldn't have to install an Airport card, which is not easy.   Long story short, I went to my nearest brick and mortar stores to find this item. All I found at the first place were various expensive Netgear adapters with no OSX support. Then I left and went next door and found a plethora of other adapters. I came across this particular D-Link AC600 adapter - it happened to be the cheapest, smallest, and had dual band (2.4 and 5 gHz) support built into it.  Even though no Apple support is stated on the box, I decided to research it - I searched online and actually found a software driver for it on D-Link's website supporting OSX (http://www.dlink.com/uk/en/support/product/dwa-171-wireless-ac-dual-band-usb-adapter). I bought it and took it home.  The first night of purchase, I installed the drivers and plugged in the the adapter. A program called &#34;Wireless AC - Network Utility&#34; popped up upon restart and started working to find available signals. The program has a LOT of options and tabs, but is straight forward enough. I found my router name and put in the WPA2 security information - the program will automatically save a profile for the router. After another few moments, I was able to access the internet. However, I had to enter the security information a couple more times after restarting the computer until the program saved it automatically. Since then, the program opens and runs on autopilot upon start up and gets a wireless connection fairly quickly. It will run quietly in the background and doesn't use many resources.  My signal strength fluctuates between 85 - 100%, but the connection is very stable. I normally use my desktop for uploading pictures, streaming HD video and movies, checking email, misc. browsing,and mass downloading (usually GB's at a single time). The D-Link AC600 has given me NO problems so far.  Pros: - Good price - Dual band support - Low profile (small) - Support for old versions of OSX (I'm running 10.6.8) - Has good range and connection stability - USB plug n' play  Cons: - Sticky driver installation and initial set-up  - Not the cheapest dongle  - No obvious Apple or Linux support stated on box; I had to do a thorough search online to find the appropriate drivers   - D-Link has a mixed reputation  I hope this review helps out some people."
4.0,Nice product. Relatively easy to install although the instructions are not intuitive.  Also there it is difficult to tell direction to physically place the screen protector.  The material seems very sturdy although have only had it for 5 days.
4.0,Its was cheap and little and has server its purpose. The image is clear and the cam is plug and play which is what  I wanted.
4.0,Great so for
4.0,Great sound quality and durability. I wish it had MAC OS X support to adjust settings
4.0,It worked great!
4.0,"Just what I was looking for- affordable, protects the Mac, fits well, no issues at all."
4.0,Not much internal storage. not all apps can be moved to SD card
4.0,Worked great. At the beginning one was a bit sticky in opening but it come around.
4.0,"I just got my keyboard protector about 20 minutes ago (a day early, so that was nice!) and I've been playing around with it. Here's what I've found so far.<br /><br />1. The cover fits very snugly. If you try to apply the cover too quickly, there will be a lot of air gaps between the cover and the keys. Apply it slowly and go key by key at first. Then it will fit like it's supposed to.<br />2. It does not affect my typing at all. I personally don't find that it is harder whatsoever to type. It definitely does feel different--the keys feel softer--but it does not feel more difficult.<br />3. The keyboard does make louder sounds as I read in a review before I purchased it. At first I thought that sounded crazy--how could a silicone cover make anything louder? But it does. I find that the smaller keys are just a little bit louder, and it's mostly the space bar and other bigger keys that are noticeably louder. This is just in comparison to typing without a cover, though. Compared to other laptops, the keyboard still isn't very loud at all.<br />4. The coloring on my backslash, enter, and shift keys is not exactly perfect as you can see in the fourth picture I included. The rest of the keys look fine, however.<br />5. The letters on the cover do not exactly line up with the letters on the keyboard. The backlight is not quite as effective this way, but it still lights the keyboard up enough to see in the dark. If you don't even use the backlight, this won't be an issue at all because the letters on the cover are clear and look nice.<br />I included pictures to hopefully give a better idea of the color of the red cover. Also, the pictures I took were right after I threw the cover on, and I hadn't yet wiggled it around to get it to fit all the keys. You can see how much air there is under the keys. If you take time and apply the cover correctly, the cover should not look like that at all.<br /><br />TLDR: Overall, satisfied with this product so far. Types well, I love the color. Four stars just because the letters don't line up exactly and I wish they did.<br /><br />UPDATE: After almost a year of having this keyboard cover, it still fits like a charm, it's still a vibrant red, and I'm still very happy with it.'t line up exactly and I wish they did.  UPDATE: After almost a year of having this keyboard cover, it still fits like a charm, it's still a vibrant red, and I'm still very happy with it."
4.0,I was perfect. Sim card was the perk in buying it.
4.0,"I've had some Targus branded computer components in the past which worked crappy. Therefore I don't believe I will ever make another purchase of that kind from that company. This backpack;however, is excellent! The build quality is wonderful, the layout is perfect, and it is very comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quality luggage option!"
4.0,"Of the mobile keyboards available, this one is much sturdier and the Bluetooth is simple and automatic with exception of first time use of the keyboard. These are qualities not common to Bluetooth devices.  the only complaint would be the folding ability mildly restricts typing on the space bar, but not in any way that limits its use but enough to require a small amount to get used to. All in all it's a great mobile keyboard for the cost."
4.0,Works as described.
4.0,It works as advertised. I always buy Western Digital drives.
4.0,A bit smaller than I thought it would be but is very durable and chic.
4.0,"Great sound, very comfortable to wear, and they seem to be very sturdy. My only complaint is range. While the product description says 40ft, I rarely get more than 12-15ft before the signal starts cutting in and out, more than 20 and it disappears completely."
4.0,Was disappointed it did not have a HMDI connection.  I should read the remarks better.
4.0,"I really like this case, i needed a case that would protect my macbook air incase i ever dropped it and this case snaps on easily and is very secure. At first i thought the keyboard cover  was ripped or messed up but then i realized it was just stuck to itself a little. The letters on the keyboard cover dont quite match the apple keyboard but it is not noticeable unless you light up the keyboard. Also the sound is just the slightest of muffeled when i have the keyboard cover on. Ive had this case for a couple months now and have never dropped it but one day noticed that the corner where it clips on was slightly cracked and over time the crack grew until finally a piece fell off (as shown in picture) and now it doesnt quite fit securely as it did before but still works very good and i still love it and am glad that i got it.<br />(1st pic) back side where it first started cracking<br />(2nd pic) front side where the clip used to hold on to the front side of the computer"
4.0,"Nothing much to say about a sleeve, it fits the Chromebook I bought it for."
4.0,i like it very fast
4.0,works
4.0,"Very nice item. A little smaller than I was expecting, but considering that my first generation Kindle was larger and had the keyboard, it's all good. Very quick and easy sync with my WiFi."
4.0,Product good but for someone who'snever used a screen saver before the iinstructions are very vague and I wasted two of them trying to figure it out
4.0,"Wonderful product that feels quality to the touch and responds well. Truely great batterly life that satifies all of my needs as a student, professionally, and in personal use of my iPad on my leisure time.<br /><br />Drawbacks have been that I have experienced keys coming off on 2 occassions but I have been throughly impressed by the customer service that I have recieved specifically from Anker Direct."
4.0,New to e-readers but overall I like the Paperwhite. Good battery use. Very easy to use plus Amazon automatically updates the unit. Very pleased so far.
4.0,shorter then I thought they would be. So had to get monitor stands
4.0,They are fine
4.0,Still working well after 2 months.
4.0,Works as advertised. Simple and secure antenna adapter that does it's job.
4.0,"Once I got less powerful batteries in the mouse, it worked great. I'd recommend buying cheap batteries (no big brand names). The mouse doesn't work with the more powerful batteries, for example, it didn't even turn on with Duracell. I like that it's small and light enough to pack in my work bag and turns off when it's collapsed."
4.0,Product works well. Nice length to use IPAD when plugged in.
4.0,Worked as expected.
4.0,"This case fits my iPad, which is model MF502LL/A. The iPad just snapped in but it does not come out easily. The design seems clever enough. When I open the case, my iPad wakes up.<br /><br />As long as you insert the iPad correctly there are holes in the correct spots for the button, connectors, and camera. The case has a suede-like feel. I got it in lavender, which appeals to me. This replaces a case that I bought on clearance at a big box store. Both are quite adequate, not identical but functionally similar.<br /><br />We also own an older IPad, an early model, which has a more substantial leatherette case. It is heavier and appears to offer more protection if you should drop the device, but I'm not going to test it.<br /><br />Overall, I like this case."
4.0,"Solid MOBO, VRM's get a little too warm for comfort without added fans on the heat sinks of back of the board when using an FX-8350 chip, but not intolerably hot. Being a premium board, I would have thought Asus would have worked out that detail for the FX series processors by now, but oh well."
4.0,"Great computer! It looks cleaner and nicer than the picture. Very useful features on the keyboard. The only thing i would say it lacks is a good screen resolution. It has a lot of random installed apps, but its an easy fix. Computer works great and its pretty light. A lot of great services in their website. Good performancr for a lower budge computer."
4.0,Nice reading!
4.0,It's good. Just a little bigger than I expected.
4.0,"While this is a very nice case and the keyboard has a great feel, it is inappropriate to state that this is usable on a 10 inch tablet.  The box that the case comes in is a better appraisal of the case stating that it is for a 9 to 9.7 inch tablet.For the LG tablet, the case is about 1/4 inch too narrow and provides no protection for the sides of the tablet.  I might have tolerated the case but it was also defective.  The bluetooth would not connect.  For a smaller tablet, I would say that the case is ideal.  After reporting that the item was defective to Amazon, they contacted the company who immediately sent me an e-mail to make sure I ran through the check list of things to prove that the case was defective.  I told them everything I had tried and they immediately gave me full credit for the item and said to not send it back to them.  That is what I call great customer service and has resulted in my changing the review from 2 to four stars.  As I said, this is a great case if your tablet is a bit smaller than 10 inches or if you don't mind it being flush with the sides.  From their help, I would say that the bluetooth problem is not normal."
4.0,"Item description states &#34;DD-WRT preloaded&#34;.  I ordered it from a reseller, and DD-WRT was not preloaded.  The stock Buffalo firmware was loaded, so I had to install DD-WRT.  That was a chore that took several hours.  However, once it was loaded and setup it worked great.  It may be preloaded if purchased directly from Amazon, but my product was not."
4.0,Works well
4.0,"This kindle works well but the battery goes dead more quickly than you'd expect. Really it is a version of the previous Kindle that weighs less. The internet browser works considerably better than the previous but still has issues loading certain websites. Pop-up ads are a challenge at times. Other than that it is about the same as the older version, a good product that serves its purpose well but I wouldn't rave about it."
4.0,Works better than expected
4.0,"I did not have the same luck as others when simply installing the hard drive and away you go with gaming, XBOX bliss.  My XBOX did recognize the hard drive as a storage device but that was after the XBOX took about 2 or 3 minutes going through the paces on the &#34;splash&#34; screen.  I eventually went through the motions of formatting the hard drive and the XBOX said &#34;unable to format&#34; or something to that effect.  Just by having the hard drive in the XBOX caused it to run as slow as molasses.  Too bad.  This thing would have been great with all that storage but had to settle for the tried and tested external thumb drive 16 GB(which sadly costs about the same).  I watched all the YouTube videos on how to install it and it looks easy because it is easy.  Don't know why it didn't take.  Tried to Google for suggestions and remedies for the symptoms I saw but nothing specific to fix it.  On a positive note the seller has been great through entire return and refund process and I would most certainly do business with them again."
4.0,Bien
4.0,"This is the 4th or 5th Toshiba HDD that I've owned, and I've had very good experiences with them so far. This unit replaces one that went bad from an electro-mechanical fault (hey, that can happen to anyone). I chose it instead of replacing my original Toshiba as this one came with a 2 year warranty for the same price as the 1 year warranty.<br /><br />Out of the box experience was typical of Toshiba's knowledge of how people and machines interact. It can do everything for you, including setting up a very easy backup routine, or leave you free to install the drive into your system using whatever system you use. As I favor a cloning solution, I need the flexibility that a blank hard drive brings; a ten second Quick Format took care of placing my 'solution' onto my new hard drive.<br /><br />Given that the new drive serves as a clone backup, file transfer rates varied all over the place, from 150 Kb/second for copying thousands of very high resolution photographs, to cruising at close to 19 Mb/second for generic text files. Throughout the cloning operation the drive never felt warm, running a pretty constant 37° C compared to the internal HDD @ 42° C. The included USB 3 cord is definitely short, being long enough to reach from the top of the drive over and down the front and into a USB 3 hub stationed next to my Acer Aspire 111-E3 ultraportable.<br /><br />Good flexibility, available software tools & cloud storage, a 2 year warranty (twice the normal coverage), and the lowest price for a 1 TB drive I found on Amazon, equals a good bargain. I took off one star for the very short USB cord and the difficulty of getting into the box (a royal pain, requiring cutting). Overall, a very satisfied customer."
4.0,"Case fit well, nice and much cheaper alternative to Apple case."
4.0,Nice fit priced maybe a little high?
4.0,"Great product - I dont like that it has a large node on the mini end, but i have a feeling its needed for the cord to work properly. Came quick and works great. It was the perfect length to stretch all through my car and was easily hidden."
4.0,great
4.0,"Palmrest area is wearing out after a month of use... Also was a bit difficult to apply since it's very sticky. Blue color wasn't as vibrant in real life compared to the ad, it's more of a blue/gray<br />Other than that very nice product"
4.0,"Superlight sleeve for the Microsoft Surface. Fits both a keyboard and tablet as well as room for a stylus.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Fits easily in a backpack or purse.<br />2. Great color.<br />3. Lightweight material is still sturdier enough to protect the case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. No carry handles so you can't carry it alone without another bag.<br />2. Very specific to this exact tablet, won't fit the Surface 3."
4.0,It's great!
4.0,"Works as described, though it should include a DC 5V power cable (which is not essential to this device's function), or include more detailed specs<br />on what type of plug to buy and recommend a model its compatible with."
4.0,working okey
4.0,"great product, no problems"
4.0,Works well
4.0,9 inch respond when I need it I love it is working good just make sure you shut down the system are you save all your power if you leave it on keep on running it will drain the battery but otherwise no complain
4.0,"I needed to direct light directly over where my laptop docking station sits.  This little device does that nicely. Nothing fancy, it comes on when the computer is powered up."
4.0,worked perfectly
4.0,"don't actually have a &#34;review&#34; yet.  only recently received this item and so far it does what it should, so i am totally satisfied.  i am more than pleased with the price and availability.  so far so good.  my work is backed up and it travels with me and that's what i wanted from this item"
4.0,Fits a little bit loosely on Asus vivotab. Pen that comes with it is actually quite nice. Overall decent case.
4.0,Just what I expected. Works great.
4.0,ok
4.0,"The mouse is quite a bit smaller than the one I am use to, though the curve on the sides could be handy if you have smaller hands. The keys work well and make only a small amount of noise. They are very rounded on the edges though, which has been causing my fingers to slip onto the wrong key at times, when typing very quickly. I will probably get use to this design, but minus one star because the very rounded keys are different from most standard keyboard models."
4.0,"The item works with our camera just fine. I was concerned because the cord in the picture was a different color than the one we needed, but the proper cord was sent to us."
4.0,"Its a little bit bulky and the touch have been a little bit slow since I got it, but its very sturdy and protects the device very well. I'm glad I bought it."
4.0,loved it
4.0,"09-28-15 (UPDATED REVIEW) Their customer service was great!! Once they learned I was unsatisfied with their product, they offered me another case. I chose a black case. I'm not sure why the second case was so different from the first. I found this to be very strange. While the first was clearly a cheap plastic, this second one had a satin feel to it. The feet on the bottom portion of the case were also in place this time, unlike the for the first case I received. Needless to say, I was very impressed by the second case. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the logo was on the top portion of the case. In short, great case the second time around. I would recommend purchasing a standard black case.<br /><br />09-09-15 (Original Review): The case looked and felt very cheap, so I returned it. Unfortunately for me, I had to pay for shipping myself so I was only refunded about $5. I wouldn't recommend this product. Put your money towards something that costs a little more, but looks way better."
4.0,Keyboard is working with my tablet no problem I give it a four star
4.0,So easy to use. Great for using different drives.
4.0,This adapter does do what it is supposed to do.  Lightning took out the onboard ethernet so I replaced it with this wireless.  Would have given it a 5 except that it has dropped out a couple of time for no reason and has to be reset.
4.0,"Works great, but giving 4 stars because the drivers included on the disc do not work at all.  You have to manually install drivers and sort through a bunch of device settings on your computer in order to get it to even detect the receiver.  Of course, I knew I was taking a risk purchasing such an old  accessory, but it will work with some computer knowledge."
4.0,good product
4.0,"Delivery was fast, received as advertised."
4.0,"The mouse is fantastic in all aspects except one. The mouse feels great in the hand, has nice grips on the side, responsive, and looks great. The only downside to me are the side thumb buttons. They are too close to each other and way too sensitive. I find myself accidentally clicking the back button half of the time when all I want to do is grab the mouse."
4.0,Adequate protection but wish it had a hard plastic back cover.
4.0,good product
4.0,A little cheap but for the price it's good enough
4.0,it worked
4.0,Excellent product!..just a little bit big
4.0,I am very happy with this microphone. It is a big improvement over the half dozen cheap mics I had kicking around in drawers. A microphone is not something I would use often. But I have started editing videos and have upgraded my computer to Windows 10 with Cortana. I am using the personal assistant a lot. This condenser microphone seems to be a perfect match with Cortana because it is picking up my voice from 2 to 3 feet away and clearly. Cortana is understanding all the words without errors. The narrations and voice overs I have done are very good quality and background noise is well suppressed.
4.0,Works well. Does not have any more range than others.
4.0,Simple to use. Looks good. Finding an edge to start peeling off can be tricky without long nails. Worth taking time to ensure no bubbles. Overall it does exactly what it says.
4.0,Works fine.
4.0,They work great
4.0,"It's what I wanted and performs perfectly. Everything works great, the menu system is awful. I'd go 5 stars if the menu system were better."
4.0,"I am not a swift person on any type of push button device. But, if my grandchildren can do it...so can I. Needless to say, I do not do a lot with my tablet. But, I can turn it on and off, read a story, and check the weather. Think I am getting the hang of it, only time will tell. I do  notice I carry it with me all the time. Practice, practice, practice is all I need the table great and I enjoy and laugh at how often I goof. Give me and my Dragon tablet time."
4.0,"Works Well, use it often. No problems."
4.0,"Fits great, one of the little feet has already come off. They sent replacements but whatever."
4.0,"Not as bright as I expected, but that was an issue with my assumption I think. It's been a handy tool and a good way for us and our kids to take notes. The kids have also been pretty artistic with their tablets."
4.0,Great Produce!
4.0,Plug it in and it works. Nuff said.
4.0,"Does  what I need. It helps extend cable length to reach my living room.  Connections  are a snug fit.<br />f.y.i. The quality of the connectors are the end of the wires are a concern also.So, inspect the cable you plan to use. Good quality male connector with a flexible narrow latch is also what you want.  If the plastic tab (for spring like latch) is broken you will need some way to retain the cable into this connector.  I have white cables with good quality that connect well with these. I also have a low priced black cable with ends  that are a very snug fit.  The ends  have brittle plastic and a prior crack in the latch portion was how I determined the above need in how to latch the connection.."
4.0,It does what it is supposed to do and the pockets are nice.
4.0,Work very well
4.0,inexpensive replacement that has worked well so far.
4.0,good product
4.0,"I bought this Ez Go Jr handwriting tablet to replace an old defunct wireless model Penpower Presenter Pen. I find it simple to install and ease to use, just a matter of plug and play.  I have it for 2 weeks and happy with it."
4.0,I bought this tablet for use with a downloaded ISailor navigation app that serves as a backup to my chart plotter on my boat. It was an economical approach which also provides opportunity for other boating & weather apps.  It serves the purpose well.
4.0,For the size of sound bar does a good job.  Better then the TV speakers.
4.0,"Nice leather cover, i would recommend this to my fellow e-readers."
4.0,"Cool looking and protects well.  I haven't used the keyboard often, but when I have, it works great via bluetooth."
4.0,"I do like and will order another, but it only holds up so long. This was my 2nd one. Doesn't stay propped up very well, but I can't find another that you can turn horizontal and vertical."
4.0,"i give it a 4 star because you can only use 199GB of the 128GB. they are all like that, not just this one"
4.0,"Will not fit on the larger HTC one, but the smaller  HTC one it works just fine,my husband  did not like it . Our son loves it."
4.0,"This product is great for the initial pc gamer wanting to enter the world of high quality specs. This is great considering the quality parts, but this is priced about $100-$200 dollars more than what it takes to buy these parts and build then yourself. Be aware you are spending a hefty amount on the time someone took to build it instead of you building it yourself."
4.0,It's going to work perfectly for my trip.
4.0,"The keyboard is very nice, however the small screen needs plug power supply and you need to actually know how to use this keyboard. The demo does not really help you understand how the functions work."
4.0,Very good quality aftermarket case for my tablet. ASUS should have released their branded cases with the tablet. Too bad because I bought this one and its amazing.
4.0,Good performance so far!
4.0,"Works fine, doesn't pop off, sleeps Nexus 7 when closed every time, stand position not that useful, doesn't hold well; easy access to volume, power buttons, headphone and and USB jack. Like it."
4.0,The case fit perfectly and it is a beautiful shade of pink. Also came very quickly in the mail. I gave it a 4 because the keyboard cover is a little loose. Other than that it's a great buy for a great price
4.0,Just what I needed
4.0,"This mouse gets the job done. I like that it must go into some sort of &#34;sleep&#34; mode if I forget to turn it off, which is frequent. Saves battery life, which seems to be longer than I expected it to be."
4.0,Product was as advertised.
4.0,"Works as described, plastic snap tool blades break easy but they all do."
4.0,it was ok but it came in a really big envelope wastes trees
4.0,"Fine item, except for some cheesy plastic around the power plug that cracked on mine.  Works well as a hub."
4.0,Serves its purpose.
4.0,"Complicated set up, but it works."
4.0,I received my computer in great condition and have not have a problem with it.
4.0,good product
4.0,"Works great for school, almost perfect, i just need to install some more ram on it."
4.0,So far so good.<br />Good read and write speeds it seems like I got a genuine Samsung ( I've heard a lot of complaints about knockoffs)
4.0,"this is nice, its weighted to prevent it from moving but i found that it still does if you have heavy cords in it, i recommend that you get some command strips to hold it"
4.0,nice<br />work silent around 1200rpm
4.0,"The technical side of the monitor is fine. It works well, everything goes as it should. My main issue is that the monitor does not sit parallel to the desk as cannot be repositioned in an easy way.<br /><br />When using two of these monitors in a dual-display setup, I have to work ridiculously hard to align them properly because of this positioning issue."
4.0,"If you are looking for a fist time starter game machine this is a very good machine, It also it works as your home computer as well. So Far my wife is getting used to it .These CYBERTRON  computers vary in degrees of  speed and accessories. I like this one&#62;7.1 Audio as well."
4.0,No Problems
4.0,Excellent cover.  Good quality.
4.0,"Great idea, but quality control is an issue. I use external drive readers all the time, as I own a small PC repair business. I have owned many external adapters. The flat design made much more sense than the typical upright design, so I bought 3 of these to use in the shop. Out of the box, one failed. No problem, company exchanged it. After a couple of months, 2 of them started having problems. At this point, one works fine, one powers on the drive, but will not read it, one does nothing. So out of 4 of these , one was DOA, 2 did not last 6 months. I like the design, and will look for something manufactured with more care.  Update: Update. Inateck reached out to me and acknowledged the problem.  I received replacement units today. I'll update after using them for a bit"
4.0,This works absolutely fantastic but i do i have one complaint and have not rated it five stars because one issue it does have is it tends to get hot maybe there should be a fan in this unit.
4.0,Decent monitor for the price.
4.0,Great product!
4.0,"The monitor's great, but it keeps freezing up the system.  I'm still working with ViewSonic's tech support on this."
4.0,The only complaint I have about this kindle is that the camera takes &#34;grainy&#34; pictures. After trying everything to fix the problem the pictures are not good.
4.0,"Not much to say here. If you need a solid phone stand that can fit in your pocket, you won't find anything much better than this."
4.0,"Received on time and as described.<br />Lighted tip is always on, even when not connected to Surface and charging."
4.0,Great idea for an adapter. First purchase did not work but the customer service was quick to replace the product with a functioning one and it has been working ever since.
4.0,great
4.0,It's a very good case. Very pleasant to hold. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is that it is much darker in reality than it appears on the pictures. I wanted something of a vivid color so that I can find my kindle easily. This is an elegant dark purple color but not as easy to spot as I hoped it to be.
4.0,"good mousepad for the price (~$2 add on item?), but it has sharp edges- I keep it in my laptop bag as a travel pad, something to run my mouse over when I don't have a level surface"
4.0,I had hope for an easier keyboard for those of us who use excel for statistical data entry
4.0,The only thing that drives me crazy is that the the cursor changes the sizing of the screen too easily. I am constantly having to change back to the default. VERY ANNOYING
4.0,Good stuff!
4.0,I've had it only three days but so far so good
4.0,"Information you may need: customer support==1.800.SEAGATE  (1.800.732.4283) ===The seagate wireless plus IP address: 172.25.1.0 and, website support: [...] ... email address: discsupport@seagate.com (discsupport@seagate.com).  Drive worked just fine...configuring it to work took 2 calls to seagate...1 call for each laptop.  I am running windows 7 64 and Mozilla 39.0. on one laptop, and windows 8 with Bing (or windows 8 RT) and same mozilla on the other laptop. I could not access any of the seagate web pages or sites (I think I have to fix my Mozilla, because I used IE and everything worked fine).  Even when the support websites worked, I had way too much trouble finding anything that helped.  I opened an account and registered my seagate wireless pro, but found out that it was only for sales, not support, so I will now unsubscribe... Both Seagate technicians reached by phone said that this unit should just link without downloading any software, or registering the unit. So according to the techs, I should not have needed to access the website at all.  The only information I needed was as listed above, the IP address and the Customer Support phone.  Once linked the unit is performing as I expected, and is a very good value for the $$.  I gave one less star because it took way to much work to get help when I needed it, however when I got the stateside assistance and a great tech they were supreme, although harder to get to and on hold for a while and transferred a bit. Do not waste any time if you need help call...and keep asking for stateside support until you get it.  So Far So good. Luck to All."
4.0,Seems to want to generate a new IP address for the router out.
4.0,"Going with four stars due to short time owned. Otherwise, it works great! Installed to replace the old battery. Installed, turned on the laptop and saw it was already at 42% charge. Plugged in for a few hours, and charged to 100%. Unplugged the power supply and started a timer. Four hours later, we finally had to plug it back in! We are making sure to run the battery down BEFORE we charge back up fully. This battery was EXACTLY what we needed and best of all it's a HP battery and not a cheap knockoff! May bump it up to five stars if it lasts for a bit before we have any problems."
4.0,"my wife like it,nice"
4.0,"It is a nice tablet. It works good, it is fast. Does everything I want it to do."
4.0,I like my Dell Inspiron laptop.  It has been working well for me.  My only problem is something that is my fault.  I thought that is was a touch screen  & it is not.  I am not sure where I got the idea that it was.  It is still a great computer & I am enjoying it.
4.0,"Works exactly as advertised. I do, however, wish they would have made it REALLY clear what the abilities of this thing are in terms of power and how much load you can put on this thing. If I hook up an external 2TB hard drive I have, it is unable to supply enough power for my xbox 360 wireless dongle. Or, it comes in and out so it is not reliable or stable. BUT, I was sort of wondering if this would even work that way or not. It still allows for me to use at least 1 USB device and have hard wired connection for ethernet with my surface pro 3 (originally only 1 usb port) so I'll be keeping it and using it for that.<br /><br />CON: the device itself was showing exposed wires where the cable meets the hub. It's not lose or anything, just a minor, professional looking con that I have to ding for."
4.0,arrived on time all worked well
4.0,Fits my samsung tab 4 really well. Color and design is beautiful. Very happy with my purchase.
4.0,by now everythink its great
4.0,Works great!
4.0,good product
4.0,Great product. works near perfectly.<br /><br />Some apps don't run correctly or don't install entirely.<br /><br />That's my only issue
4.0,Improved my computer considerably
4.0,It's bigger than I thought but it does the job.
4.0,"Just got it.  The promotional price was very good.  I was worried as my last android device was a real turkey.  My main purpose for this was as a reader .  It downloaded everything fairly fast and with no problems, from my Overdrive app.  I really need it for traveling.  It's a perfect size  The screen resolution if great.  I am not sure of the sound quality yet, but it expect it to be as good as most apple phones.  Amazon really bends over backwards to keep it's prime customers happy.  I really appreciate the good service."
4.0,Perfect fit for my ipad air one. Dont think itll protect so much if it where to fall. And doeant stand as good either. But other then that good fit nice casa
4.0,"fit great,and looks good."
4.0,"I would give this product a 5 star review if it were not for the fact that after about an hour of use it causes my computer to arbitrarily quit/shut down. I took my MacBook Pro (it is an older model 2.2Ghz, circa 2008) to a Mac specialist who ran an intensive diagnostic on my laptop without the USB peripheral and omnidirectional antenna attached and the computer ran clean. Determined that the issue is directly related to the peripheral. Aside from that, it does a wonderful job of amplifying the speed and reception of the wi fi signal originating from a front house router. I am situated in a guesthouse approximately 150 feet from the front house and ordinarily the wi fi signal has to run interference from 5 walls and various metallic tools stored around its broadcast area. If anyone who is tech savvy can give me suggestions on how to overcome this one flaw and avoid being interrupted suddenly while watching a movie over the internet or being online browsing for awhile, I would love to receive them."
4.0,"Going to keep this review short and simple. Upgraded from a AMD 7870 so I could play Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight maxed out, it also made financial sense because I needed a new GPU anyways and I was going to buy both those games so I saved 120 in games and got a new GPU.<br /><br />Pros-<br />- Design,  Great job from Asus here, love the design especially the backplate and fans. The other great thing about the design is how it manages thermals more on that bellow<br />- Performance, This is the best card I have ever used, great frame rates in all the latest games, that whole arkham knight fiasco everyone is crying about, I barely noticed any issues while playing the game maxed with this card.<br />- Thermals, This card is a beast at staying cool, the great thing is when the card is under 60 degrees Celsius the fans stay at 0 RPM meaning this card has great passive cooling! as long as the airflow in your case is good you should have no problem with fan noise from this card, heck even when the fans turn on I cannot hear them over my already quiet case fans.<br /><br />Cons-<br />- Size: This card is long and tall! This was not a problem for me in particular due to my case but if you do plan on getting this card definitely research its dimensions and the dimensions of your case before purchase.<br />- Power LED, Now normally I loved any type of LED indicator on a variety of things put ASUS decided to put a power LED right where the 8-Pin power connector is, the horrid part of this is its a super bright white LED, highly distracting in a case with a side panel window, I had to use a piece of electrical tape to cover it up<br /><br />All in all a great card for anyone looking for a quiet mid-tier gaming card."
4.0,Just what i needed
4.0,"it is good ,but sometimes  just lose network no reason, then i have to reinstall it ."
4.0,"This bag fits my Surface Pro 3 perfectly. I purchased this bag before a business trip and it stood the test. I even had room to carry a USB mouse, Bluetooth stylus, a charging cable and 2 HDMI adapters. This bag does not have room for full letter-sized papers or pads of paper, but a small notebook could fit in the extra pocket. My only complaint is that the carrying straps and handles don't quite match the fabric of the bag, but it is not too terribly off (I bought the grey bag)."
4.0,"I swore I wrote a review already (negative) and came here to update. However, it was either deleted or I have a bad memory (but I remember the review pretty vividly and I was even contacted by the manufacturer.) In any case, when I first got this adapter, I was using it with my Early 2014 MacBook Air running Yosemite to support a second monitor, my first being the Apple Thunderbolt Display. Using the USB port was the only option. It worked well enough to not return but there were two issues. One, there were display distortions I'd describe as a ghosting effect; a gray colored thin bar running parallel to the right edge of any window. I believe this was a known issue as the driver page mentioned &#34;minor&#34; distortions with Macs. Two, there was a several-second lag when using Mission Control, both going into and out of it. It was quite annoying, but Cable Matters sent me a second adapter to verify it wasn't h/w related. Unfortunately, that one had the same issues.<br /><br />I just updated to El Capitan and when I installed the drivers found that there was a newer version: 2.5 (I was running 2.4 on Yosemite.) I'm glad to say that both problems appear to be resolved. I can't confirm which it was: the OS X update, the drivers, or both, but I'm happy with it. There is no lag and no more ghost lines."
4.0,"Should have come with the kindle instead of having to purchase it.  FYI, I saw in a couple of reviews for this product that reviewers complained that it did not work.  I've found that if it is not plugged into a receptacle correctly, then it will not charge.  Much like the charger on the earlier kindle models."
4.0,Pretty good reception all around the house.  Does have interference with baby monitors.
4.0,"My soundcard blew out on my laptop, so I had to get on of these to have my headphones work.  I don't like having all kinds of things flopping off of my laptop, but this is a much cheaper option than sending it in for a repair.  The sound quality is good, virtually no setup involved."
4.0,"If the cord was longer would have been 5 stars. Cords are so hard to find, at a decent price too."
4.0,good stuff
4.0,works well but you will need to install it onto the old frame
4.0,"Nice case, light and does everything the Apple $40 case does for far less."
4.0,It works just fine.
4.0,Punch down tool could use improvement
4.0,Product is so great and light weight. Easy to use and simple to angle in any direction. Love It
4.0,i am a fan; it would get five stars if the material used was slightly higher quality but overall i'd buy this again
4.0,"I purchased the K70 RGB with Cherry Reds at PAX Prime 2015. At the expo I had the opportunity to try Reds, Blues and Browns side by side. Obviously I preferred the Reds. They offer a solid but effortless stroke with just a tiny amount of play and no additional feedback.<br /><br />By far the best feature about this keyboard, and the main reason I bought it, is the the fully flat key bed. Key beds with pockets or indentations collect dust and hair and food particles. We've all seen it, right? When you invert your keyboard, suddenly your desk is showered with keyboard shmung!? This keyboard has no such pockets or indentations, it's fully flat right up to the base of the plungers, so there's almost no where for gunk to get trapped. Such a wonderful feature, you can imagine how easy this keyboard is to keep clean!  And of course the open design looks great too.<br /><br />The palm rest is also quite nice on this board. It has a slightly rubberized surface that isn't spongy but has a little bit of grip to it.<br /><br />Something to note before you buy, this keyboard does require two USB ports. One for data and one for power. Just something to keep in mind in case you're running short on ports.<br /><br />The only real con I can think of is the fact the cable is nondetachable. It's not a deal breaker, but keyboard manufacturers do need to wake up to the fact that, even though we don't often move our keyboards, a detachable cable is extremely useful for cleaning and it makes installing/uninstalling that much easier. So, Corsair, that's my one request... I want a detachable cable on my next $160 keyboard, please! :)"
4.0,"I don't know what or why Other people are having them break and malfunction. Mine works great, charges quickly, and is pretty durable. My only issue is that it fits my tablet a little snugly. So it takes more force to eject it. But otherwise no problem."
4.0,I like the parental control
4.0,"A good replacement cable for the Nook HD+.  The cable is not as nice as the original, so that docks one star, but otherwise it is fine."
4.0,"I bought this to replace my original cable, and it works great, and seems more robust than my original OEM cable. A Good Buy."
4.0,This power supply works great. it is quiet and has all the plugs that i needed
4.0,A bit expensive. Like all things Apple.
4.0,"Works good with Netgear R7000 router, reaches advertised speed.<br />It's not necessarily a micro size because it does sticks out a bit. I think it's necessary for it to stick out a little to get good wireless reception. One draw back is that it does get quite hot to the touch. I just don't touch it and let it be, it continues to work even being really hot."
4.0,"This is my second case. The design is well thought out. Not only does it look good, but it is comfortable and does not hide any of the key functionalities."
4.0,It does a very well job at cooling my computer.  It was just what I needed! The only con is the lights are super bright and shine in every direction. It's an easy fix though - I just put an object in it's path to block the light.
4.0,"Pretty good product comfortable on lap easy to store too ,and very useful for homework specially with the light cup holder I haven't used yet."
4.0,Does the job.
4.0,I would give it 4.5 starts. It is not the easiest to install. Once it is installed it works well
4.0,Works great
4.0,"I got this for my son to use for his last year of high-school.  He loves how light and portable it is. It's not a gaming powerhouse, but he does manage to run some less graphically intensive games on it with no problem."
4.0,"My older son does videography, has a laptop, smart phone and tablet, as well as a camcorder, so I asked him to test the SanDisk Ultra 32GB Ultra Micro SDHC adapter and memory card. He was able to move video files quickly and without any problems. Video quality seemed preserved well from one device to another. The adapter worked just fine. The biggest drawback in his mind was this doesn't come with a case to protect the components, and while that's common, there are some SD cards that are packed within a tiny plastic case for protection."
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,"I thought it would switch between the mail wireless and extension, it does not."
4.0,good product
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,"I bought this stick as a replacement for my aging Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro and it fills the job wonderfully.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Insanely accurate X and Y axes, no physical deadzone on either, yet the stick perfectly centers itself every time.<br />-Grip is comfortable, if a bit large<br />-Can use TARGET software for programming and axis adjustment<br />-Stick does not accidentally twist much at all<br />-Ambidextrous<br /><br />Cons:<br />-All of the buttons are dome switches like on a gamepad, leading them to feel a little cheap.<br />-The trigger has a good deal of looseness to it and the tactile feedback is less than satisfying.<br />-The twist axis is not nearly as accurate as the X and Y, and mine has a small deadzone to it.<br />-The throttle movement is barely one inch, reducing its usefulness.<br />-It has 16 buttons, yet only 4 and the hat switch are on the stick itself.<br />-The LED lit base is very bright and somewhat distracting and there is no way to turn it off short of voiding your warranty and cutting a wire inside the stick.  You do get used to it after a while though.<br />-TARGET software is almost as complicated as it is powerful.<br /><br />And all of those cons are only worth taking one star away.  This is by far the most accurate stick I have ever used, even beating out my old Sidewinder 3D Pro from back when it was brand new.  The fact that it uses hall sensors instead of cheap potentiometers like the Logitech 3D Pro and all of Saitek/MadCatz budget joysticks means this stick should last an extremely long time compared to other sticks in the budget range.<br /><br />If you are looking for a stick, budget or performance, I would highly recommend this."
4.0,It does the work as supposed to
4.0,small and always saving us when needed (Which is every few days when the phone battery die)
4.0,it works.
4.0,nice
4.0,Fast shipment. Just what I needed.
4.0,Good stuff...especially for the price.  Works great!
4.0,"It's very tiny and copying file fast. The only problem is, after connecting to the computer, it get really hot."
4.0,"I hooked up a laptop running Windows 10 to the docking station and it works great.  I used it to get my laptop to work with a dual monitor set-up.  The other USB ports are used for various peripherals for the laptop.  The only thing that would make it better is that if wireless keyboards and mice could work with the docking station.  Fortunately, I have enough USB ports on my laptop to accommodate my mouse and keyboard."
4.0,Works as advertized
4.0,Good inexpensive case. Solid. Looks good. Replaced fans as the included pair were no sufficient for the CPU and MB I installed. No fault of the manufacturer. Included USB ports and media card reader nice feature and work well.
4.0,"Comes as advertised, you get what you pay for, although the construction feels a bit on the flimsy side - so one should handle them with care, the audio quality and comfort is very good, I hardly feel them on. The mic is practical and works great once you get the proper updates from Logitech. I would fully recommend this as an affordable PC surround sound headset."
4.0,Excellent computer for moderate upgrade. Arrived as listed.
4.0,"Finally I have a long cable to charge my phone and have access to it a bit away from the wall outlet. The cable is strong, thick and long. It is a bit heavy in relation with the phone, so I would suggest to handle it carefully to avoid damaging the plug on your phone."
4.0,"Case fits great. Others have said the bottom didn't fit right but so far it fits great. The color is more of an orange color. Take your time putting the case on (no instructions included), I accidentally put the screen cover on upside down and was very hard to remove."
4.0,Great product.
4.0,"Have been using TP-Link for over a year so far... No reboots, reconfiguration or anything since the day I bought it. Provides great coverage through the house. The only minor issue we have is when we use the vacuum cleaner on a neighboring plug in the same room as the remote TP-Link, it knocks off the internet from the remote TP-Link. We can tell because the DVD player that uses the remote TP-Link for wi-fi drops Pandora the very second we start the vacuum cleaner. As soon as we shut the vacuum off, the internet returns and Pandora starts playing again."
4.0,Nice item
4.0,Very good
4.0,Usually people say they break within a day or 2.  (Mine haven't yet!) and its a great part!
4.0,"it's been three months since I've bought it and is still functioning perfectly well; I mainly use it to play games. It feels really light compared to older mice I've used even with all the weights they've provided. Overall it's well made and a good mouse for the price; the only downside is trying to change the lights from pulsing is quite annoying, as sometimes the software the company provided is unresponsive."
4.0,Works great!
4.0,worked very well
4.0,Thank you
4.0,PERFECT gift .......
4.0,Good no problems I'm happy with it
4.0,"Comfortable and nice, yet bulky and collects dust easily"
4.0,works great
4.0,Exactly as shown the item is efficient and roomy for extras you want to carry with your iPad.
4.0,"The cord is a bit short, but it works well."
4.0,Easy to navigate- user friendly. The social feature makes it more than an average ebook reader!
4.0,"Only received it a few days ago and so far, works great. Will update if the battery craps out.<br />The battery was nicely sealed in a static bag, but it smelled a little like fish, despite being totally clean. Dunno what's up with that."
4.0,"Works as advertised, now sharing Cable TV and Internet in same room, with 2 older non wifi enabled computers"
4.0,Good deal
4.0,"Fairly fast MicroSDXC card.<br /><br />Average speeds were Read 19.77 MB/s, Write 19.00 MB/s on my non-UHS-1PC."
4.0,"Good Quality and look, for some reason it weigth more than my other cases and the original smartcase."
4.0,"Plays real good, not as loud as I thought but does the job"
4.0,"I wrote a negative review based on the fact that the product failed just after my return &#34;window&#34; closed on August 15. I had only used the hub for a few days. That was obviously disappointing, but Pluggable support came through and sent me a replacement item that seems to be working well.    I like the functionality of this product and hope the second time is the charm. I bumped my rating to 4 stars from 1 with the expectation that the flawed unit was an exception. Fingers crossed."
4.0,"Smaller than I thought, but I ordered another one since I needed more storage card sleeves. Serves the purpose."
4.0,"I like that it's not bulky and provides a sleek, professional look.  The blue cover looks classy"
4.0,To long of a shipment window.
4.0,"I've ordered two of this monitor. Both of the monitors work perfectly.<br /><br />the only thing I dont like is that the bezel is half an inch into the screen, as well as the frame of the whole monitor. AOC does this a lot though, so its expected."
4.0,"Range of this router is quite good. We have a 1 level 2000 sq. ft. house and the router sits on one far side of the house (roughly 70 feet from the other side of the house) and it reaches everywhere in the house and beyond. The previous router (Trendnet TEW-812DRU) could not reach the carport so I would need to turn off wifi on my phone when setting up for a drive (start navigation, begin streaming audio, etc.). However, 39 days after ordering, it died. We left home and the wifi was on and working. When we got home, the router was completely dead. Lights will not turn on, nothing. I tried another outlet but no dice.<br />Thankfully Amazon extended the return window to 45 days for me and has shipped a replacement (called Saturday morning, arriving Monday). However, going without a wifi network for a weekend sucked and it is frustrating that the product died so fast. I have taken off only one star for the time being but I will update if the issue happens again."
4.0,colors are awesome and even in bright light this is super bright and visible. only thing is a couple of the keys stick
4.0,Love this lap desk. It suits my needs so I use it most of the time.  I just wish the space inside was slightly deeper so I could use it with a tablet protector of some type.  Also I find the latching mechanism to be nearly impossible and need either a table knife or my husband to open it.
4.0,Love it. Works perfectly fine
4.0,easy to hook up
4.0,"Comfy, easy to clean, and stays cool!"
4.0,My grandchildren really like the 3 fires hd 6 i purchased.  My only complaint is the memory and lack of SD slot.  I knew that when I bought the 3 fires.  I purchased Kingston 5 in 1 and loaded movies and music for them.  That seems to solve the problem.
4.0,"I plugged it in to my Widows 7 laptop and it worked fine. I read in 25 old floppies that had picture files without a problem. It is interesting that some of them read in very slowly, and others quickly. I have no idea why, but with this stuff, patience is a virtue. The only problem is there are no instructions for it included, so for a user without skills in managing windows file tree, or knowing how to install hardware there could be a problem."
4.0,Good product
4.0,great it works amazing for a low price headset if you are looking for one that is cheap and really good i recommend this one
4.0,Good
4.0,Very comfortable
4.0,Perfect length
4.0,As advertised
4.0,I'm always looking  for the perfect light ray slim protective cover for my iPad Air –  this cover is light and easy to use - wish it was a little bit lighter but it's better than most.
4.0,"I bought this to replace a different plastic cover which had chipped on the rear corner and would no longer hold my baby iPad securely.  The material in this new one appears to be sturdier.  I'm not sure what the material is, and it may be manufactured leather, but it does not feel like soft natural leather like I have on my large iPad."
4.0,"Birght LCD Screen, Good Construction. Works okay with Rosewill Power Supplies but some other third party ones (Such as Hi-Pro supplies manufactured for dell systems) don't work."
4.0,For the price it is a great deal
4.0,I initially purchased a G930 Wireless headphone which is exactly a G35+Wireless. Didn't like my connections getting dropped frequently due to crowded 2.4 GHz. It's been a good decision to return that product and get a G35. No Battery issues either; and cable length is long enough to move freely around.
4.0,I was a little disappoint that my keyboard will not connect but it will plug into the dock. over all I would recommend it.
4.0,Works great on Jambox
4.0,Great bag set. I get so many compliments. Few people also made a purchase. It's durable. But compact.
4.0,"Good bag, the strap is a bit short but works very well for the intended purpose"
4.0,"This cooling pad has lasted a lot longer than any other cooling pad I've purchased, and it's super quiet."
4.0,I used to have Comcast with 50mbps  I have 30mpbs with CenturyLink I get better wireless signal on my computer downstairs in my basement then I did with the Comcast Modem.  +
4.0,good product
4.0,This inexpensive little microphone works great with &#34;Ok Google&#34; and Windows 10 &#34;Contana&#34;<br /><br />If it keeps working like I expect the 4 stars will be changed to 5.
4.0,Exactly what it says it is. Handy for my phone. Price was good
4.0,Would be great to be aware of the directional nature of the connectors. There is one end which goes to the source! It does not work the other way around. I understand why just wasn't thinking that it would apply to HDMI. Love the length though...this allows flexibility in placement of equipment to each other.
4.0,"Solid build, works as advertise so far."
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received the AC750 as part of the Netgear Friends and Family program at no cost.  I have this Wi-Fi extender paired with a Netgear C6300 cable modem/router.  The cable modem is upstairs in a closet and the wifi extender is downstairs in a central location in our house.  So far the success rate of the Extender has been pretty good.  It has definitely extended the range of my C6300 I have; however I have noticed unreliable connections to the dual-band SSID on my network.  I probably am able to get it to connect about 90% of the time correctly.  The other times I fell back to my AT&T signal in the house on our iPhones.  Installation was straightforward and only took 5 minutes to get it going.  For a quick solution to extended your wifi range, you really can't go wrong with this setup."
4.0,"so far fast and reliable, no problems two months in."
4.0,"Good length, but not very pliable."
4.0,Not as comfortable as I would have liked but I guess I just have a big head:). Still it sounds amazing for the price!!!
4.0,"I do love it but for some reason it keeps freezing on me.  Ever since I received it, it freezes up on me quite a bit to the point where I have to shut it down and then start it again.  When it is actually working properly I love it!  Since that is my only complaint, I give it 4 stars."
4.0,good enough. does the job.
4.0,"I was on vacation in Hawaii when my iPad charger crapped out.  Instead of paying $75 for an apple charger locally, I bought this one.  Feels light, however it gets the job done."
4.0,"soft, and useful"
4.0,NetCam was exactly as advertised and performed as expected
4.0,its good for the money
4.0,good price for good product
4.0,"It worked great, good quality cable"
4.0,works fine.
4.0,awesome. is not a big mouse but still awesome
4.0,So far the tablet has been great! I'm using it for online textbooks and homework! It has treated me well thus far!
4.0,A co-worker wanted this item and loves it.  It puts the keyboard at the perfect angle for her hands.  We may order more for others in the office. It's not real heavy but thick enough to be sturdy.  Should last a long time.  I have a similar item (same thickness) for my calculator and have used it for 20+ years.
4.0,"Hardware? Outstanding! Software? Horrendous!<br /><br />This item is tiny and works extremely well.  It comes with a short cable to connect to your computer.  It's very inexpensive. Perfect.<br /><br />However, I strongly suggest letting Windows (7 in my case) detecting the device the first time you plug it in and see if you can do what you wish to do with generic Microsoft drivers.  I found that the device worked perfectly with that setup.  When I tried installing the included software, I was surprised to find one of those obnoxious &#34;bloatware&#34; monsters giving birth to numerous ad-filled utilities all over my PC! I couldn't wait to uninstall it (them)!  Imagine my annoyance when I found that these programs were of the &#34;self-protecting&#34; type, that hid themselves from my uninstaller.<br /><br />Horrible.  I had to dig them all out and then clean up the mess with CCleaner.<br /><br />Samsung deserves high marks for the hardware but they should be ashamed of themselves for including such terrible software to unsuspecting buyers, IMHO."
4.0,works well and as described
4.0,Better then expected!!! Super fast!! And high quality display
4.0,good
4.0,Fits my iPad3 very well.
4.0,"This is a great first mouse for those with wide hands or slaw grips.  8000 dps is plenty for a gaming mouse.  The software can be a little slow but it is very simple.  The ability to change the sensitivity at the click of a button is great for gaming and photoshopping.  I have tested the vibration damping and it works flawlessly.  The only problem I had with this mouse is some driver or software issues, but they can be easily fixed by reinstalling drivers and software.  Also the support center is great.<br />I recommend this mouse to casual gamers."
4.0,"Good product, works great, and I like the holder for the charging cable underneath."
4.0,Small for little hands. nice!
4.0,Little tedious to adjust every time you want to change height.
4.0,"My standards are low. It provides power, doesn't get too hot. Unfortunately, only two of the four original mount holes lined up. Not terrible though since it was still firmly held in place. Does what it says on the label."
4.0,"Well made, works as advertised."
4.0,"seems to work well. went on smooth, only time will tell"
4.0,good product for the price..
4.0,Works as expected and the price is right.
4.0,Good
4.0,Has really fast data transfer when plugged into a USB 3.0 port
4.0,Must buy
4.0,Works as advertised.
4.0,On the smallish side for size 9 hands
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of touchscreen devices, though this one has its pluses and minuses.<br /><br />On the Positive Side: it's easy to put items into collections - I wish I could drag/drop items, but being able to click check boxes and easily type is a positive. The ability to select different font types and sizes is nice, and you can easily add bookmarks. My kindle just updated within the past few days and added the &#34;Bookerly&#34; font, which is Amazon's font specifically designed for kindle. It's nice, but I prefer Palatino out of the options available, so I stuck with what I already liked. The price is good, and it can hold a LOT of books. The screen is also easy to read, even outside in bright light.<br /><br />On the Negative Side: The touchscreen is really sensitive. If I bump the kindle, all of the sudden my font is huge, and then I have to make it smaller again. Or I'll find myself on another page. I appreciate the ease on turning pages, but constantly having to readjust my font every time my cat decides to bump the kindle, or if I put it facedown on my lap for a moment, is really frustrating. There also isn't a built in light on this model, so you need to get a booklight or make sure that you have adequate light to read with.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good kindle, but I miss my buttons... I just couldn't afford the version of the kindle that actually has buttons now!"
4.0,Looks very good on my mac
4.0,Over a year and still going strong. Wish it didn'y tear a bit. Otherwise it's perfect!
4.0,good
4.0,"Works great, but could be a little smaller."
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,Great value. Thin and fits well.
4.0,works great
4.0,Nice little keyboard cover. Matches my office colors and it's nice to have a little barrier to protect the keyboard from getting really dusty and dirty. Easier to clean this way. :)
4.0,"Great bag, just really small, my charger can't fit inside the bag"
4.0,Nice product I recommend
4.0,Got a call from anker and sorted my issues out.
4.0,this mouse was a huge step up from my 10 year old Logitech mouse....its super fast and sensitive but the setting are customizable through the software it provides you with. you can also change the sensitivity by clicking the 2 buttons below the scroll wheel. if you don't like the green you can always just turn it off. this is probably a standard size mouse its not small but its not huge.. overall its a good mouse
4.0,So far so good
4.0,good price they work fine
4.0,This cable is satisfactory.  The cable is a little thin.  I damaged a good USB cable because it was persuaded into a right angle turn which eventually broke the cable.  I would pay more for a stronger cable.
4.0,"Mostly happy with this laptop. Sometimes the mouse stops working which I discovered is a common problem with this computer. It is a fairly simple fix, but nonetheless annoying. Don't buy this if you want something with a great webcam. The webcam is VERY fuzzy and there are several recommended solutions, but so far I haven't found one that worked.  Other than that, it is pretty quick and does what it is supposed to. The sound on it is very average so this is not going to be a great laptop for the music lover."
4.0,great monitor!!! very nice!
4.0,It is what it is and does what it does: it's a keyboard. Quality's pretty great.
4.0,It works well
4.0,"I do like this bag, everyone said it was great for students, which it is, but its only enough room for a few binders, a book or two, and then your laptop."
4.0,"Works fine, but came unglued because the fit of the cover is so tight."
4.0,A bit of a learning curve to get started but I find I really like it particularly if one does a lot of drag and drop. Seems to have eliminated my RPM wrist pain
4.0,Good product.  Works as well as name brand.
4.0,"Solid gaming mouse for the price, LED light actually looks cool at night, only con would be more customizable buttons will be preferred, but I cant complain for the price."
4.0,"So far, it is very nice & my son loves it."
4.0,I've never had one of these adapters go bad...I'll use these forever!
4.0,good gadget!!
4.0,"No issues with usage since I purchased this. While the body is metallic, the carriage is plastic. Latter's construction isn't as solid as I would like. But as I said, it works. Was willing to pay higher given the USB 3.0 support (but have found that most times there's no noticeable lag issues with using USB 2.0 slots)."
4.0,Very good and useful.
4.0,Very pretty and works well! Do have some scuff marks on it from normal wear and tear but would totally buy again!
4.0,good product
4.0,it will perfect if come with 1 more dust filter at bottom
4.0,"very easy to configure, straight forward options. I am a network administrator so what I find easy, others might not. The two things this unit desperately needs:<br />1) larger holes for antenna access. I had to modify the corners to get better antennas on the unit. The bigger antennas improved performance by about 20%. View image, not pretty but effective. Im sure it voided the warranty but who cares for $35<br />2) mounting options. (there are none). This thing is so small and light the power and network chords move it around with ease.<br /><br />Other thoughts, flash the firmware as soon as you get the unit."
4.0,THE MEMORY ARRIVED IN A REASONABLE TIME AND WORKED AS IT SHOULD.
4.0,This keyfolio is great. It works well and it fits my husbands iPad perfectly.
4.0,"I love it, I just wish I could download books without having internet service like I could with my keyboard Kindle."
4.0,So far I love these. The sound quality is fantastic and the color features are a cool addition. Cord is quite short though.
4.0,Very nice. Easy to put on or take off.
4.0,"The transformation is a little rough, one leg doe not rotate as much as the other, good USB however, cannot beat the value."
4.0,nice
4.0,"Mounting the SSD to the adapter was a piece of cake. My desktop did not directly support the adapter because the chassis used a proprietary sled design. However, the adapter fit into the sled tracks well and sits securely."
4.0,Perfect starter tool kit.
4.0,Works great with the Raspberry PI unit.
4.0,the RAM is installed and performing as expected. It was identical to the sticks already installed. Just expanded to 4 gig. The RAM that was installed before has been operating for 10 years in an office PC.  The new RAM is the same brand and size.
4.0,The mouse looked awesome and well constructed. It did not have LED lights as mentioned so we had to return it.I gave it four stars instead of five because of no lights would have gave it another star had it had them.
4.0,For the price  this tablet does the job. The Antroid OS system is more then sufficient to handle  your daily tasks. The display is good also. I would not agree that the battery last for 7 hours as stated in its write up. But ultimately this tablet is well worth it for the price.
4.0,It is sturdy and serves its purpose.
4.0,Still working great after all the other chargers that I bought at the same time stopped working.<br /><br />Charges fast. Reliable product .
4.0,"all worked, came in on time"
4.0,"It's great!  I wish the delay in highlighting and typing notes weren't there, but otherwise it's great!"
4.0,Worked perfectly. Arrived when stated. Worked on Windows 8.1 and also on Windows 10 when upgraded.
4.0,"As many other users noted, one of the joysticks is guaranteed to start squeaking, even after light use (less than 3 days). I took the controller apart and lubricated it, though, and the squeaking stopped.<br />It's not the most comfortable of controllers to use (my old limited edition TRON controller had ergonomic touches to it), but it gets the job done, and you get used to it. The USB works just fine with laptops, and the installation process is fairly simple, thanks to the disk. I can confirm it works with Skyrim (from Steam). I didn't do any syncing with Steam to use this controller though; I simply plugged it in and played, with no issues."
4.0,Works fine.  But it gets HOT under sustained reads/writes (as in backing up/copying a drive).  No warmer than any other device for routine use though.
4.0,"Good computer.  Not as speedy as I was expecting.  Many problems installing Windows 10, but can't fault the laptop for that.  Just can't figure out why it is so slow."
4.0,Great Design... so modern and clean. Lightweight!
4.0,I bought this to explore some of the KALI2 hacking tools. I would not leverage this as your core home wireless router / WAP.
4.0,"Crucial recommended PC3-12800 for my Toshiba L675D, but it would not boot.  When I investigated further, the manufacturer and a couple of other sites said PC3-8500!  Crucial tech support was no help at all.  He said they guaranteed the recommended memory would work and recommended against using this memory &#34;because it's for a Mac.&#34;<br />Well, I've been working on computers for many years, and I know that computers can be very picky about memory.  I've learned to trust manufacturer specifications.<br />I returned the PC3-12800 and decided to try this set, since the specs matched.  (Thank you Amazon for your excellent return policy!)<br />It works!"
4.0,excellent!
4.0,its nice...
4.0,So far it's worked great.
4.0,"I started purchasing these for our MS Surface Pro 3's (since they only have one USB port).<br />Since these have the ethernet port, I was able to stop purchasing the docking station for most of our employee's saving money.<br />I now have two plugged into the ethernet cable on the work bench and just plug in which ever tablet is brought in to be updated.<br />It works great for the HP 900/1000 G1 tablets as well as the MS Surface Pro's."
4.0,"Great replacement, however I wish it came with a 90 degree plug in so this one doesn't get broken or ruins my computer jack like the factory one had done."
4.0,"Good speed, does what it needs to do without problems. Continuous shots are great with such speedy card."
4.0,good product
4.0,"I like this bag mostly. The airport security feature is definitely a plus and it's quite spacious and has plenty of room for my stuff. The only reason I've deducted a star is because of it's bottle holder. It's good that it has an elastic band to keep it in place, but the zip is pointless (would be nice to have a double zip that locks to hold the bottle in place)."
4.0,"Four stars is generous considering how much trouble I had installing the software or getting this tablet to do anything on the various computers I tried, but I suspect these are short-term growing pains of a new product and my sense is that Wacom makes quality stuff and that most people buying the tablet will be getting a more mature product than the early release I received for review purposes.<br /><br />The installation CD relies on the availability of online driver files which I do not think were online when I first received the tablet.  I have managed to get the tablet to work (at all) on a new Windows 10 Toshiba laptop - I also tried on an older Windows 7 Lenovo, my new Macbook Air, a Mac mini, and an older Macbook (whose OS was too old according to the installation software), and my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop at work (no go).  The CD could not be read by the Mac mini and necessitated a visit to the Genius Bar at my local Apple store to get it ejected (turns out you need a wired keyboard to be sure to eject a stuck CD).  I may have actually successfully installed the drivers on my new Macbook Air but didn't know it (see below).<br /><br />After numerous hard reboots and try try again I finally managed to complete the installation process on a new Windows 10 laptop - suddenly managed to get to the finish without the system hanging, and amazingly, saw that the tablet controls the cursor, but then what?  It turns out that you have to register the product to get a free copy of Corel Painter Essentials 5 in which yes the tablet works.<br /><br />My adult son is pretty psyched about using this tablet when he saw it - he is more familiar with Wacom then I was, and I expect he will get the most use out of the Windows 10 laptop anyway, so I feel pretty good about this - I think a motivated user with some artistic ability will probably get good use out of this.  Like I said, four stars is probably generous based on my experience, but there appears to be a large community of Wacom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential.acom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential."
4.0,Super easy install. Works from the get go.  The only reason I didn't give it a five is because it is a little difficult to adjust one it is in place. That said. You get it in the right spot and it will stay there.
4.0,nice
4.0,"Super cool organizing gadget. The smaller straps are nice and stiff and the rubber tread grips well. The larger straps are definitely only good for larger items as they have more give in the tension. It has no problem holding something as small as an ink pen or as heavy as my iPhone.<br /><br />This one is about as wide and slightly longer than a standard magazine (think Cosmo or Popular Science). The backing is quite solid but it feels as if their are two pieces (or maybe mine just got bent in shipment?) so it has a bit of a curve where it naturally flexes in the middle. Not a big curve, but enough that it doesn't feel as substantially solid as the smaller versions.<br /><br />The pocket is small and won't hold much over a granola bar. Best used for documents maybe? I have a hard time imagining what I might put in there. The little hanging strap is a nice touch, though I can't see when or why I might want to hang it. Still, always nice to have the option!"
4.0,WD has always been my favorite when it comes to hard drives. 1 star less than 5 cause my previous one is getting sluggish after using it for a couple of years.
4.0,Very nice!!!
4.0,"Expected for category (netbook/laptop): 8.1 OS (still can upgrade); no touchscreen; limited disc (solid state); slower than usual laptop. Also, the trackpad requires the thumb strength of Larry Graham doing slapbass to engage the padbased mouse clicks.  So, in general, this category can't get above 3.  For this category: 5 Fantastic value.  Better value than even Chromebooks.     On balance. 4"
4.0,I put this card into an Alienware M17x R3 using a modified bios and tweaked drivers. It works great only thing is the seller didn't include the X-bracket.
4.0,"It is as advertised.  I had the 7&#34; Samsung tablet and now the 10&#34;.  The screen size more than doubled.  I like that.  Otherwise it's the same, just bigger."
4.0,"Great keyboard for the most part.  Instead of giving such a long introduction I'll just right down to it:<br /><br />Things I really like about this keyboard:<br />1) It's got mechanical keys that really make typing easier.  I replaced a different one that was more like a laptop keyboard.<br />2) It's fully wired with a long USB3.0 cord.  This basically makes sure there are no mistypes or battery issues.<br />3) The media buttons are simple and very useful.<br /><br />This I didn't like about the keyboard.<br />1) The biggest problem I had is it has a very rough sharp ridge on the front.  It got painful after a while, however, this was easily fixed by buying a separate wrist restpad. (-1 star)<br />2) It sometimes had a little bit of issues with sliding around my glass desk, not enough to remove a star as it wasn't horrible, but beware or prepare to get something to keep it from sliding.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />This keyboard is loud, like throwing legos down a flight of stairs loud.  Don't use this in a quiet environment.<br /><br />Aside from everything, I have no regrets for this keyboard and don't see myself having to buy a new one anytime soon."
4.0,"I don't know much about CAT this or CAT that, but I have this cable going from a network printer to my Lynksys Wireless Router. We have a few Pcs and laptop connected to the network and are able to use the printer from all but one of those devices.<br /><br />I've used several Belkin products and haven't really been disappointed with any."
4.0,Love my kindle... only down fall is the camera..the pictures it takes are just plain terrible!I love everything reeks about it.
4.0,"laptop is great, but trackpad is not fun."
4.0,"So far so good charger arrived on time, in working and in great condition."
4.0,Not a bad computer for the price. The zoom on this thing goes crazy but I've noticed that most PCs do.
4.0,Be sure your tablet is Bluetooth enabled otherwise there is no usb to connect the keyboard.  The case is nice and strong.
4.0,Seems to have helped with my computer emeory issues. Eazy install.
4.0,"Good case. I think I've had this for about two years now. It is starting to tear but not too much. Once you leave it on for years, it's tricky to figure out how to remove it. From beneath, my tablet looks like new even after years of use."
4.0,Small but cheap. I went overboard installing an Arctic cooler for the CPU. Hardly any room for two hard drives. Works though.
4.0,"I use for my 8-inch AT&T Trek tablet. I wanted protection in my pocketbook, but I didn't want weight. I did cut off the handles, which for my purposes were unnecessary. It's light weight, and I can even stick a small Bluetooth keyboard in the case as well."
4.0,"Sound quality is great, came with an extra set of cloth ear pads which I liked. Comfortable and relatively light. The only reason i do not rate it as a 5 is i don't like the control for volume. Having an adjustment for each speaker is nice but it takes me quite a bit of tinkering to find where i want it and since there are adjustments on both sides i tend to bump them and my sound gets out of whack. All things considered, 4.7/10"
4.0,Clear case not an exact fit.
4.0,It's ok
4.0,"cord is a little short, but works great"
4.0,It oorked
4.0,"I am charging an iphone 5s with an apple adapter and it takes several hours to get a full charge. I am very disappointed in this charger.  Great customer service. They reached out to me and after expressing the issue I had with it not charging right, offered to replace it no problem. I am impressed with the service and feel better about trying another product."
4.0,I like the older version ... The book index was much easier to control.  Very nice new features.
4.0,good product
4.0,Very Stylish and extremely durable/ portable
4.0,Seems to function great. The only thing we have is that occasionally it needs to be power cycled.
4.0,"A very good laptop for the money.  I was debating between this one and the slightly more expensive, larger one with a touch screen and a better processor.  I went with this one because it was more portable and had the SSD.  Sure, I could have easily swapped out the HDD for and SSD, but I honestly didn't want to deal with it.<br /><br />I'm going to be an architecture student, and so far, this laptop has performed admirably with the necessary programs: Sketchup, Revit, CAD.  I'm also a bit of a gamer and this laptop has been able to handle everything save for the most recent games like Witcher III.<br /><br />By biggest gripe is the touch pad.  It feels loose and sticky.  I'm also not a huge fan of the key layout, but I'm just used to the very intuitive Lenovo layout.  Storage is skimpy, but I've heard that there is room for additional storage in the laptop which I may utilize at a later date.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with the purchase."
4.0,"This item was exactly what I was looking for.  It fits very snugly into two empty 5.25 bays and allows you to mount 3-4 hard drives in the space instead.  The mounts are excellent quality, and made of metal and not plastic.  The filter for the fan is also high quality.  There is also an included mount for solid state drives.  My only gripe with this product was the low quality fan that came with it.  It wasn't a huge deal because it can be easily replaced with an adequate fan (I replaced it with a [[ASIN:B007IE5XVM Silent Wings 2 - Geh&auml;usel&uuml;fter - 80 mm]] which I also recommend).  All things said, if you're looking to convert two 5.25in bays to 3.5in hard drive bays, this is a great item to do it."
4.0,Does the job
4.0,"Excellent little disk, but a little expensive."
4.0,Lights up my pc and monitor beautifully. Very bright. The adhesive that comes pre-applied is not the best and will start peeling off on the end where the cable comes from.
4.0,Great product
4.0,"First off, it caused the mousepad to malfunction when connected, then died completely within the week. -amendment:the fantastic and attentive customer service team rectified my issue immediately and satisfactorily."
4.0,Great product for the price
4.0,"Like another reviewer wrote, it is just ok and The track pad is very low quality. Buy a mouse.<br />Otherwise, it's a nice little lightweight computer for the price.<br />I will be exchanging mine though, it has a default in the screen display that makes it look like someone keyed the screen"
4.0,good
4.0,works good.
4.0,"I love the product, but only four stars because the first one I ordered didn't last much more than a year. The plastic on the left hand side underneath the ports broke in half at some point. The laptop didn't have any major drop or anything. Not sure if it was something I did or the case itself just weakened since that piece of the plastic is very very thin. Once it's on your laptop, it's great. Rubber feet are also very good. Doesn't slide on the surface at all."
4.0,It worked perfectly for what we needed.
4.0,It's just a keyboard and it works as expected.
4.0,Works great except you have to tap the screen a couple times before it registers a request
4.0,"Good product, great for powering extra case fans. Great budget item!"
4.0,"As expected, it works well"
4.0,"An update on an already excellent keyboard.  The only gripe I have is the keys are a little stiff, but I'm sure they'll soften up after years of reliable use."
4.0,"Great speeds,  no problems at all so far."
4.0,Did some adjustments to fit my iPad and it works great.
4.0,Works well.  The ASUS has a few glitches in the firmware but otherwise works well.
4.0,"Worked good, happy with this product"
4.0,Pretty and genuine
4.0,"Came super early!!! Awesome. Just try to make sure when you place it on your Samsung, you place it in a lint free area and don't peel it to reapply it because it will make matters worst. I tried to reapply it to get rid of one lint and position it correctly on the tablet and well... it is what it is. The bubbles don't bother me."
4.0,Bought this for my 13&#34; Macbook Air. It fits good but the zipper is a little tight around the top corners when zipped shut. idk if it's just because it's new and needs to be broken in.
4.0,"Really enjoying this system for what i bought it for, Basically email, social media, streaming Netflix to my TV.  I am NOT using it for any real business applications.  It seems lightning fast, simple and easy to use for what I am doing with it.  I did notice that on some TV shows that had a lot of dark clothing and backgrounds that the Black looked a little weird.  A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn't have one going into the purchase so I can't ding it for not having one.  I would absolutely recommend, in fact I already have recommended it to some friends, and bought a second unit for my girlfriend."
4.0,Good!
4.0,I hate you can not get all the apps out there you can even just for android. No disney no genie go for my dish. Great tablet my kids both love them except they can not get certain things like games mom has on her phone that they are not allowed to touch.
4.0,Not extremely impressed but quite a good value for the cost. Touch is a bit sluggish. Wish that Swype was included in the keyboard. But overall a good purchase.
4.0,"This thing is incredible.  A little heavy for long term holding, but the quality of the device is unmistakable.  I really like the newer Remix 1.5 OS (operating system) and I have been able to use it for supplementing my work laptop.  Now my laptop stays in it's docking station and I take the tablet everywhere I need to go."
4.0,"Great price and good for kids. Only complaint is about the charging port. On this model, the charging port is very flimsy and breaks easily, so be very careful when plugging in the charger."
4.0,Showed up in excellent condition
4.0,Works great. Wanted a small form factor for that USB port in the car. Needs a small lanyard to aid in keeping track of it givenmits diminutive size.
4.0,this laptop cooling pad works fine. not to noisy. I gave it 4 stars because I do not like the blue light.
4.0,[[VIDEOID:682c4e951ac761397955cf9c3176d1a6]] I go over the specifications of the keyboard as well as my overall opinion of it.
4.0,This memory card is as described. My only complaint is the time it took to receive it. I was impatient and ran out and bought one for me to start on.
4.0,Good for an inexpensive mouse
4.0,Once I plugged it in to charge the battery for a full day it worked fine.  It's not very accurate though.  The time drifts a few seconds per day.
4.0,"excellent tool. gave it to my daughter ,a nd my grandson said it is terrific."
4.0,/drool amazing with Elite:Dangerous.
4.0,"I do like the keyboard.  It's very comfortable.  The mouse is great.  I enjoy the wireless capabilities on both, it works well for me.  I did expect the keyboard to be quieter.  I have to type extremely slow for it to be &#34;quiet&#34;, and I'm a fast typer.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, I just wish it was truly quiet."
4.0,"I made the move from onboard audio to a discrete card, mostly due to the fact that the audio I was experiencing was sub par.  I had gotten used to onboard audio, as my old audio card died some time back and it was easier just to connect the motherboard audio rather than get a new card.  However, I kept my eye on the industry.  When I finally decided on this card, it was from an informed perspective.<br /><br />The features in this card are more than enough for casual to hard-core gamers, and for low- to mid-range audiophiles.  High-end audiophiles will want the next card up, which comes with a discrete secondary card for additional functions and features.  This card produces excellent sound quality for the price, with crisp highs and deep lows.  Positional audio is also relatively good through headphones, though nothing beats a true 5.1 or 7.1 setup for positioning in gaming.<br />The Controller knob is probably not necessary.  I've got a pair of Sennheiser cans with built-in volume control, so the knob is redundant unless I want to switch between headphones and speakers, but I don't use a speaker setup.  I've also read some reviews of how the volume unit diminishes the quality of the sound as well, as is likely to happen anytime you have to go through more connections, so unless you truly need it ... don't bother.  Just tap right into the back of the card, and leave the controller in the box.  It might make a useful part for mods and customizations.<br />I have no drawbacks to complain about ... this card exceeds my (admittedly not terribly high) expectations, delivers great sound quality, and has worked from the get go.  DO REMEMBER to disable your onboard audio prior to installation, otherwise your software might not natively choose the correct audio output."
4.0,"Most problem-free card-reader I have ever used. Works plug-and-play on all my platforms, even with oddly-formatted SD stuff being plugged into it.<br />So, why'd I dock the star? It only reads from SD or microSD at once. Which means that if you want SD to work, nothing gets to be plugged into the microSD slot, and vice versa. But I can't complain much: it's trouble-free otherwise."
4.0,"It ended up being thinner than I expected, but I love the design and it works just the same."
4.0,"First experience with a Kindle, better than I thought."
4.0,"This is, as the name suggests, a Basic no-frills four port USB 2.0 HUB, at a very good price. It is well constructed, and functions well. It lacks a separate power source, which may affect your charging time for phones, tablets etc. depending on your computer, but for additional ports for keyboards mice etc., it's fine. It has a single &#34;on&#34; light when plugged in to the vomputer, but not individual lights  for each device you plug in. It comes with a permanently attached cable with a standard USB plug to plug in to a port on the computer, and four (4) ports for plugging addition devices into the hub. The whole thing seems solidly built, the cable is firmly attached, and the ports feel snug and not loose for avery thing I plugged into it.<br /><br />Pros: Well built, does it's job, and is affordable.<br /><br />Cons: There is no external power supply, so that might be an issue for some uses, like charging phones etc.  But also means you don't have to find somewhere to plug in another popwer brick, There is only one power light, so no indicators for separate devices being plugged in. And finally, the permanently attached USB cable is short, and you can't replace it if damaged. You'll have to buy an extension cord if you need a longer one. On the other  hand, you can't misplace the cable either.<br /><br />A basic (as the name suggests) but good solid affordable product."
4.0,Work fine
4.0,"This is a decent laptop fan. The build quality is basically feels really flimsy and not all that great, but it looks cool and I like the blue LED accent. There's 2 rotary dials in the back, one for the top two fans, and the other for the bottom two. However, if either dial is cranked all the way, all 4 fans will turn on and light up. I prefer to run fans like this at full power, so I don't mind the wonky power dials. The fans are powered by a full sized USB cable, which is included. Bonus - there's a USB port on the back so I don't lose a port just because of these fans. They function quietly and give decent air flow. There's two feet that angle the fans and my laptop, but the angle feels far too extreme to be of use to me. I think the price is a touch too high for what it is. I was given this free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,good product
4.0,It fits the bill.
4.0,"Does what it should do. Packs a lot of features and reasonable screen quality in a very attractive price. Not very fast but hey, what do you expect for 40 bucks."
4.0,Good for my old MBP15&#34; but not with the Case.
4.0,Package arrived quickly. Heatsinks were easy to install. Great product.
4.0,my daugther is so happy with her neuTab!!!
4.0,Its ok. Works fine but its ripping in the usually place near micro usb port. You get what you pay for but it still works so no complaints. Going on several months now and I do not have any problem with any of them that I bought (bought several) on how its functioning.
4.0,"Good Bags, the screen cleaner is unnecessary and just adds to the cost."
4.0,really a wonderful monitor.  great color resolution and easy to adjust as well as turn on and off.  highly recommended.
4.0,Product seems to be working properly.. the only bad part was the delivery time. :S
4.0,Very pleased with this product.
4.0,"A necessary feature that I really miss is backlight on keyboard side (4 stars coz of that),  usually a dark room and different keyboard layout are not a good combination. I have to have some light in order to use it for typing.<br /><br />+ Air mouse function works great tho.<br /><br />- Another thing that I notice is that if you are using the Air Mouse mode and KODI on an android box, the center &#34;OK&#34; button won't work sometimes, having to disable it and use arrow keys instead."
4.0,good
4.0,"Purchased this tablet as a gift and works as advertised. For the price, it has many useful features. Very happy to have purchased this as a gift."
4.0,"Fits macbook 13&#34; nicely. Have to get used to the grip surface as typing is not as easy. Also, keep in my the piece muffles the speaker as most of the sound comes out of the spaces in the keyboard. However, the protection is the most important part, so it's a very good product."
4.0,"It definitely fit my laptop, an HP Pavilion g7 2220us, and was pretty easy to install. I just followed a video on youtube and it took about 20-30 minutes. However, I noticed that this screen was not as glossy as the OEM and that the colors were not as bright and vivid. It sort of looks like a hybrid half glossy, half matte, if that's even a thing. Either way, it was worth the money I saved. I don't know what the OEM cost of the screen is but this one is on par with other replacement screens I've seen online."
4.0,I purchased this product for a discounted price in order to give an honest review.  I have a 2015 Macbook Pro and it works with it.  It easily connects ethernet cables to my usb port!  My Macbook doesn't have an ethernet port so this product is very handy!  I definitely recommend it.
4.0,Good deal. Had to push a little on the patch ends to make connectivity but besides that they work just fine.
4.0,Bought for portable DVD player for outside use. So-So Sound. Just watched a movie in Hotel Room and wow like a different speaker. Suprisingly Crisp clear acoustics. Had to lower a bit as to not disturb the neighbors. 50 Shades of Yay.
4.0,"Nice sticker, but the price is a little bit too high."
4.0,Fit well no complaints.
4.0,Little hard to put together but works great
4.0,"Works as advertised, but don't get this type of device if you're hoping to capture signatures."
4.0,nice inexpensive functional part.
4.0,Good
4.0,"Works well, is about the size of your hand, if not smaller. Works well but I wouldn't use it to play games."
4.0,Extremely easy to install on top of my flat screen monitor.  SW install was automatic and fast (I have Windows 7).  When I launched Skype - it automatically found the camera/mic unit and helped me do a simple set up (volume and image check).  Ready to go in about 15 min total.
4.0,its very big for my spigen case so i had to shave some of the plastic
4.0,arrived as described
4.0,Excellent read speeds -- 90.11MB/s Seq but not so good write speeds 17.38 MB/s - benched with Crystaldiskmark in a USB3.0 adapter which does a fair assessment of SD and microsd card speeds...<br /><br />What this means is I would not slap this in a Hero 4 and roll the dice as the write speeds are too slow for that.  Still not bad for my Galaxy S5 or Note 4.  Will need to pick up faster 64GB cards for the Hero 4 cam though.<br /><br />Would have been more impressed with 80MB/s read and 30MB/s write but still an OK card.
4.0,Easy to install
4.0,great price
4.0,Great PC for a starter.  Very satisfied with the shipping and simplicity of startup!  You may want to upgrade the graphics card to the most out of current games as the 6670 does not get you too far past med on most games.
4.0,My son said they are good. Not even close to his turtle beach set but well worth the money. Very pleased.
4.0,Did the job!
4.0,This DVI to DVI cord was what I needed. Replaced my old cord that has had a lot of use. The High Resolution and Gold Plated was an added benefit.Works as intended with no flaws.
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,"Not a really great laptop but it is what I expected from the specs. I had to disable the tap-to-click function on the track pad because I couldn't adjust to it, or it to me. That leaves &#34;press fairly hard in a corner&#34; as the only way to click, which is not great. Windows 10 installed a few days after I purchased it and seems to be the antidote to Windows 8, which was annoying for those few days I had it. It's light and it has a very decent battery. I took it to a coffee house and it worked well there.  The screen is a little narrow-angle for a laptop. The degree of it is that if you are looking at say, a cat picture from reddit, the detail will go away if you don't look straight at the screen and it might not appear as fluffy as it should. In the same conditions or worse, an iPad will still be clear. You will be able to read text if the designer provides decent contrast, though. On a desktop computer, or the sort of large laptop that you sort of really settle in with, this is not a problem because you'll establish a comfy position in your seat and optimize everything and leave it that way. On this type of computer you will tend not to optimize everything. When you're looking at a picture critically, you'll have to fuss with the orientation of the screen and maybe get out of that comfy slouchy position you're in.   A little off topic but after I got Win10 I tried the new Edge browser. You will find (late summer 2015) that lots of websites don't like Edge or can't figure out which browser it is. So I installed Chrome, which is an ironic outcome if you think about it."
4.0,works great.
4.0,Works great for power and data. Only issues is that they are not as sturdy as I would have expected and one broke quickly.
4.0,It is attractive and lightweight but shows wear after some use.
4.0,It works some what.  I do not like that I needed to connected each drive when needed.  I prefer the original iOmega
4.0,"Works great, as expected. Not the fastest connection but that could be due to my service/computer."
4.0,very nice but breaks easely
4.0,"Love the bag. Exactly as described. Perfect format, looks good.<br />The only small little down side is the fabric underneath the shoulder straps is rough on the skin if you are wearing tank tops."
4.0,"Like, this item."
4.0,It's a jump drive and does what it should do.
4.0,"Works as advertised - solid product, great price."
4.0,"Just a little bit hard to get it on with no bubbles. but Overall , it works fine."
4.0,Good enough for the price!!!
4.0,"Good hard drive case, especially for the price. Recommended."
4.0,I have just installed the new bat on my Sony Vaio and it looks perfect. The insert was good and sharp and the battery is runing OK.<br />I can't tell how much time my computer can run on the battery because this is the first time I'm trying it.
4.0,"Great item, though it costs more than the devices it is charging/protecting.  Don't know that I would buy again due to this.  I guess if I were housing iPads in there it would be worth it. but for &#60;$100 Android devices the cost just isn't worth it.  It is almost cheaper to just replace the missing/stolen devices."
4.0,Love the look and feel of this case.  Very slim profile.  Maybe it's just new and stiff but the standing feature is a challenge for me to get positioned correctly.
4.0,"Seems just fine to me.  I don't know that this battery last any longer than my old one, but I'm guessing that my old one wasn't in as bad a shape as I thought.  Probably just the Airbook I'm using and the amount of processing I'm doing.<br /><br />The little screwdriver that came with it stripped after the first screw was removed.  Not well made so I had to order another one online.  That was irritating.  But the battery seems fine."
4.0,"Speakers be bumpin, yo. Make sure that sub is clear of debris, and take good care of your equipment."
4.0,Old tech but needed for and old system.
4.0,Great item.
4.0,Very nice laptop! I also installed Antergos Linux (guidelines: http://itsfoss.com/dual-boot-antergos-windows-uefi/) on it with UEFI enabled (dual boot with Windows).
4.0,good product
4.0,like it
4.0,Great item.  Would have been 5 stars but for a slightly shorter cord.
4.0,This cable has worked great.
4.0,"I bought my last Anker about 18 months ago.... it performed well just about through the warranty period.  No complaints.  It's very difficult to keep a battery healthy, in my opinion, because even after you've conditioned the battery, it's not very good IN MY EXPERIENCE to keep a charge going to the battery after it is fully charged.  I keep my laptop in the same spot, so it's easy to forget to unplug the charger and let the battery actually do the work.  So long as you properly condition the battery per Anker's recommendations, you'll get very good performance.  And if you let the battery do what a battery does (ie, not keep it plugged in all the time), I think it will last a whole lot longer than 18 months."
4.0,Don't expect Minecraft to run well on this laptop unless you use the integrated GPU.
4.0,I ordered two one me and one for me daughter.  We both are very pleased.  The only complaint we both have is the speaker is on the back of device instead of the front so when you stream movies it makes it more difficult to hear.
4.0,Fits like a glove.  Feels good in the hand and the auto off/on function by opening the cover is a plus.  I really like it.
4.0,Fits hd7 perfectly
4.0,I have a few of this HDD nice performance keep in is only 5400 rpm not 7200 or even 10K
4.0,simple plug and play. works fine
4.0,Great product at a fair price
4.0,good product
4.0,works good.

4.0,"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop away from home, so I was looking for something portable, sturdy and reliable (but really when aren't you looking for these qualities in things...) but at a low price.  So I looked and considered several different mice, including this one. Honestly I really wanted the Apple Magic Mouse, but did not want to pay that much since I wasn't going to use it very often.  That's when I came across this one, which I saw had decent reviews, Bluetooth, and most importantly was decently priced thanks to Amazon's Warehouse Deals.  When I got the mouse I was a little surprised at just how short it is, it very thin compared to say a standard mouse you'd see bundled with a desktop, but not small like a travel mouse (not sure how to really express that in a different way).  One feature that is mentioned with this mouse is the blue-track laser.  Now I can't give you specifics compared to a standard red laser, but I've used this mouse on all kinds of surfaces without a mouse pad over the past few weeks, and have not experienced any problems.  The reasons for me this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it feels a bit more &#34;plastic&#34; than I'd prefer and the mouse buttons are a little sensitive for my taste.  The mouse has a nice rubberized feel, and is very light, but just feels like thin plastic when you hold it, almost like it flexes a little in spots,  For the buttons (left and right, not the mousewheel which can act as a button as well), since it is so thin, there is not much travel on the button so it is more sensitive than I would like, just personal preference.<br /><br />So all in all I like this mouse and would definitely recommend it with those caveats that if you're not expecting something super sturdy, and don't mind sensitive buttons then go for it!"
4.0,Very good works very good
4.0,"GREAT cheap little PC! For a, just over $100, all in one PC I have to say that I am impressed.  Don't get me wrong, its not awesome, but this little guy has far exceeded my expectations for what I payed.  I set mine up as a media center PC,  it was quite simple and it has been performing well. 1080p movies play flawlessly, and the systems seems snappy and quick in general. I am not much of a gamer these days, but the older games I installed played just as well as on my desktop. I only give it 4 stars because the audio could be better.  Actually the sound quality is fine, but when sound starts and ends(like when you play a movie), you hear a little click as the audio device kicks in/out.  A little annoying, but certainly not a deal breaker! Don't listen to the reviews who say  the storage is only half of the ad... its only because it has a dual boot with Android 4.4, which you can delete."
4.0,Great case for a Raspberry Pi or Pi2. Well made and fits together nicely.
4.0,"This has been working well for me so far. A little slow at times, but fine for the price. It has served all of my needs-basic web surfing, word processing, Netflix, and a few games."
4.0,Great item. Definitely provides protection for my tab.
4.0,"This is an excellent masculine looking bag.  It holds my iPad Air, two smart phones and miscellaneous small items.  I'm happy I have it. Drawbacks: shoulder strap is a bit chinsey with no padding.  It would be nice to have a pouch on the side capable of holding a small umbrella."
4.0,"I've used this model of intuos tablet for about 4 years now, and it has served me well. It is the smallest size, but because I take it with me when I go on trips, it is perfect for my needs. The command keys always work perfectly and it recognizes my pen pressure very well. My only complaint is that if you're like me and take it with you, be careful of how you fold up the wires. The wires can become loose and refuse to work anymore (only an issue if you don't have it in one designated area all the time, so those of you who would have it at a desk or only move it once in a while should not experience this issue). This is my 3rd Intuos 3 since I started using them because of this issue. Luckily I'm very fortunate to never have had any problems with the pen, so I'm able to find sellers like this one who sell them inexpensively for the tablet and software only. For anyone who may be wary of the low cost and think there must me something wrong with them, I can assure there is not. I received mine today and have been drawing with it almost constantly since then. It works perfectly and because I already had the software installed, it remembered my keystrokes. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone who may be looking their first tablet as it is extremely easy to learn the maneuvers and customize to fit your art needs."
4.0,"The appeal for the purchase of this unit was for its COMPACT size, making it extremely easy to fit anywhere and carry around.<br />Also the fact that its so small it won't invade nearby usb ports in a desktop or laptop which some thicker usb drives tend to do.<br /><br />The speeds are not up to par with similar or cheaper priced drives that supposedly offer same speeds.<br />The speeds this drive has using usb 2.0 are as follows:<br />7.8 mbs Write and 31.5 mbs write<br />Using it via usb 2.0 wouldn't classify it as ''class 10'' if comparing to sd cards  its mediocre at best and its 3.0 writing speeds are not amazing either.<br /><br />Using usb 3.0 speeds are as follows:<br />Write: 14.8 mbs  Read: 74.7<br /><br />So as you can see using usb 3.0 double if not more in speed.<br />The read speeds via usb 3.0 are actually great however the write speeds via usb 2.0 or usb 3.0 are just mediocre at best.<br /><br />If you need an ''ok'' write speed small little drive this is definitely a good buy. However if you need something faster to write files you should probably buy something else. Id imagine most people would not be constatnly writing files to this drive so its usage and size is a value buy.<br /><br />I actually wanted to try the 64 gb  ( 3.0) version but it seems its never in stock. If silicon power ever releases a larger storage usb 3.0 and faster write speeds then its definitely an instant buy for me."
4.0,Heats up. But works perfect for the price
4.0,"This case is so beautiful and the shipping was really fast. Reason for four stars is because the case is peeling only a few days into having it. Which is something I was expecting but was hoping wouldn't happen, but it's beauty makes up for it I guess."
4.0,Works great.  I'd recommend it.  Easy to install.  No issues using it for about 2 months.
4.0,is ok
4.0,"I liked it a lot, but the cables are SO SHORT.  Keep this in mind they are not of standard length and will get on your nerves."
4.0,"Works well. Lighting on keys is good. I prefer a flat keyboard so it's a bit tough for me to type on, but for gaming it works quite well."
4.0,As advertised. Does the job.
4.0,cabel worked great. thank you
4.0,"Just put it in, laptop still kinda slow but I'll give it some time and see"
4.0,Plenty long. Great for laying in bed and charging. Was difficult to plug in at first. Especially when there's a case on the phone.
4.0,"i am using now,  not problem"
4.0,good !
4.0,Very lightweight unit which is a good thing. So far it has met my expectations and performs the tasks I need pretty well.
4.0,Works fine! The only thing i had to do was buy a $28 part to make it wireless. So far i am very pleased!
4.0,"Using it in my case, good color, but not too bright. Still would recommend depending on how you set it up."
4.0,nice
4.0,yup
4.0,Works as stated. Pretty easy to set up. Have to restart it from time to time but that's normal with almost any wireless device. It hasn't blown me away with performance but it's reliable and has a constant signal which is nice because before the reception was all over the place. Definitely worth the low price point.
4.0,"Arrived safely and well packaged. Looks exactly like the original and was easy to install. Could have more adhesive on the back side, wasn't that sticky but its holding up fine so not a big deal. Waaaaaayyyy cheaper then having Apple fix it!"
4.0,Works as advertised
4.0,"So far, good, only a couple of weeks installed, we will wait to see how the batteries last throughout the year.  The biggest benefit to these batteries is they all fit easily into the required slots-not so with all replacement batteries."
4.0,"Got it early too, hardware works great, I'm happy."
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,"They tried their best to fix it remotely, but could not.  I can't find a battery for it online either."
4.0,Does the job
4.0,The item's exactly as described... maybe a little better. The leather is excellent and the size is perfect. Thanks!
4.0,all good!
4.0,"Great coverage,  feels nice."
4.0,"I really love the practical use of these hooks for cable management, they open up a variety of ways to rout wires, the only issue i have been able to find with them is that the adhesive covering on the back can be a bit of a pain to get off, i recommend taking a pair of tweezers to it to help take it off.<br />Other than that i recumbent getting all that you need and maybe a few more because its easy to find uses for this around the home."
4.0,"Nice, except it take getting used to the separate number keypad."
4.0,"Working great so far. Haven't experience any connection drop so far.  Easy setup, and matches my maximum connection speed."
4.0,"Might be suffering from early build quality issues. First one I picked up from Bestbuy had a dead pixel, returned that. Second I picked up had lighting issues at the bottom, they were uneven and really dark in some places, returned that. Third one I got, had a dead pixel, returned that. Fourth one I have now still has a dead pixel, but not going to keep trying.<br /><br />Other than that, the device is fantastic. Great for reading outside, looks just like you are looking at any normal book. Reading inside is also pleasant with the use of the adjustable backlight. Device is very light, even with the official Kindle leather case on it. One thing I can't stand, and I wish manufacturers would stop doing, is the material. It is a fingerprint magnet. While I am glad it is not a glossy finish, the flat matte finish is not too much better.<br /><br />It is not as bad since I have it in the case, but for us OCD people, it is a little annoying getting all dirty like that. Battery lasted for over a month with WIFI on, and still had some left, was not forced to charge, just chose to do so. UI is a little sluggish, but for what this device is that can be expected. Overall I am really happy with the device, would recommend to anyone looking to get into the e-ink game."
4.0,Love it
4.0,I like it but once you add a thin protection case on your macbook then the sleeve is extremely tight
4.0,"Great cables. Wish I could have bought only the one I needed, but they are reasonably priced."
4.0,"Fit of battery and performance is good.  Other replacement batteries I have purchased have not fit properly and would not charge.  When working at a desk, the oversized battery raises the back of the laptop to a nice angle for typing.  I assume that this also helps with ventilation.  However, on an HP DM-4, the oversized battery limits how far back the screen can rotate.  When working at a desk this is not a problem.  However, when working with the computer in my lap, the screen will not rotate as far back as I would like."
4.0,"Perfect for what it is, and the price. Performs better than I expected."
4.0,"great, love it!"
4.0,Works like a charm. Looks good. Very compact. Longevity unknown.
4.0,Good cover like it a lot
4.0,"A great vertical mouse for the money.  Having to click a button to wake it up is slightly annoying, but you get used to it.  It could be better if the scroll wheel was smooth and had weight like logitech."
4.0,good memory
4.0,Color is exactly like what you see online.
4.0,Nice compueter. Well designed and fast enough.
4.0,good product
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,okay
4.0,This battery works great - it really lasts and lasts! My only complaint is that it is big - it props up the back of the laptop which puts the keyboard at a weird angle. I have to prop the front of the keyboard about an inch to make it usable. But overall I'm happy with it.
4.0,It fit correctly and did not interfere with my MacBook Pro's touch pad buttons.  I followed the initial charging instructions and the battery has been performing very well so far for two months.  I'm reserving the fifth star to see how long it lasts.
4.0,It's a great looking stand
4.0,thank you very much! so much better than other brands. Works as good as original !
4.0,Above and beyond my expections!
4.0,Works as described. I was looking for something to reduce the glare on the Mac's screen. This product does the trick.
4.0,Nice
4.0,Love the length. however sometimes once it fully charges my iPhone 6 it will pop up a notification saying that the device is incompatible which isn't too big of a deal.  ---UPDATE-- The cables all basically stopped working after a couple months use unless you manipulate the cable to a certain position and it's a real pain. I wouldn't recommend.
4.0,"Ports are buggy sometimes, but either than that it's pretty good overall."
4.0,"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've had to write. I am so torn about whether I really like this laptop, or not. I've been using this Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 for two weeks. Performance wise, I have had very few issues with it. When I first started using the laptop, it would freeze up, and I would have to reboot. Fortunately, that issue appears  to have corrected itself, and is now operating perfectly.<br />The laptop is speedy, but as you would expect for the money, it is a basic model. My real complaints are with the keyboard, and housing. I've never had a laptop that came in a plastic housing; it's like playing with a Fisher Price toy. The keyboard is very soft, and the track pad is challenging. It's really hard to believe that this laptop will last for any length of time. But to be fair, considering the price point on this laptop, it has a lot going for it, and I have not seen anything that can equal it. So if your interested in a good, low cost, workhorse, this computer might fit the bill."
4.0,I have to take my ipad out of the case quite frequently and it is a little difficult but other wise I am very pleased with it
4.0,"I like everything about it except the Windows * OS.  One thing I really dislike about it is it will not allow the use of any apps except MS apps because of the OS, very frustrating because of the limited choices and the fact that I have ones I already use and like and there are not equivalent ones to use.  The MS suite was also a temporary 1-month trial."
4.0,This has been a really solid MythTV frontend. Streams 720P very well over 150Mb/s WIFI. I had to get my own CPU cooler fans.
4.0,Returned with no issues. No problems with memory. Person gave me wrong information as these were wrong type.
4.0,Good item
4.0,"It would have been a 5 star rating, but the lack of online support and no web site with &#34;howto's&#34; and no response from alleged tech support made it a 4 star. Return first card and the second one work with some assistance from the web community (HighPointRocket should have had that info in its web site). The card is good  but their support is NIL."
4.0,"very powerful graphic card, a big step after using GTX 660 ti for 2 years, but still not the best"
4.0,Works just fine in my tablet
4.0,received on time. Have issues with in bound VPN. Not forwarding traffic to downstream network Sonicwall routers
4.0,"Runs everything I throw at it. Witcher 3, arma 3....all the heavy hitters run with this. all though sometimes I have squares that form on my tv where its looks all pixilated and distorted. If the card craps out Ill not be a happy customer....since I only got it a few months ago. But running ok other wise."
4.0,"Works, but only from a command prompt.  Windows Explorer doesn't recognize it.  No worries:  command prompt is a sufficient workaround for someone familiar with it."
4.0,Am hoping this works well. It was difficult to install and if I had not had a computer I would not of been able to do it at all . With NO instructions included to read and follow . Other than that I am fine with it and it came in a quick manner. Thanks
4.0,The kids love these...only complaint is they are used to the speed/smooth operation of our iPads.  The Fires are a little slow to respond to touch and sometimes loading apps takes a really long time.
4.0,Worked out great. My granddaughter loves it.
4.0,"First battery that was shipped would not hold a charge. After contacting the seller, they shipped another one out next day and this one seems to be good."
4.0,"ore applications.Some Apps I use often, most notably Harmony Remote, not available for Fire OS.  Good value if you just need Amazon Apps."
4.0,Went on vacation and left my charger at a hotel. Thankfully I was able to find another at a half way decent price. Works as intended. Thanks for the fast shipping
4.0,Good cover but shows dirt/ dust marks easily
4.0,i keep locking it when i try to hit backspace but i end up hitting lock so have to wake up screen again ... i would have put the off and the backspace buttons reversed. otherwise it works well
4.0,Didn't try that much but overall the speed better than my old class 10 SD Card
4.0,Good
4.0,Great audio and awesome padding but it hurts your ears after a long while of using it.
4.0,"At the risk of stating the obvious for many, new SSDs have to be formatted. It's not just a matter of switching out the hard drive and restoring via Time Machine. I found out the hard way and then followed these instructions... http://www.cnet.com/how-to/upgrade-your-macbook-install-ssd-hard-drive/. The new drive is working great. The CNET recommended software is free (trial version) and was very easy to follow. The copying process took about three hours. Outcomes... painfully slow startup time has been reduced to a few seconds. My excessively large Gmail inbox loads very quickly now. These are just a couple of examples to illustrate greatly improved overall performance.<br /><br />Buy the SATA cable, NOT INCLUDED WITH THE SSD (should be), thus four stars versus five."
4.0,"I suffer from carpal tunnel and this mouse has been a life saver. I tried the Apple trackpad, and I tried the Anker vertical mouse--both were better than a traditional mouse for me, but neither quite gave me the relief that this one does. My only complaint is it is a bit cheaply made - it tipped over and fell a couple of feet, and the bottom completely separated from the top. I couldn't get it to seal tightly again. Sent it back for a replacement which I got, and am waiting for confirmation that the trade in was accepted. Even if it's cheaply made, it's the best thing I have found for my hand, so I would replace it again if needed."
4.0,OK
4.0,"perfect fit,but does not stick"
4.0,"I decided to write a quick review as I had been searching for a decent laptop at the $1000 price for quite some time before I decided to go with this one. So far after about 3 - 4 weeks of use the laptop has held up great. There have been very few issues with the WiFi as some people had been claiming (possibly caused by earlier iterations of the laptop itself / Network Adapter), the hard drive runs at a decent speed (however, I could imagine slower speeds for more intensive programs), and the build quality is very good. I would recommend installing or purchasing the laptop with an SSD if you're planning on using some intensive programs.<br /><br />As soon as I purchased the laptop I simply removed all the bloatware from the computer and upgraded to Windows 10. There have been a couple instances of updating Windows leading to the system never wanting to completely restart, but aside from these couple of times it has performed well. As for the heat, I haven't checked the CPU / GPU temperatures under load, but the laptop itself never reaches a heat that I would find uncomfortable to the touch.<br /><br />Overall, the laptop is a good deal for your money (I purchased the laptop for $900.00 during the back-to-school time frame, so I plan on adding an SSD soon with the saved money) that will perform well while *hopefully maintaining its reliability. Some small quirks - not sure if related to Windows 10 or not - provoked me to rate it 4-stars, but others may not have these issues. I will EDIT if I ever run into any additional problems."
4.0,Great product. Exactly as described
4.0,Easy to Install.  Fits perfectly.  A little flimsy with the material but OK.
4.0,"They arrived with the plastic packaging unsealed, but i have run into no issues. I plugged them up, booted up my computer, and voila. It recognizes 8gb."
4.0,"I received this portable charger by innogie for a product review and it is really cool. We used this portable charger on a road trip and found it to be super useful. The kids (all teens) absolutely loved that the top looks just like an alien when it is all lit up. I really like that this can work with so many different devices. Half out our road trip participants had iPhone and the other half had android. We were all able to use this charger for our phones. Not only did we use it for our phones, but we also used it for a variety of tablets and electronic readers. It takes less than an hour to completely charge the portable charger and then takes between 30 and 40 minutes to charge phones or devices on it, depending on the battery life when you plug it in to charge. My daughter and her friend used the charger to charge their devices while they played on it and it only delayed the charging slightly, but it still charged. This is a great item to have on hand. I like to use it when I know that I will be out of the house/car for long periods of time. It was perfect for our hike in the woods and mountains on our vacation."
4.0,It's one pricey wireless keyboard compared to the others all right.  The one thing it really impressed me with is the range.  With my previous keyboard sometimes I get dropouts or slow responses from the couch but this thing works perfectly.  The light is also very nice and works well.  My only gripe is you have to first press a key to turn it on so you have to choose some safe key to press.  I wish it worked like the Harmony One remote where when it detects movement it turns the lights on.  I'm happy with every aspect of it except one thing.  The battery doesn't last very long at all.  It lasts me about 3 weeks on one charge which is kind of crazy low.  I've had it for two months now and had to charge it three times after the initial charge.  My old keyboard with two AA batteries lasted 6 months and within a minute I could have it up and running with new batteries.  With this keyboard you have to plug it in to let it charge so it can be difficult or impossible to charge and use at the same time.  I even resorted to using one of those small battery banks so I can have the keyboard with me while it charged.  The only other con is it absorbs oil and fingerprints like a monster so if that sort of thing bothers you this may not be ideal.  The keyboard and keys have a matte finish that really shows off oil.  That doesn't bother me though but that battery thing does so four stars it is.
4.0,"Simple, neat.  The only negative:  a little smaller than expected."
4.0,Easiest router setup ever. The status display is much clearer and easier to interpret than the flashing LEDs on typical routers. Haven't had long enough to speak to reliability.
4.0,Used to put SD memory cards into a DSLR that only took CF memory cards.  A big improvement all the way around!!<br />No need to keep both types of cards.  Have had zero problems
4.0,For an older AP these work great. Very easy to set up and use.
4.0,Stretches out of shape eventually.
4.0,ncie
4.0,great cover!
4.0,Binding is fragile  I have broken 3.  Customer service  made good  with replacements each time
4.0,Good price
4.0,So far so good!

4.0,Good.
4.0,"It's ok. Office 365 for one year, except you can't use Power points 2013 on the laptop. HP drop box not worth it . HP is now cancelling their drop box in October 2015, I just purchased HP Stream 13 in April 2015.  Included $25 gift card for the Windows Store from Microsoft however, Microsoft then emails you several times to let you know if you do not use your gift card within the first eight weeks after you register for Office 365, they remove from your Windows Store account the balance of the gift card. The minimum amount for the maintenance on the HP Stream 13 Laptop for one year is $149. There is only 2GB memory, one app from the Windows Store and you are then out of disk space. Microsoft customer support team suggests you purchase he external hard drive for $119 plus tax. T-mobile free 4G data for life except you can only use that for 200MB each month, so make sure there are no other programs running at the time you might need to use your free 200MB broad band connection. You will only be connected for about 20minutes."
4.0,Very nice little tablet for my 6 year old grandchild to play games on.
4.0,Great keyboard; works with Asus ChromeBox OpenElec configuration. It allows me to dual boot to either ChromeOS or Kodi.<br /><br />Very responsive and like it. Would be great if it was backlit.
4.0,"Love this sticker, would have liked the application to be easier, or at least include the items it suggested to use to apply to the computer."
4.0,good
4.0,Very helpful.
4.0,"This mouse has a pretty awesome battery life so far.  I think I've been using this for a month now with 1 battery and it's still running strong.  Love the fact I can program and G buttons on the side to whatever I want.  The game detection doesn't work too well in my opinion but the only game I play is League of Legends so I can't say much about other games.  The only thing I don't like about the mouse is that it is quite heavy.  Because of the weight, using the mouse for a long period does take a toll on you.  My wrist and arm would feel tired from using such a heavy mouse and using it to play League of Legends isn't something that would help improve your game.  All in all, I wish the mouse would weigh less and had hyper scrolling but at least the battery life is great."
4.0,"This is probably one of the cheapest keyboards you can buy. Having said that, this keyboard is perfectly serviceable for most users. There aren't any media keys (volume up/down, next/previous, pause, etc.), but if you don't need media keys this keyboard will work perfectly for most users.   EDIT: I have docked it one star after some further analysis. After I bought a new keyboard to replace this K120, I decided it would be funny to rearrange the keycaps. While most of the letter keys could be swapped around, I was disappointed to discover that the F and J key will only fit in their intended spots. In other words, this keyboard can't be rearranged for any layout other than standard QWERTY."
4.0,This has helped me greatly with my early stages of carpal tunnel. I'll be getting a second one for the office soon.
4.0,"This does a very respectable job cooling, it keeps my i5-6600k nice and cool even at full load without having to spin too fast or make much noise.<br /><br />The downside is that it is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE to install in a confined space. If you are building a new machine with this I would strongly recommend installing this before anything else and probably before mounting your motherboard, otherwise this is a fantastic cooler for the price."
4.0,Works great came all the way from China.
4.0,"The battery is performing well after a few weeks of use in my 15&#34; 2009 Macbook Pro.  It fit exactly like the OEM, and its performance rivals the original.  The computer recognized it with no problem.  It had a cycle count of 0.<br /><br />I used iFixIt's installation guide.  The one problem was that the Pentalobe screwdriver that was included was not the correct size needed for this installation. (it was smaller, appeared to be a P2 rather than the necessary P6)  I had an iFixIt kit that had a P6 otherwise I would have been dead in the water with my laptop disassembled..."
4.0,I had trouble getting the program to start. Eventually the technician gave me one more thing to try and it worked.  Found a couple viruses!
4.0,good product
4.0,Quick transfer speeds
4.0,great
4.0,"A little bulky, but does the job! Still using it, and haven't had to replace since buying over a year ago."
4.0,"Plug 'n Play ready on OpenElec via a RPi2, so no complaints of the actual driver support or build quality on opening (actually it was also fully packaged which is a bit shocking with my history of buying (admittedly cheap) usb bluetooth adapters online). It is a little pricey compared to what I'm used to, but will update to fivestar in some months if the few extra bucks proves themself to mean it will hold up better (than the aforementioned  cheapies) as well."
4.0,"Fits well, seems to work okay, battery life hasn't changed much-still about 3 to 4 hours with my model Toshiba."
4.0,"Works great for my iPad and for my slim laptop. Keeps both propped up nicely while sitting. I wish the angle was a tiny bit higher while you are lounging back, but it's still great. I definitely recommend it."
4.0,No issues with this power cord after a few weeks of use. It seems like it's possibly made of cheaper materials than the OEM cords but for the price point I don't think you can ask for much more than what you get with this product. I would definitely recommend this cord for others looking to replace old worn out cords.
4.0,Cute and packaged really nice but the head is pretty lose when you put it back together so don't lose his bottom half!
4.0,Love them.
4.0,Good case. Great price.
4.0,"Awesome way to keep the keyboard clean. In my busy life, as badly as I want to keep my keyboard free of dust crumbs and coffee drips, its hard. This keyboard cover helps in a major way. Easy on easy off. Easy to clean!"
4.0,nice aluminium finifhed.<br />USB cable prvided is not USB 3.0
4.0,This screen replacement was for my laptop that I have dropped. The screen broke and didn't work anymore. Installs pretty easily. Just take caution when handling
4.0,The case is as described and works well. The only thing I do not like is the keyboard cover which is a slightly different color than the case itself.
4.0,"Great product for the price - does the job very well. My only complaint is the non-intuitive menu navigation, which could use some fixing. Otherwise, very nice."
4.0,It works well as a replacement power supply for my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.  It even came with a nice bag.
4.0,"Works well and the price was right.  Setup was a little tough, however.  When you go to the IP Address to secure the network, the IP Address given for the unit is off one digit.  Technical Help, helped resolve the issue, but when they tell you to reboot, it doesn't mean shut down the computer and restart, it means hit the &#34;reboot&#34; button on the left side panel of the setup dialog.  A little confusing when the technical help person speaks limited English."
4.0,so far so good
4.0,"I purchased this enclosure to build an external drive for my Xbox one. The features are pretty great for the price,  Usb 3.0 and can utilize up to a 4tb drive. Also, it will work with a 2.5&#34; drive as well as a 3.5&#34;. The outer shell is composed of aluminum, and features an asteticly pleasing brushed look.  The inner shell that you attach the drive too is plastic.  I would have preferred aluminum as well for better heat transfer,  but the plastic doesn't seem to really hinder anything.  The front of the enclosure has a small blue led that flashes when  the drive is being utilized and stays a solid blue when it's not.  I do not find it distracting at all. I used the included instructions to attach the drive and build the enclosure,  it only took a couple min.  Before I knew it,  I was plugging it in to the back of my Xbox one and let the Xbox do its thing.  All in all this is one of the few enclosures out there that had everything I needed to build a 3.5&#34; external drive for an Xbox one and is a solid choice for those looking to do the same."
4.0,"I really like this little table. It works great with my Surface pro 3. I love the fan option as it helps keep it cool, because with long use they do get a little hot. It is actually good construction since the legs are plastic. They work great. It is a little wobbly if you use it from the floor so I just put it up against my coffee table as I work on my sofa. It is great in bed, takes up a little room but really gives me a good table to work on with no fear of things overheating."
4.0,The two side buttons for front and back page functionality are a bit low for my taste and as a result I tend to accidentally push them.  I would rather that they were not included or that I could disable them somehow.
4.0,Best feature is the ability to use iPad landscape and portrait with ease.  Love the color.  Mine is blue.
4.0,"Works great, shipping was longer than expected, but to be fair it came from China ."
4.0,Easy to use. I debated between this and the paperwhite. I read the most in bed so now I am wishing I had purchased the back lit paperwhite. I'm sure I will find a case for this one which has a light included or a separate light that will actually fit into the case.
4.0,I've been very careful with it and the corners are already starting to break
4.0,"OK here's my take on fabricating Ethernet cables using these connectors. I have basically spent my entire adult life fabricating, repairing and installing cables of all types. It's a fact that some cables are a cinch to make and others will make you want to tear your hair out. The trick of course is understanding the technique. Easy to say, hard to do sometimes. Instead of reprinting a step-by-step instruction , here are a few tips for those who want to try this.<br /><br />1) After you comb the wire out and order the colors according to the standard you need, cut them all on a diagonal. This will make it easy to insert the wires in the loading bar in the correct order.<br />2) Pay attention to the loading bar (read the review titled &#34;INSTRUCTIONS!!!&#34;  for more info on this<br />3) Check colors one more time and push loading bar down the wire<br />4) Insert into connector and crimp<br />5) Test with Ethernet cable tester (dirt cheap here on Amazon)<br /><br />All said and done it is a tedious process at first but like anything else it gets easier as you get more experience. Prepare to waste a few (dozen) connectors while you are learning the technique."
4.0,"Works great. My drive fits snugly and it encloses everything well and keeps my drive safe.<br /><br />I don't love that it has a standard USB connection on the case, instead of the more standard mini USB. I have tons of mini USB to USB cords lying around, but only the one usb-usb that came with this case. I knew that before I bought it, obviously. But this wast he best cost and had the best reviews. 10/10 case with a fantastic price, but a more standard connection cable would be nice."
4.0,"The pendant was beautiful but the chain was broken and stuffed into the back of the pendant.  It arrived in a round tin box which had several bumps and dings.  I planned to give this as a gift but couldn't due to the damage.  Returned for refund, no problems."
4.0,Fits my Fire perfectly  Wish it had a good elastic piece to hold my stylus
4.0,works good
4.0,I got my battery on time and no problems.
4.0,Very good drive for the price. No complaints. Plays all my DVDs and CDS.
4.0,"The case doesn't hold the tablet very secure, but love them other than that"
4.0,Doing the job so far what more can you ask.
4.0,Love the sturdiness of this case and the kickstand.  Sometimes it takes a minute to figure out which way the kickstand opens and it catches sometimes but I always figure it out and it's holding up nicely.
4.0,"I loved it, the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is the back is a little too smooth to hold it securely. I'm sure after a little while it will get rough up, but I wish it was a little more 'grippy'."
4.0,Good Product
4.0,"Update on my previous review - the charging function works fine with some USB devices attached, such as flash drives or cameras, just doesn't work with an external USB HDD that needs power from the USB port.  So I'm giving it an extra star."
4.0,This would be perfect if the surface is metal.
4.0,I unlocked this CPU to enable the 4th core and its performing well.
4.0,good product
4.0,"Keeps everything where it needs to be, good buy"
4.0,"Dirty computers look better, overall."
4.0,The Sandisk Ultra 16GB compact memory card was what I expected for size and speed
4.0,Mouse works good but I wish it had a horizontal scrolling wheel
4.0,"Quite impressed with both the look and sound of these, for a very reasonable price.  Had to deduct one star because they really need screens - I almost put my thumb through one already.  And also the power light is way too bright, like is common nowadays."
4.0,"I haven't had a chance to really test this product out to its highest potential. Yet, but it was worth the money. It wasn't hard to install. As a matter of fact it was quite simple. Read the instructions and you Shouldn't have any problems. The mechanisms are little awkward mounting to a motherboard, but once you get associated with exactly what's going on. It went simply awesome"
4.0,"As advertised.  I was looking for a dust cover for my multipurpose printer, but there was not one available for my particular printer.  Went by manufacturers dimensions, selected a cover that would fit over the top by just tall enough to cover keypad.  This cover worked perfectly for my purposes.  Seems well made and I anticipate it lasting as long as my printer."
4.0,"Case fits well and functions great.  The keys don't have a great feel and the overall package is a little bulky and heavy.  It also doesn't hold very well in the closed position and I get concerned that it doesn't stay off when closed.  All in all, a good solution that I would probably buy again."
4.0,It works as advertised and delivery was good Thanks Eric
4.0,as stated and checked all of them and they work
4.0,"Received this battery in a timely manner, and it's working fine."
4.0,"I received this NAS free from Netgear as part of a friends and family product testing group. As soon as I received it, it went into a new rack we had just set up for our office. Installation and configuration was super fast and easy. And with in a few minutes it was online and ready to rock. The management website makes the administration of this device a breeze. The iSCSI connection was also quick and easy to configure and set up. We were needing a NAS to provide back up storage for our servers and the 2120 fit our needs perfectly. I would highly recommend this product for businesses needing to expand their storage."
4.0,"Great led, kinda too bright when reading."
4.0,thx
4.0,Works well
4.0,Still working!
4.0,"While I have to restart my laptop every time my cursor lags, it has been very useful nonetheless. I just wish it wouldn't lag every 3rd or 4th time I connect it to my laptop."
4.0,good product
4.0,Works great but I wish it had different speeds
4.0,Great Product. Easy to clean and keeps my computer cool!
4.0,no complaints
4.0,"Very nice, good value.  Just wish the hinge piece were a bit stiffer/stronger as it droops a bit when I put it on a stand after folding the cover back.  Mostly I wanted something to protect the front screen and this does it nicely."
4.0,"I ordered the black with white dots version of this mouse for $5.61. Looks like space somewhat. Shipping was stated to be 1-4 months, but I received this in two weeks. I'm guessing the long estimate is because they don't declare the package delivered until much later than it's arrival. Only had this mouse for a few days and the entire family likes it. Finger ridges for thumb, ring and pinky finger work great. Braided cord is fairly easy to let go of the sharp bends from packaging. Couple of points need to be made clear, though.<br /><br />1.) I can't tell what the DPI settings for this mouse are other than that the highest setting is 2000, but I have four different settings rather than the three stated. Little plus.<br /><br />2.) There is a ridge in the decorated portion of the mouse, running from just under the DPI button all the way down to the bottom. The point at the bottom of the mouse in the picture can help clarify. The ridge juts upward slightly, so it's nearly impossible to hold this with a flat palm comfortably. Shift your palm to the left a little when setting your hand down and it will be fine.<br /><br />3.) The colors on mine cycle. Yeah, BIG plus on aesthetics. Starts off at red, then green, and yada yada. There must be two different LED's or something inside, because there's a different cycle rate for different areas of the mouse. The scroll wheel and thumb buttons eventually become uncoordinated with the &#34;Weyes&#34; emblem and the lines on either side. Three different rectangles at the bottom back of the mouse usually show the color of the logo, but when it's red there is a bit of bleeding from the scroll wheel color on the right of the middle rectangle. I personally don't care about the change in cycle rate, I think it's a cool defect if anything<br /><br />4.) The scroll wheel feels cheap and actual scrolling quality leaves something to be desired. When scrolling very fast, the sensor tends to read your scroll in the opposite direction i.e. if you're scrolling down the page will start to go up. Certain games such as Waframe seem to really pronounce this problem. For games, I would program any &#34;next&#34; or &#34;previous&#34; options to the front and back keys. Scroll wheel click is fine<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with this mouse. The edge and scroll wheel are barely even cons. Shipping time is a bit long if you get used to a five day max but not a deal breaker at all. Give this a go; you won't regret it.f you're scrolling down the page will start to go up.

4.0,worked well. easy to use.

4.0,for my son
4.0,This bag is way awesome..for school and weekend trips ..we love it.
4.0,"The case is what I expected.  Very similiar to my Otterbox for my Samsung Cell phone.  Gives the Kindle Fire 6HD a little more heft to it, and makes it easier to handle.  Also has the protective screen, which works well with the Kindle's touch screen."
4.0,"To establish some background, I love gadgets and I love reviewing them. I also happen to have a pretty favorable view of the Google gadgets I've used so far: the Nexus phones and tablets, Chromebooks and the Chromecast. And Google's Chrome is the default browser on my Windows laptop. If this could indicate some bias well... I am always trying to be fair and objective when evaluating a new product and I jumped at the opportunity to try out Google's OnHub because it's the first Google router so it's something new. What follows are my impressions.<br /><br />By the way, I've used, tested and evaluated a number of routers in the past, mostly Netgear, TP-Link and Linksys and a few off-brand models.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br /><br />The first thing that you will notice when taking the OnHub out of the box is how pretty it is. Many routers that I've used including my current Netgear Nighthawk look good but near all of them have the industrial good looks and are meant to be kept out of sight, preferably in the basement. OnHub is living room pretty because Google wants you to keep it some place near the center of your house so that everybody could get a good signal. I would love to be able to take my router out of the basement but it wouldn't be so easy for me because that's where out Internet tap happens to be but, anyone whose Internet connection is in the living quarters would have a good reason to be happy with the OnHub because it should feel like it belonged on a bookshelf or some other visible place. My unit has a dark blue skin but it's removable and easily replaceable and I suspect that alternative shells will be available in the future.<br /><br />Now, for the setup, this 802.11ac device is designed to do most of the dirty setup work by itself, out of sight and out of mind because most of us have better things to do. It's done through an Android or iOS app and it's as simple and friendly as any router setup has ever been, couple of minutes to set it up. Once operational, the app tells me who/what is connected to my networks, how much bandwidth is taken by each device, even how good a bandwidth I have. For example, it advised me to ask my provider for a higher bandwidth service because what I have now was not good enough to support Ultra HD.<br /><br />Operation can be super-easy if you only want to do the basic things. Should be able to allow others to remotely manage the router through the phone app but I didn't try it yet. On the finer points, there is no QoS (quality of service) per se but you can reserve bandwidth to certain devices if needed. No parental control features yet. And, something that I wish it was there, I wasn't able to assign different network names for the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz bands which is what I currently have on my other router setup. One network name to rule them all is good from an ease of use point of view but it would be better if the one network setting was the default but we still had the ability to segregate the bands if we chose to do so. Operation/control is overall 'good' for most users and I suspect it's only going to get better as the software gets updates and more features are supported.<br /><br />As for performance, it's almost as good as our current router but that is a more expensive beast and a more mature product so, no surprises there. I can't place the OnHub anywhere other than the basement but I could easily connect a signal booster to it and everything was good and smooth. For anyone who cares about tech details, this router has 13 (thirteen!) antennas, half a dozen each for the 2.4GHz and  5GHz bands with the 13th beaming a strong signal and, allegedly, constantly attempting to detect an overcrowded channel in use and switch you off of it. It's expected to support Bluetooth in the future but not now. Also noted that it comes with 4GB of internal storage. The USB port can't be used to attach anything to it at this time.<br /><br />For ports... well... this is supposed to bea near-pure Wi-Fi router so there aren't too many. Besides the unusable USB port and Ethernet in and Ethernet out and that's just about it. Didn't try to attach anything to USB but I did successfully expand/split the Ethernet port by attaching a small switch to it.<br /><br />MY RATING AND EVALUATION<br /><br />The OnHub gets an excellent (5 stars) rating for its looks and ease of setup and operation. Without exaggerating much, anyone who can use a phone should have no problem whatsoever setting up and operating this router. The Android app is friendly and, while not providing too many details on the router's operation upfront, it manages to keep me informed about things that I really care such as bandwidth utilization and who's connected to the router at any given time.<br /><br />Signal strength is good. I won't say that better than our Nighthawk's but, had we had the ability to place the OnHub in a more central area in the house, we would have had a stronger signal. The 13 antennas are internal, by the way, so there's no need to optimally  position them by hand and that does add to the 'ease of use' aspect.<br /><br />My main beef at this time is the lack of physical ports. Wi-Fi routers, traditionally, come with 4 Ethernet ports and a couple of USBs. Yes, most of the devices in our house are wireless but, believe it or not, some do need or at least benefit greatly from a wired attachment. In our case there's a VoIP box, a NAS (network attached storage) and a Powerline adapter wired-connected and that's 3 ports. The 4th is taken by a mini-router we had to use because our iFit-ready treadmill would not talk to the main router but was able to connect to the mini-router. Yes, you can plug in a Hub but that kind of defeats the goal of 'few wires' and slightly complicates everything.<br /><br />My current rating is 4 stars, with one star deducted for the lack of (needed) physical ports, for the lack of an interface that would give an almost-geek like me more control over the settings and for what I would say is too high a price.a near-pure Wi-Fi router so there aren't too many.

4.0,Excellent ergonomic keyboard.  Could be better if the function/media were not small/hard to press.
4.0,"Arrived quick, works well, easy to set up. It is a little glitchy but never any problems to be concerned about."
4.0,"This is a very clever little case.  The &#34;origami&#34; stand feature takes a bit of getting used to.  You often have an urge to fold it opposite the way it's supposed to go.  Outside of that, it is a nice cover with magnetic closure.  Also, the push-up feature for the rear view camera is very cleverly done.  It's apparent that Amazon designed the Fire Camera to work with this case.  Just pushing the tablet up in the case until you feel it lock into a new position activates the camera software immediately without even bothering to log into the tablet itself.  Very nice."
4.0,"Works fine, but broke his feet the first wee trying to pull the cover off. It fits very snugly."
4.0,"I love this cover!! I purchased the same style for my iphone 5 (twice) and wanted to match my ipad four. It looks nice and really looks like a book. The screen is slightly covered a bit on the sides, but does not really hinder anything. I like that I can stick cards or notes in the attached holder."
4.0,"I got the 13- 13.3&#34; size. My laptop is actually only 11.6&#34; So I had a lot of wiggle room in mine. At first I thought it might have been too big, but reading the many comments on here talking about how they ordered the 15-15.6&#34; one but it didn't fit their 15.6&#34; laptop, I was kind of glad that I got the bigger sized one. Here are some of the things I like and dislike about this:<br /><br />Liked:<br />-Design: I thought the design was cute, but not &#34;girly&#34;. I like that its gender neutral.<br />-Extra Bag: I like that it came with a matching adapter bag, but unfortunately it was too small to fit my charger for the laptop, it however fit my mouse just fine.<br />-Quality: I'd say overall quality of the material, stitching, etc. is good. You do have to consider this is FELT. So for felt, this is pretty thick. Its thicker than your typical craft felt. You cannot compare it to things such as leather or vinyl.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-All Felt Fabric: Please note that this is ALL felt! When it says &#34;felt & real leather' the &#34;real leather&#34; part is just that orange strap going down the middle you see in the picture. It serves no purpose. The case itself is felt inside and out. There is no additional lining on the inside, it is that exact same grey felt you see in the picture in and out.<br />-Single Magnetic Closure: Obviously with this design you can see which end is up pretty easily but in case you pick this up upside-down by accident, the closure is not as secure as a zipper one. I don't think the one magnetic clasp is strong enough to prevent the laptop from falling out.<br />-Narrow: My laptop is about .50&#34; thick, and once I close the clasp it didn't poke up or anything but this is a very narrow &#34;pouch&#34;, and I can see thicker laptops not fitting. There is a second pocket on the inside right above the main pocket but because this pouch is so thin I can't see you being able to put anything in that pocket unless its paper.<br /><br />I don't travel too much with my laptop so this case works for me. Its just something to put my laptop in so it doesn't collect dust on my desk. If you are looking for something that really does a good job &#34;protecting&#34; then I don't think this is it. But for light use, I think its fine.<br /><br />(*I purchased this item with my own money at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion)"
4.0,Really like this case.  Would have rated it a 5 except I have a slight problem getting it to stand (probably me and not the case)  Adds no extra bulk or weight. Well worth the cost.
4.0,got it in a timely manor installed and worked perfectly
4.0,Works great and quickly. easy to setup after it gets charged the first time.
4.0,I like it and just need a cus. ser. rep to ask a few questions as iam not really a android expert.
4.0,I should have looked at the size.  I would have liked a slightly bigger one and one with more padding.  The decorative design is great!
4.0,works well in my surveillance enclosures
4.0,"For what you are paying for them, these speakers are incredible.  I tested the issue that some people are reporting with other sets going into sleep mode. The speakers will go into a sleep mode if the input volume is too low. This can be rectified by making sure your input volume is around 50% or higher. I usually keep the input volume around 75% and adjust volume with the included control unit, and have not experienced this issue (other than recreating it for testing). As others noted, the system has a good mid range, moderate bass, but is some what lacking in the high range. It could probably even use a little more amp than what it came with, with out much distortion."
4.0,"[[VIDEOID:a1c11d7cfa7370214140a77fc36120d3]] Moshi makes very good products at a premium price. I love this keyboard cover because it's easy to forget that it's there. My old one has saved my keyboard from spills that should never be there in the first place but sometimes I just forget about that cup of very needed coffee.  Hopefully, the video review will be clear enough to  illustrate the ease of putting git on and the effectiveness of the protection. s<br /><br />The Key board in the video was just shorted because coffee got under it!  Something very ironic about that."
4.0,"Ease of use<br />Setup & Simplicity is off the charts<br />However, a more snug fit would of been ideal?"
4.0,"This Rii mini Keyboard is a great solution for my home media PC. It is compact, easy to use, and the price is great. However, the mouse track pad can be non-responsive at time which requires me to turn it off and on again. I wish the range were a bit longer but it does the job."
4.0,It has all worked as expected
4.0,"Before buying my first Mac, I'd always used basic PC's and whatever peripherals came packaged with them. My Mac mini came with no peripherals. It didn't seem fully compatible with my junky old HP keyboard. This keyboard is a revelation. I love the feel of the keys, their firm touch and rssponsive-ness make typing much easier. What bothers me is the white color. It's dirty already, and I'm a very regular hand-washer. Yes, I could buy a heavy ugly plastic cover to type through; but that's like the ladies who keep their good living room furniture set encased in plastic so it won't get soiled. Completely undoes the beauty of the design. In general, I'm quite bemused by Apple design. I believe that function is as vital as beauty, and that the two must go hand in hand. Early iPhones with exquisite forms and plastic backs that scratch so easily that they must be hidden in those ghastly jelly cases? The sleekly elegant Mac mini that comes with no peripherals built in and only a few USB slots, so you need to add a big USB hub and an ugly tangle of cables for the back-up drive, keyboard, mouse, speakers, CD player, card reader, photo and laser printers. Enough of my Apple rant. The keyboard is smudged and glorious."
4.0,"I really like the back-lit screen; the illumination is even and there's no glare; it can be adjusted to fit the ambient level of light.<br /><br />As a book reader it's good.  I still have my old Kindle with the buttons to compare with.  I like the buttons a bit more than the tap of the Paperwhite but I like the Paperwhite screen and text more than the old Kindle's.<br /><br />The web browser uses a different interface than the book reader which has confused me.  For example, when you want to get more of the page, you 'swipe up' instead of 'tap for next page'.  In the Kindle store a swipe-up motion often is taken as a tap-to-select motion and I often find that I can't use links on pages (e.g. on the page of results from a Google search).  I tap the link but it's not selected and not gone-to.  You will probably say &#34;Of course, it's not a tablet&#34;, and I will agree but the old Kindle can go through a link on a page, once you 'mouse' down to it with the five-way selector.<br /><br />I got this because I wanted the lit screen and the smaller form-factor.  I'm quite happy with it for those reasons."
4.0,As expected
4.0,Good quality FLAT ethernet cable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good quality wire and connectors<br />-Doesn't easily tangle<br /><br />Cons:<br />-none so far
4.0,This is the second time I have purchased this product but last time it was for my phone...I really loved the price for starters compared to a zagg cover or some other expensive ones. I love that there are 2 in the box! The method in which to apply then is a little extensive and the numbers on my products were backwards from the picture but getting the jist of the method was not difficult to figure it out. The material is not a completely clear film but rather has a slight frost to it. This doesn't effect the ability to see through it clearly once applied and I guess is what allows it to have it fingerprintless quality. It doesn't bother me one bit and I love not seeing fingerprints all over my screen. I would not hesitate to purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend!!
4.0,Paid to much.  Found it cheaper but still works as expected.
4.0,Yassss
4.0,"I was hoping it would last a little longer.  Certainly better than the old, dead one we had, but we're only getting 1.5 hours or so out of this new one."
4.0,This is a great cooling fan. It has the three fans so it really works well. The lights look cool also. It is very light so if you drop it I'm sure it would break easy
4.0,good product
4.0,It works
4.0,Pretty much works as promised. Max volume could be a little higher.
4.0,Worked
4.0,Well made and priced right.  Shipped on time.
4.0,Everything works fine except the program. Sometimes I cannot change the settings.
4.0,"It fits on the keyboard but i wish there was a way to keep make ot stay easier, bought it for work so i dont get grease on the keys i work in a garage so it will do its purpose."
4.0,like it
4.0,Holds up well. Using in car for 7inch tab 4
4.0,"Good combo.  Definitely not the best but for the price it's absolutely wonderful.  Sometimes the keyboard lags but it's not often.  I wish the buttons were more flat similar to the Logitech solar keyboard or apple keyboard but again, for the price it's a great combo.  If you are on a budget, buy it!  Oh and it worked instantly without having to run any setup wizard on a windows 10 computer."
4.0,"The adapter works fine. The only problem is the driver. The setup file name is in Chinese, so it would not install from the CD. You have to copy the contents to your computer and rename the setup file so that it does not have Chinese characters."
4.0,We have sold a bunch of these with hardly any problems. They have worked well for us.
4.0,I had to disconnect the fan because of the high amount of noise it made.<br />Found two of the four medal nuts supporting the motor loose and laying on the motherboard.<br />Found two of the case nylon nuts also loose and located in the raspberry PI protecting wrapping.
4.0,"I purchased this 7-Port USB Hub because the old PC that my dad has does not have any front ports on it. Now we have seven additional USB ports as well as the 6 in the back. 13 USB ports may seem like a lot, but I have plenty of devices to connect to them.<br /><br />The product meets all of my needs perfectly. The design is good, all of the ports, switches, and lights function well. For only $4.95 with no tax or shipping to pay, the only thing that made it better was that I had a gift card to pay it with.<br /><br />I cannot give it 5 stars because the ports are touchy. Once a device is plugged in, it cannot even be moved while plugged into the port without disconnecting the device. This poses a problem for those that use flash drives and memory cards frequently. However, since I mounted it to the side of my desk, it poses no problems to me."
4.0,"Fantastic computer for the price that I picked it up for. The description stated that it was a scratch and dent , but in all honestly it took 3 hours of looking HARD to find the 1/4 .in scratch . This was the best computer I have had ever, however the only problem is the mouse pad on this laptop. The mouse pad buttons on this computer are flushed so there is not visual, or felt indicator of left click right click. So if you are to far to the right on the clicker area you will get the right click drop down menus. Other than that the computer runs great"
4.0,"Seems pretty good so far. I have it partitioned into 5 drives for media server storage. I didn't install any Samsung software, since I already have backups of the data."
4.0,it fit perfectly.....easy install...
4.0,"I would give this five stars if it would have came with zipper lubricant. The zippers need lubricant right out of the box, they do not move easily. Other than that it is a great bag with lots of compartments and is well built."
4.0,It was just what I needed.
4.0,"Holds up pretty well, nice snug fit. I have a four year old who beats up the Ipad mini quite a bit but the case is doing a good job protecting the drop, falls, and throws. The reason it is not receiving a five star because the design makes it hard to plug in the charger. Otherwise it is really good. I would recommend it."
4.0,This Western Digital hard drive has been great! It's lightweight fits in my camera bag and with USB 3.0 transfer speeds it's super quick. Great drive if you need something portable.
4.0,Dual Band. Excellent value.
4.0,good product
4.0,"One heck of a way to refurb a very expensive Apple laptop cord! I'll say that it takes more effort to crack open the casing to access the solders to the silicon board than I figured. Keep in mind it was sealed without the intent of being opened!<br /><br />That said, it works like new and I hope to get another 4 years out of the charger! I'd recommend splicing the cord to someone not as inclined to see it all the way through...I'm pretty technically/mechanically inclined and I'd hesitate to go through the hassle a second time if it didn't finish off looking so much cleaner!'"
4.0,"Product works great.  My son no longer drives me nuts with constant clicking in the back seat of the car.  Service is great too.  Dongle had a problem and they had a new one on my doorstep in 4 days, no charge.  Too soon to speak about longevity."
4.0,"I was a bit weary about the look of this table...but it's awesome. I set it up by my window and I do my homework, it helps with my neck and back pain. It is super light weight and kinda flimsy feeling, but it is sturdy and easy to adjust. I recommend it."
4.0,"Really like the device. Works right out of the box as does the software download need for different devices. Running with a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; 2nd generation and an Apple iPad and using the 4 Port HooToo USB hub. Great throughput and distance. No longer need to download my media to individual device in order to access it. Will be using mainly on trips beginning in a couple of weeks. Will update review once we know how it does on planes, ships and in hotel rooms."
4.0,"Very fast (as advertised), but will not fit 2 side by side or on top of each other with standard USB port spacing"
4.0,"Nice board. I use it for pfsense. Only problem is that on-board NIC can't handle high speed. If your internet connection is faster then 80MB you will have inconsistent download speeds. To get around this, you can use a Intel PRO/1000 MT Dual Port Server Adapter PCI/PCI-X card from ebay. (&#60;$15) Only thing is you have to use a bigger case. I've tested this for 200MB download with no problems."
4.0,"Just finished pulling 4000 ft of this cable through new construction and didn't have any issues.  I would recommend that as you get closer to the end of the spool you will want to unroll the length of cable you need and stretch it out.  This will help keep the cable from kinking.  This is common sense with any coax product no matter what vendor.  I would purchase this again as the cable quality and insulation were adequate.  I have not terminated this cabling yet, so I cannot comment on the ease to install compression ends at this time."
4.0,"The little plate for the camera, and the home button were not included. My oversight. The tools were a nice bonus and the screen works well. The screen had some flex to it and allows for the home button to be pressed without actually pressing the home button. Over all the repair process went well."
4.0,fit well as others have said connector is a little bit to long but other than that pleased with product
4.0,I like it but 14&#34; is far too big for my Surface Pro 3 - and I mean a lot.
4.0,Solid but limited life.  Second one in two years.
4.0,"I had to call to find out how to use it, but other than that, I really, really like the backlighting."
4.0,Very good price for a good quality product
4.0,"Range is decent, speeds cap out at about 20-25 Mbps (probably due to noise) and I am not thrilled I can't really change any advance wireless settings. But it is simple, reliable, easy to install and gets the job done."
4.0,"Added this to the side panel on my Phantom full tower case, one of the drive bays was open with out me realizing it. The fan was on when I put the  side panel back on hit the open drive bay an broke some blades on the fan. Reorder. Just make sure you got clearance in your case."
4.0,all worked came in on time
4.0,"Fits perfectly and the stand functions just as well as the Apple ones.  One thing to know is that while the Apple ones magnetically stick to the side of the iPad to attach the two, for this one to work, it places a cover that fits over the back of the iPad.  In other words, for the Apple one, the back is exposed, if you like to see and feel the iPad as is.  For this one, the back is covered, which may make it feel a slight bit more bulkier to some and may be less desirable if you want to feel the uncovered iPad back when you hold it."
4.0,"Works great on mac @ USB3 speeds even with mixed devices attached. heavy base keeps it up right with multiple cords plugged in, PS seems ok. I've been ok with several USB3 HD's all running at once.  downside is they copied stiff apple cable for OS and USB3 so they are a pain. tend to be too stiff and do what they want rather than allow easy positioning.  We'll see  how long the PS lasts as thats usually the weak point with this things.  UPDATE1 : appears non functional after week of use. ok plugged it into USB2 port on older mac. drive attached to it came to life. moved it back to MBP with USB3, now it works. flaky ! seems like USB2 resets something in the hub hardware so it works again.  UPDATE 2: after posting this review, some one from the company contacted me. he sent me replacement unit that is working fine after a week or so of use. it looks like I just got a bad unit, that happens, but they stood behind the product and gave me no hassle replacement. thanks !!!! wish all companies took care of their customers this way !"
4.0,"Works much better than what I had before, so love it but could be better..."
4.0,Overall great product.  Used primarily for entertainment.  Sharp display and easy to interface with.  Very good value for the price!
4.0,Installed to my PC easy.  It's small and compact so it doesn't look bulky or in the way in my home office.
4.0,"Cables work as intended. Have a few extra left over for other projects down the road. Good size, right fit!"
4.0,"Excellent service and product. Could not ask for faster postage and solid packaging.<br />The Tablet is exactly as described and runs like a dream. Lots of power for such a small unit and build quality was very good. The screen is HD as described, but as some other reviews have mentioned you do have to be looking at it almost straight on to get the best view. It is too shiny...like a glossy photo that you have to hold at just right angle to see properly. It is something that I have gotten used to quickly though.<br />I use the Tablet mainly for reading books on Kindle and the screen is excellent for that. The only other thing is the battery life. It is just as Simbans advertise at about 4 to 6 hours. But what they don't mention is that it does charge very quickly!<br />Over all I am very happy with my new Simbans Tablet. I did not buy it expecting a $500 Tablet for $49.95, but what I did get exceeded my expectations."
4.0,"It would have been helpful to have an instruction booklet, especially on the how and why of permissions which appears to hinder loading apps. Other than that it's a great unit with a very clkear display. Now how can I add more memory or erease that which I don't want.."
4.0,good for price
4.0,"My laptop was an old first generation i7 it became really hot since the last year. I rarely use it because of the problem it has but later decided to use it for one of my TVs I brought this cooling pad while it was the cheapest I can find and did not expect it to work nicely. However it did work pretty good. It has a single, large fan, without many big noises. I only wish I can turn off the LED lights."
4.0,"With four fans blowing air and one larger fan sucking air, this laptop cooler does the job. At approximately 14 3/4&#34; x 10 1/2&#34; our 17&#34; laptops do hang over the edge a little, but not enough to be detrimental. I was pleasantly surprised at the noise level. In other words  it was quiet. A nice feature is the ability to change the speed of the fans. Personally I think this is more likely to be set once and left alone, rather than changed when your machine gets hot, but that is great as different machines run hotter than others.<br /><br />Cons: Unlike some laptop coolers this one is not conducive to using on your lap, the design of the 'feet' make it a little uncomfortable on your legs.  Like a lounge chair it has an adjustable back so that you can have your laptop at the angle that is most comfortable for you. This of course creates extra height so your arms are higher when you are typing etc.<br /><br />Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Richard"
4.0,Pretty solid tablet thus far. Only about a week old and only freezes up a little bit every once in awhile. But everything mechanical seems to work fine. Especially for the price.
4.0,Its a cable. It works. Not much more to say!
4.0,"I swapped the ram from my MacBook Pro using this device, nothing fried so I assume it works fine. I used it a second time trying to fix a loose hinge and the motherboard unfortunately fried. Although, to be honest, I believe that happened through fault of my own."
4.0,Great little tablet/ book holder/ stand!
4.0,Great tablet nice size screen just find that touch screen is a little temperamental
4.0,Good
4.0,"So far I love this cover. It is gorgeous leather and just feels good in your hands. It fits the iPad Air 2 like a glove so it is sleek instead of making the sleek Air 2 big and bulky like other covers can.<br /><br />I really love the attention to detail that was obviously put into the technology that this is covering. No hindrance to any of the controls (volume, powers) or features (camera, mic, speakers, power port).<br /><br />My only disappointment is when you flip it over to make the iPad stand up. To do this is incredibly easy and intuitive. However don't expect to stand it up and then touch the machine without it falling over. It turns out to be top heavy when in the stand position. Not horrendous but be prepared to always use two hands if you need to touch it to navigate."
4.0,Worked perfect in using for my older pc. fixed the slow speed
4.0,"Does everything it is supposed to do just fine.  Nice, crisp display, quick response, and I can read my books in the dark.  Haven't got my cover yet, but it is on the way.  My only disappointment is that it is unable to download books and shop without a wi-fi hookup.  I sort of expected that it could.  Oh, well, maybe next time."
4.0,"It works, semi easy to install"
4.0,Love it
4.0,Thanks
4.0,nice
4.0,Nice item
4.0,"As a tablet, I'm not really fan when it comes to using the Fire for apps. It is great for Amazon Kindle features like Books, Instant Video and Music. Also pretty good for internet usage. A lot of value for the money."
4.0,"They worked with me and price matched the product, which I greatly appreciated. I really like the look and feel of the case. I ordered the mint green. It doesn't look cheap like some of the other cases that I ordered and then returned. The only thing that bothers me is that it picks up fingerprints very easily. My case has a lot of smudges on it now, and it's a hassle to constantly have to clean it. Even so, I would recommend this case."
4.0,Good Product
4.0,"Not the best, but good and comfortable."
4.0,This is awesome would be 5 stars if 4g lte capable and a bigger memory
4.0,I have had this cover for about 6 months and really like it - nice protection and fits perfectly.  I like the fact that it comes with a couple of legs to prop up - I saw a bad review of these but they are great.  The keyboard cover is useless - I just threw that away.
4.0,"I liked it, I just wish it would stand better, if you sit it up it sometimes it falls back"
4.0,Most of the time the cable works well for charging. Sometimes it does not work properly when using a 1A charging adapter instead of 2.1A charging adapter.
4.0,"Before buying this laptop, I had read some good reviews and some not so good, so I had mixed feelings.<br />Now I had it for a few days and I am very happy with it. Let me explain why.<br />First the price. It's a deal with this config, Intel I-5, DVD player, 8 Gb RAM, 1 Tb HDD.<br />For this price, of course I did not expect a SSD, but in a few months, if prices drop down, I may swap the HDD for a SSD.<br />I won't say anything about Windows 10 because, so far I don't see what is better than Windows 7 that I used with my former laptop. On the contrary, it takes some time to do correct settings if one wants to avoid all the spying which is activated by default.<br />The laptop seems reasonably happy with 8 Gb RAM. Windows 10 starts in less than 30', including a password.  I installed several of my favorite programs, including Microsoft Office and everything works fine.<br />Some people don't like the keyboard (rubber feeling) but for me it's not really a problem. Yes it reminds me of the first Atari computers in the early 80s. However, what I like is the numeric keyboard.<br />The screen is bright and OK to view movies. Beware, there is a tiny button to eject the DVD tray, so small that it is almost impossible to see it. To make it more convenient, I stuck a small white mark on it, and now it's okay.<br />Overall, this laptop is fast enough for most uses. And again for the price it is difficult to beat."
4.0,"Case is doable but is a bit more plastic-y then seems in picture. Seems durable, so far, so good! Thanks!"
4.0,"Pros:<br /> - Well made<br /> - Easy to use<br /> - Charges both my Macbook and any USB powered device (cell phone)<br /> - Decent charge (I get maybe 1 1/2 charges on my laptop)<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Heavier and bulkier than I had hoped<br /> - Too many cables, it takes three cables plus the charging box for full operation, which is too much to travel with. I usually only take the charger and cable that connects to recharge my laptop, which is fine for most cases."
4.0,"Good drive for the price for boosting older computers, but if it was actually for my own system I would have paid the extra for another Pro or M.2 AHCI drive, since I do notice a difference, it's not a big difference but it's still there."
4.0,Good stuff !!
4.0,"I would have preferred it some other color than white, but it served the purpose."
4.0,good product
4.0,enjoying it lots
4.0,Great value
4.0,Thank you
4.0,Good for the price I paid.
4.0,Worked great on single mode fiber across town.
4.0,Works great.
4.0,"good tester, had to get this for the company and i got more for reimbursement and i get to keep this"
4.0,Nice little mouse for the price. I bought a bunch of these for the office and most people like them compared to the wired mounse that PC's come with.
4.0,"Works just fine. Feels great to hold. Has a larger mouse wheel than most mice but I prefer a bigger wheel anyways. Adjustable DPI is a nice feature, as well as the back and forward buttons on the left side. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the LED's stay on all the time when it's plugged in, even if the computer is in sleep mode or completely off. I'm able to deal with it, but it is a bit of a disappointment."
4.0,USB's can easily be lost.  It would be nice if there were storage on the device but it serves its purpose and great price.
4.0,"First Kindle I received had 2 very annoying shadows along the bottom as some other users have also mentioned. Sent back and the new one has much less noticeable shadows. Tolerable. I wouldn't think after years of research, testing and manufacturing these devices should have these problem.<br /><br />My old Gen 1 Kindle Paperwhite's display is perfect. Wonder why I ordered a new one. Other than that it's a great device and I read more than ever."
4.0,love this as a spare
4.0,Packing was okay but it was safe from the outside also only got a 3 stand screws for the motherboard but at all was good
4.0,"a few annoyances but in general  does the job,maybe better apps"
4.0,I didn't think I would get used to it or like it because I like holding a book in my hands but  I love it! Works great. Much lighter than expected. Excellent color and clarity. Still learning the features.
4.0,I actually haven't gotten a chance to really use this device yet. I did hook it up and downloaded the apps for my devices and it seems like it is really easy to use.
4.0,Wish it was a little more padded but its not so bad. the extra pockets are perfect for the charger and the mouse.
4.0,Its a great product does just what it is intended for although I wish it fit just a bit more snugly to my laptop as it is a little flexible which I guess is good to keep it from snapping in half.
4.0,All of these WD products work great right out of the box.  I do wish it had a broader base...or base option...to set it up on carpet with it falling down.
4.0,Works perfectly with my Samsung Tab 4 and Samsung Tab S.
4.0,"Bought for an Asus C300 13&#34; laptop. It's a very close fit. Sturdily built by the looks and a good, heavy-duty zipper; but really just a touch too small. Think of trying to put on leggings one size too small -- you could do it, but it won't be easy and might not end well.<br /><br />Hard to make so many sized things, but this isn't a thick laptop (it's just a chromebook), and I'm not sure anything even a touch bigger would fit.<br /><br />I'm a little concerned that the zipper might damage the corners of the laptop. Not concerned enough to return it (which is probably all Amazon cares about), but it's worth noting."
4.0,It is exactly what i was looking for. Thanks
4.0,Worked out of the box. Need to download there file to center and use all of the screen. I am new to Pi.
4.0,great stylus
4.0,Have had this for a few weeks now and it's worked perfectly so far. For the price you can't beat it!
4.0,"I like this product, It's sturdy and looks really nice. The size is a perfect fit for my I pad 3. One very small short coming is, it only has one position when i tried to put it upright using the back support."
4.0,Doesn't have quite the airflow of my last couple of coolers. Now I'll wait and see how long it lasts.
4.0,It took me forever to break down and give up the &#34;paperback&#34; habit but I now love my Kindle!! It is so easy and having the dictionary feature right there is fabulous. I don't have to write down the word and look it up later.  The book I'm reading now is by a British author and so many of the words and phrases are particular to England.  There was only one word that was &#34;not found&#34; so far... I recommend it.
4.0,Arrived on time; First 2 have worked ok: Haven't used the remaining 8. My first flash drive (1 gig) cost over $100. I record my own music and messages for friends and relatives on these flash drives that they can keep or reuse for other purposes for less than the price of a nice greeting card.<br />Would be 5 stars if I had tested all 10. Time will tell the rest.. VERY GOOD DEAL
4.0,"Just what I expected for a small, on the go computer that is very easy to slip into a briefcase or suitcase. I consider this a low cost step up from a traditional tablet. Just a couple on cons. When reaching the keyboard, you need to play with it a little for it to be recognized. Also, about 50% of the security updates fail. I have owned it for about 3 days and will figure this out soon."
4.0,"I love my new laptop case! I placed my order on a Thurs and I got it on Sat morning. I have a 2015 Macbook Pro w/Retina display w/ a hardcover case and it fits into the bag perfectly! The bag is super cute and stylish and it is lined with soft material and padding on the inside for extra protection. I ordered the Blue case and it looks just like the picture but it smelled a little funny upon opening, but nothing to cry over. The smell became completely unnoticeable after a few minutes. I only give this bag 4 stars at the moment because I just received it so I cannot give an honest review of the longevity of the case, but so far I LOVE IT!!"
4.0,Sounds great..
4.0,Very nice color and quick shipping
4.0,Had the original kindle which tragically was dropped and screen cracked....Love the new kindle.
4.0,"I am enjoying this beach scene...it reminds me of home. However, the product would be event better if the light would shine through the stickers so one would be able to see the keys easier."
4.0,good product
4.0,"This sticker fits just over the whole apple on my 15&#34; macbook pro. While you have to be extreamly accurate to get it perfect, thhe end result is epic! Much better than most stickers. However..Im OCD so I pressed down very hard so there are no bubbles but if you look very close you can see how I pressed hard and the apple underneath - its outline is a tad visible..but from the normal looks your gonna get its epic!"
4.0,Great monitor!
4.0,"It fits perfectly and is much easier to use the tablet,"
4.0,Easy and quick set up. Decent quality for the low price.
4.0,"Perhaps I didn't know what I was getting into with a QODE keyboard, but it is difficult to switch back and forth with a QWERTY keyboard on a computer.  Overall, I have been satisfied, but I do feel like the case (at least at the binding) is pretty flimsy.  I am not sure it is going to last me more than 6-9, maybe 12 months, being constantly on the go.  Having to manually turn the keyboard on and off gets a little annoying when trying to use it in tablet mode.  A good product, but not a great one."
4.0,For a cheap mouse this works great.
4.0,I purchased this headset for my Livescribe Echo pen and love them. I'm using my livescribe pen and headset in an auditorium like classroom and they work great. Highly recommended!
4.0,"Outstanding value for money.  I wanted an Android tablet primarily as a means of browsing the Internet and watching streaming video, and in these respects, the M8 tablet does exactly what I want it to do.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Clear, bright high-resolution screen.<br />- Expandable storage (microSD), bluetooth (for external speakers), mini-HDMI.<br />- Lightweight with fairly good battery life.<br />- Smooth video playback.<br />- Good Internet browsing experience.<br />- Good build quality.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I hope Dragon Touch updates the M8 to Android 5 Lollipop, if the hardware can handle it.<br />- Android 4.4.2 runs smoothly, though some apps seem slightly laggy."
4.0,"Really good value, and works as advertised!"
4.0,"Plugged this dongle into my MacBook Pro and then the HDMI cord from the TV and it worked instantly.  However, I originally purchased this to be able to watch 4K videos on my TV.  This is not possible.  The computer n TV can both support the files, but the cable does not transmit at 4K.  I can't remember exactly, but it maxes out at 720 or 1080."
4.0,Works fine.
4.0,"I ordered this to speed up reprogramming BIOS on some flash parts.  I was using a Bus Pirate and it was taking about 25 minutes to reprogram each part.  With this each part programs in 2 minutes which is much better. The reason this only gets 3 stars is because the drivers included with it for 64bit windows aren't signed, this means you have to jump through a lot of hoops if you want to use this on a 64 bit machine.  I cheated since i have access to a real signing certificate through my work.  I had to modify the .inf file but eventually I was able to sign the drivers and get it working on my 64 bit Win 8.1 machine.  Update: Global Cyber Mart responded quickly to my request for signed 64 bit drivers and pointed out that the item says 32 bit.  So I've increased the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I've suggested they add a bullet item stating specifically that it is NOT supported for win 7/8/8.1 64 bit because I think the way they indicated 32 bit only support wasn't very obvious.  Pros: - Fast.  8MB part in 2 minutes - Cheap - Included software is easy to use.  Cons: - No signed 64 bit driver.  Beware Windows 64 bit users!"
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,Snapped into place easily and seems secure.  Haven't had it very long yet so I cannot comment on durability.
4.0,Great fan. Does a great job cooling my xbox360
4.0,Very happy with the speed web pages load. Screen quality good. Track pad requires a harder tough than others I've used.
4.0,"Worked as advertised. Connection is fast, even on a power strip. The included software is not Win10 compatible and it's required to reset the adapters to factory default. Download the latest version from the website, which works on Win10."
4.0,Great product!
4.0,"Bag of good quality, though a bit more than I expected"
4.0,Kind of a short battery life. Probably from the ads displayed on the screen.
4.0,"Is really cute,  it looks really big in the picture but is actually perfect size not to small but perfect to carry a book, water bottle and other things."
4.0,it extends the 1s and 0s just fine
4.0,Very nice equipment
4.0,"This paired well with my WD black hard drive. Plug and play, pretty much as easy as it gets. The unit does get a quite warm after extended use though"
4.0,Sounds pretty good.
4.0,Works...after almost a year I started to lose internet even with full signal from extender.  It turns out that there are more wifi signals in the neighborhood which caused interference.  A friend suggested changing the channel on the router.  Now I have no problems.  Most people use the default channel 1 and everyone was interfering each other.
4.0,"It Stand straight upright, keeps falling forward, should have been slightly slanted. Easy to carry."
4.0,The hole for headphones could be a little bigger but no other complaints.
4.0,Very quiet.<br />Moves the air nicely.
4.0,Very good
4.0,"The keyboard came and is missing the &#34;bluetooth connect&#34; button needed to pair it to my computer. I put batteries in it and the power light comes on, but my computer can never locate the keyboard.  *****edit****  The company contacted me and helped me get the keyboard working (thank you).   It's a good little keyboard for the price. About the size as an apple bluetooth keyboard, but a little cheaper feeling. No complaints though for the cost."
4.0,"I bought this for an old iPad2, which it fits perfectly. Here's what I like / dislike about the case...<br />PRO'S<br /> - As I said, its a good fit<br /> - It offers 2 separate incline positions<br /> - The magnet in the front cover wake the iPad without issue every time<br /> - I appreciate the look... clean, tidy, not too bulky<br />CON'S<br /> - It doesn't offer as much protection as I was hoping, especially for the corners and/or edges. If your kids will be using your iPad, this may not be the case for you.<br /> - To incline the iPad, the front cover of the case folds back and tucks into a little holder on the back cover. It tends to slide out of the holder at times.<br /> - The volume buttons are a little awkward to access when in the incline position.<br /><br />In summary, this is a decent product, with just a couple of small design flaws. Still it is well worth the small price tag, and at under $15, I would recommend to others."
4.0,"Love my keyboard protector. Took getting used to as silicone feels a little bit sticky compared to the name keyboard. But I like the protection is gives as I tend to be a bit messy and eat around my computer. My only gripe is that the keys on the top left slightly don't align to my Apple 13&#34; retina, so at night, it has a double outline, competing with the bottom light, but you can turn off the keyboard light and it should be fine."
4.0,First set had a bad stick of ram.  The return was easy and the second set works perfectly.  Can't beat it for the price!
4.0,Works well so far only had for 1 month.
4.0,works fine
4.0,great deal
4.0,So far so good. I've always liked WD drives.
4.0,"I have a macbook pro 15&#34; retina and it fits perfectly in here, even with a little room to spare, so if you have a case on your laptop, it will fit in there. the inside is a nice velvety fleece. I wish the pocket on the outside were a little bigger so I could fit my charger extension cord in along with my charger, but its still a good case."
4.0,Good optical drive. Didn't realized until after that it was Blu-Ray READ ONLY. My fault.
4.0,I've been purchasing Transcend storage solution products for some time now.  On a previous occasion one of their products failed.  Transcend replaced it with no hassles.  Transcend offers a good selection of products and provides good value for the money spent.
4.0,"For under $30, these are good headphones.  They are light and comfortable.  The velvet ear-cups are cooler then leatherette cushions in my opinion.<br /><br />Sound is okay, music is a bit muffled but games sound great on them.  The microphone works very well and I have had many say they hear me clearly.<br /><br />One other feature I like is the ear-cups swivel to conform to your ears.<br /><br />They are not the greatest, but as a back up pair to my broken Hyper Clouds, they work just fine."
4.0,great
4.0,good
4.0,"Nice looking, fits well and economical"
4.0,Wonderful for kids.
4.0,"Once I finally got the Range Extender properly configured and located in the right spot, it is providing exactly the performance for which I was looking.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the installation may not be as turnkey as most users would like. I am retired but am still fairly technical. I have a computer science degree, worked as a systems engineer for a computer company, worked in R&D for a computer company, and managed systems and software development for two companies. I usually have no difficulty getting a new device installed and properly configured.<br /><br />It simply would not work for me with the supplied installation CD. I went on the Linksys web site and downloaded the latest firmware (build 6) but going to 192.168.1.1 didn't take me to the Range Extender set up; it took me to my wireless router set up. I went into the Control Panel into the Network and Sharing Center and clicked on See Full Map. The map itself does not show the Range Extender but below the map is listed the devices discovered that could not be placed on the map. There I found the RE4000W. By right-clicking on that icon, you get the option to View Device Webpage. Clicking on that, I was indeed brought to the set up screen for the Range Extender. For me, its ip address was 192.168.1.247. This allowed me to log in (username blank, password admin), install the latest firmware and change the device's password to something other than the default admin for security purposes.<br /><br />I then downloaded the latest product installation program from the Linksys web site and ran it to install/configure the Range Extender. Note that it did not connect the first time, but the installation screen lists a number of possible reasons. One of the reasons is that you don't want your installation device (a laptop in my case) too close to the Range Extender itself. I was about five feet away. When I moved into another room, I was able to get a successful installation.<br /><br />Now the challenge was where to located the Range Extender &#34;permanently&#34; in the home. My wireless router is located in our basement, and I purchased this Range Extender to help my laptop connectivity from my home office on the main level of the house. Prior to the Range Extender installation, if I used my laptop in the kitchen which is directly above the wireless router location in the basement, I got a five bar connection and speedtest.net showed a 24 mbps download speed (I pay for a 20 mbps connection). If I moved my laptop to my home office, I got a two bar connection and speedtest.net showed that my download speed dropped to 1.8 mbps. My hope was that the Range Extender would allow me to get 24 mbps download speed in the home office.<br /><br />My first thought was to place the Range Extender in the kitchen directly above the wireless router location. That gave the Range Extender a five bar connection at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz. However, the laptop in my office only showed a three bar connection the the Range Extender and the download speed was only 2.6 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through six walls.) I then moved the Range Extender to the office and observed the reverse of the problem - a good connection from my laptop to the Range Extender and a poor connection from the Range Extender to the wireless router (no connectivity at 5.0 Ghz and two bars at 2.4 Ghz).<br /><br />I then changed the Range Extender location to be on a wall in the kitchen between the original location and the home office. It gave me connectivity at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz but the speed was almost the same: 2.8 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through four walls.) My &#34;last&#34; spot to try was putting the Range Extender in the wall outlet on our kitchen island. This location has a direct line of sight from the laptop to the Range Extender and is just 30 feet away. Voila!!! The connection from the Range Extender to the wireless routerhas five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation. However, I can well imagine that other home configurations may not be so forgiving. If I take my laptop to our master bedroom on the second floor of the house, my download speed drops to 20 mbps. If take it to the second floor bedroom on the opposite side of the house, the download speed drops to 2.0 mbps. Clearly, its range is significantly affected by the number of walls through which the signal must pass as well as what is in those walls.has five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation.

4.0,HAD TO ORSWE THREE COVERS UNTIL I FOUND ONE THAT FIT
4.0,Snapped into place easily and seems secure.  Haven't had it very long yet so I cannot comment on durability.
4.0,"Great overall, just doesn't go on perfectly, no matter how hard you try, there's always something wrong (bubble, crease, etc.)"
4.0,for the money i like it .
4.0,"This case is very sturdy BUT it's difficult to put on and once it's on, the buttons are extremely hard to push. My 3 and 5 year olds have to bring us their tablet every time they want to adjust the volume. We own 2 of these and I do feel like our tablets are very well protected, it's just the minor annoyance with the buttons that gets a little frustrating. I do recommend this product to other buyers."
4.0,"It is small - not much bigger than my iPhone 6. I wasn't sure if I would like the smaller screen. ( I thought I had ordered the 7&#34; model.) It turns out I love the compact size. It fits into a small purse and traveled well. The case I ordered is working out well. I have had this Kindle for only two weeks. One draw back is that it does not seem to hold a charge as well as my Kindle Fire did, but so far it has not been a problem."
4.0,"Great tablet for the average use. Nothing too special, its just right for the price. One major Con though is the screen angle, if you are not looking directly at the screen you'll just see a blur."
4.0,"I wish it &#34;connected&#34; with my iPad a bit better (I don't know the word for it, but it seems to not work nearly as well as my finger), but overall ok."
4.0,"Looks good, seems to work well--fast transfer of data--although I've already encountered one type of USB device (micro disk adapter) that it refuses to recognize. I have to that USB directly into the computer to access the disk. I'm hoping this is not a progressive problem and that over time I discover more devices that won't function on it. Fingers crossed."
4.0,"I have an older Kindle fire & recieved the Paperwhite as a gift. The paper white is a perfect size and handy for reading books you already purchased. Shopping for titles is a little more difficult because the covers dont render very well in black and white.<br />Pages are easy to read,  the blacklight adjustment is easy to use for any lighting situation.<br />If the Paperwhite is going to be your only e-reader keep in mind that shopping is easier thru a tablet, laptop or desktop."
4.0,"Battery came charged, fit and worked great! I'm satisfied. Thank you!"
4.0,"The physical trackball using the thumb is my favorite way to mouse all day, everyday, without any wrist pain. I have used different Logitech trackball models over the last 10+ years, and was sad that the USB corded version of the model is more expensive than the wireless model.  The Logitech wireless unifying drivers to pair the USB receiver with the mouse/keyboard has been Windows primarily, so I wasn't sure devices owned by me, would be used for the same long life time, like the corded versions I've owned and used.  If you don't have access to a Windows machine to set these devices, it is just easier to steer clear of them.  It appears that Logitech is making progress on porting the setup software to other platforms, but it does not appear to be without risks.  So be aware.<br /><br />At first, the trackball feels a touch sluggish until it is used a few days, and then it either break-in, or your body calibrates itself to the touch and that sensation is gone. I have been using two of these, one at home, and one at work for a solid year, and I am very pleased with this version of the trackball.  I have owned at least 4 others over the years, but this is my favorite of the lot so far.  I'm on the same set of batteries!<br /><br />My wrist thank me everyday that I enjoy using computers with these devices.  I'm considering purchasing a couple as spares, because I'm not sure that they won't be phased out over some other input method in the future, that I won't lime as well.  I usually try and repair/replace switches in these instead of buying new ones, so I get better than average long life.<br /><br />I like the Logitech brand, and get reasonable satisfaction from using their products as long as my expectations are in check."
4.0,PROS: This HDD works right out of the box and space is allocated properly for XBOX 360 format. Came in one piece and packaging was pristine.<br /><br />CONS: The only issue with the drive I received was that the partition for Emulating/Playing Original Xbox games was not present. The only way to get a drive with this partition pre-instaled is to buy an expensive Microsoft drive. There is an easy fix if you have time and some technical know-how.<br />-- Here's a link for the fix:<br />http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/xbox-360-content/apps-pc/4897-xbox-360-partition-2-download-xbox-1-emulator.html
4.0,"Worked as expected,  easy to install and it works."
4.0,"the Pi is fantastic, I recommend it to anyone interested in things of that sort. The case functions. I'm sure there are better cases out there. The reason I gave 4 stars not 5, is the WI-FI dongle doesn;t work that well. I know its not going to be as powerful as my laptop or phone but sometimes it will loose signal 2 feet from my router. There are better ones available, but considering the price for the whole package it's not that big of a deal."
4.0,"Easy to configure, but keeps dropping the wifi signal. Called Apple, and their support was good, but still dropping the wifi signal on my iphone and my ipad! Tried computer set up instead of my iphone, and it seemed to work better."
4.0,Great product.
4.0,"I debated between 3 and 4 stars because on one hand this is a far from perfect tablet, but on the other hand we only paid $60! We bought this for our 3.5 year old daughter and we're mostly happy with it.<br /><br />Likes:<br />Super kid friendly hardware, durable, and great size for little hands<br />Zoodles app is okay (see dislikes) it is very easy for a kid to learn, my daughter had it down in less than 10 minutes<br />Lots of apps available for kids, many of them free<br />My daughter loves the recorded story books, it comes with one for free and it's pretty cheap to buy more<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />The biggest one is Zoodles will just stop working sometimes dumping my daughter out into unmonitored, unfiltered, tablet land.<br />I can't get Netflix to work within the Zoodles app (if anyone knows what I'm doing wrong I love to hear!)<br />The power cord is really finicky there have been many times we thought we had it plugged in just to find it wasn't and the tablet was dead the next day.<br />I wish instead of an app I could create a kid account on the computer so I wouldn't have issue one.<br /><br />All in all, it was worth the $60. I recommend getting the carrying case that Amazon recommends with it as well for safe travel."
4.0,As advertised.
4.0,I use it with 2007 Max Mini Server and it works fine but Mac mini doesn't have USB 3 but only USB 2 and the monitor's screen sometimes responds slow. Brightness is pretty good.<br />I want to give it 4 stars.
4.0,"I upgraded from a 600 series high end card.  Once the drivers were updated, the card worked just fine."
4.0,"I could have loved this product if it was a little bigger. Agree with most of the other reviews, it is very tight for a 13.3 Lenovo Yoga Pro, so make sure to choose one bigger size"
4.0,I like this product. I use it on an aquarium and it cools the water 5 degrees. It's silent too.
4.0,Works well
4.0,"Although the price is notably better than the Apple store product, the capacity to hold its charge is less than the Apple battery.  However, if you primarily use the laptop plugged in, or have frequent access to the plug, this is a great option.  Furthermore, installation was very easy with the supplied screwdrivers."
4.0,Very good
4.0,very good
4.0,"a wee bit over priced, although some good stuff. good learning experience. most certainly recommended for father/son time"
4.0,"Loved the tablet, I had another brand and I really like this one so much better...the problem is, I haven't been able to use it much at all...I can't get the pen to hold the charge for more than maybe 20 minutes.  And I am not even using it that long.  I charged it when I got it and didn't touch it for the day, I was busy doing other things.  I thought having the rechargeable pen would be much better than the battery one I had with my other set, but if it doesn't hold a charge then I am thinking if I made the wrong decision.  Is this typical for this pad/pen?"
4.0,"Stylish product with a sleek design. RGB in the Corsair logo can be changed to basically any color you want, can pulse or change color based on temperature, yet isn't bright enough to overpower the rest of the case. CorsairLink software (DL from the website) is relatively simple to use. From my most recent experiences with it, it seems to be much more stable than when it was first released (individual user experiences may vary). Tubes are made of a very thick rubber. The length of the tubes and stiffness made the installation a bit difficult. I was seriously afraid I was going to break the plastic on the impeller housing during installation. The H100i has far exceeded my expectation in cooling efficiently. If you looking for liquid cooling system look no further. I'd say it's hands down worth every penny."
4.0,This was just the part I needed I was amazed how Amazon made it so easy to find this part very pleased.
4.0,I liked it but it was too big for the space.  Effortless return.
4.0,"Great,except I bent the white usb thingey,and it won't work now.  It charged at a fantastic rate."
4.0,The Yellow is a little darker in person than it is in the picture

4.0,"This generation has pros and cons from the generation of the E-ink Kindle that I had.  I hang onto my technology as long as possible, if it is working for me.  The pros are 1) it is smaller in overall size and therefore lighter; 2) the &#34;light&#34; is internal and you no longer have an extra purchase for a light in a case and 3) the screen is a touch screen and there is no keyboard.  Some of the pros turn into cons for me.  1) The internal &#34;light&#34; acts more like a contrast mechanism and seems to cause more eye strain for me than the E-ink with the external light source; 2) The touch screen is annoying at times. When I want to wipe away a hair or piece of dirt that fell onto my screen, I accidentally turn the page; 3) a power adapter has to be purchased separately if you want to charge from an outlet.  This came with the purchase of the E-ink Kindle and luckily it works with this generation as well. 4) You have to now pay extra to get the Whispernet (free 3G) which I did not have to do with my original Kindle.  I travel and find this a nice feature since this is more readily available to me than wi-fi and therefore easier for me to download or order another book."
4.0,Great tablet but speakers are very quiet and not Loud
4.0,I have no problem with the refurbished Kindle so far but just received it last week.
4.0,Works well however it seems to come out of the socket very easily so if bumped it goes flying.  Luckily I am using it as a power hub sitting in my basement to jacks that I installed in my kitchen.
4.0,Needed this to recover some files for old 1.44MB floppies and does the job.  Nothing much to expect since this is not going to be of daily use.
4.0,The only reason not 5 stars is I'v not used the other connectors yet. GREAT!!!!!!
4.0,"I love it. The item starts up very quickly and can handle multitasking very well. It runs quiet overall and runs cool from the bottom. I haven't had a hot lap yet with a 3 hour use of web browsing and photo editing. I installed windows 10 immediately upon starting up the laptop for the first time. Everything installed smooth and runs smooth. From my understanding this is not the lightest laptop nor the heaviest. But its still very comfortable to carry around and have on your lap. I will admit that the exterior laptop quality of material used is not the best or even close. The keyboard does have flex in it, and plastic comes to mind for everything but the hardware. However I understand that for this price range of $575.00, I was more interested in having the 8 GB ram, 1 TB of hard drive space using an Intel I7 processor. I use my laptop for home use and for when I go on vacation for photo upload use. So this review is for the average user. The screen resolution is not the best. However I am fine with it and I am not a screen pixel buff. The screen resolution is identical to my old 2007 acer laptop which I never thought had a bad picture. I hope this laptop will give me another 8 years of solid use. My old acer is still running strong with the original battery but it was time I upgraded to 8GB of Ram which my old one which had 2 GB of ram. Wow what a difference. So if you are looking for laptop that will handle just about every use not including heavy gameplay, I recommend this laptop. I was willing to give up build quality for hardware specs. So using the laptop the past week I am very happy with my purchase. I will just have to be very careful not ever drop the thing."
4.0,"Great value, I used this to replace a horrible old Dell mouse I had at work.  This one fits my hand well, I like the additional weight as well.  The action is smooth and fast and the buttons and wheel have good response and feedback."
4.0,Works as advertised.
4.0,"Works perfectly. Not the best hand fit, but what do you expect for the price?"
4.0,Had some bubbles but a good product overall.
4.0,What I was expecting
4.0,kind of annoying if your computer sits to your right instead of left as the cord might tangle or have to be strewn across. The length of the cord is a good thing though. The quality of the headset sounds good to me as I use them mostly for music and they deliver.  I believe this was a good buy for the price.
4.0,A+ purchase...can't beat the price!
4.0,Love it.  Have been using it for a few weeks now and seems to be very durable.  Protects IPad very well.  Good quality
4.0,"I was able to repair one charger twice. My boys immediately broke the first attempt, so I believe these cable are not as sturdy as the originals.  If you go this route buy a nice solder iron.  The one I have was not able to get hot enough to unsolder one the spot so I had to solder the wires together.  There good videos on how to do this which is good for getting into the case.  I used two pair of pliers back-to-back to pry the case open.  The other charger was too difficult.  I would have had to unsolder a bunch extraneous parts to get at it.  My novice skills were not up to the task."
4.0,This is an okay laptop screen guard. I was able to put it on nicely so I don't have any complaints. It's thickness is just right.
4.0,"Instructions are not clear but after fiddling around with it for half the day, I finally got it to work. (I was recording from a VHS recorder to my PC) This after a dozen unsuccessful email exchanges with customer support. The order in which you load the software and connect the adapter is key. Once I got it running it worked perfectly."
4.0,"Great, excellent product as far as Dell PCs go... too bad I can't say the same about Windows 10 (my Wi Fi connection has been woefully unstable since I upgraded from Windows 8.1)"
4.0,it worked
4.0,"I've used a lot of different brands over the many years of gaming, and this mouse is a very solid choice. I have larger hands and I love the feel of this mouse, I do however like Logitech's ergo feel better. This will be my 3rd Deathadder over the many years, and this one is on par with the older models. Better laser and the click feels more like a mechanical keyboard to me.. but maybe thats because its brand new and it's been awhile since I've used the older Deathadders. Razer software is pretty good, but there are a couple bugs when syncing with Blackwidow Chroma or turning off the lights when you shut the computer off. Low natural acceleration makes it great for precision.<br /><br />All in all, I find it to be one of the best FPS mice out there. Great all around mouse too, and fair competitive pricing for gaming mice."
4.0,Excellent
4.0,"I really love this device! I love that I can access my amazon account on the kindle to view my wish list and also purchase books right from my device. My only complaint is sometimes when I turn a page or am browsing through amazon for a new book, the previous screen is &#34;burned in&#34; to where I have to reload the page again. Other than that this is a great product and I am very happy with my purchase."
4.0,I returned this not because there was anything wrong with it but because it was not the 1515+.  I though the 1515 and 1515+ were identical except for some processing specs but only the 1515+ can run the Plex app on the sever directly.  So I sent this one back after 24 hours and realizing my mistake and purchased the 1515+ which I am super happy with.  If you have no plans on running the Plex app then by all means this is a great piece of equipment.
4.0,Nice.
4.0,Does the job for me.
4.0,Delivered and worked
4.0,"I bought two, one works perfectly, adding 4 extra SATA on my home NAS; one was DOA but I got refund immediately."
4.0,Quick way to hook up computer output from laptop to Toslink input on audio receiver. Laptop does Netflix loads a lot faster on laptop than budget blu-ray dvd players
4.0,"This is the second Griffin Survivor case for the iPad I use. Qualify is outstanding. It looks good to show up with a camouflaged case when all the other cases at the tablet are uniformly black. (My iPhone is kept in a camouflage/hunter orange Otterbook case with ReatTree camo. The Survivor on the iPad has Mossy Oak camo.)<br /><br />I have dropped this iPad on carpeted surfaces from about five feet high. On concrete from about 4 feet. I keep all my nav charts, etc, on the iPad. Can't say enough about these cases.<br /><br />Except, maybe, that they could have molded the rubber part that goes over the shell in dark green to make it look &#34;cooler.&#34;"
4.0,Fast delivery and product was just as described. I feel does a good job at providing protection for my Chromebook when I travel.
4.0,It is bigger than I expected but works well and as advertised.
4.0,It fits perfectly and my mac looks prettier.
4.0,"The Sabrent SATA external Harddrive case has met my expectations completely. It is perfectly suited, if you need to reuse your old hard drives from your old computers and can be used as a cheap backup alternative."
4.0,"This is an honest review of a bag I'm quite happy with so far. The quality, look, and feel overall have exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The quality of the leather is firm and strong - perfect for carrying heavy items and maintaining its structure.<br />The smell is genuine leather - love it.<br />The design - very attractive and unisex, yet secure. Nobody's getting into this thing without having to work and catch your attention lol.<br />The size - I can fit EVERYTHING into this bag. As a career woman, this huge. Nothing worse than toting 3-4 bags to work everyday on the bus or train during rush hour!<br /><br />Now for what I don't like:<br />I wasn't crazy about the dry film I had to wipe off with a moist rag once received. However, given the price and country of origin, I am understanding of the manufacturing process and didn't find this to be too much of a bother.<br />The leather was not preconditioned - if you want it to have a bit of sheen, you'll want to have the mink oil, etc., handy. I'm not fond of my leather looking dry.<br />The buckles and strap connections make me slightly nervous. However, the stitching, bolts, and reinforcements in the high stress areas do give me some comfort. Still, I probably wouldn't use this bag to carry anything ridiculously heavy on a daily basis. I will be carrying a lightweight laptop, iPad, and toiletry bag, and it seems to accommodate like a true champ.<br /><br />Overall, I adore this bag! It's exactly what I was looking for and looks as though I paid 5x the amount for it, especially after the conditioning. As a matter of fact, a bag I saw for around $450 wasn't nearly as cute. I plan to give this one a real go and will report back in a few months after a bit of wear and tear."
4.0,A little bulky but does what it is supposed to do.
4.0,Good tablet for the price.
4.0,Good quality material
4.0,"I used it to upsize several SATA bootable drives. In one example I went from a 160G HD to 240G SSD, and this was done by pulling the original HD from the netbook and plugging it into the standalone box along with the inbound SSD, then pressing the button for 3-seconds to start. The box does come with a USB cable, but it is needed for the initial step. It is used for mounting one or both drives into the directory of a host computer, where one can view and use them just like any other USB drive.  As discussed by others, the new drive gets partitioned as the old one was, so I rounded up a command-line utility (DiskPart included in WindowsXP/7/etc) and extend the partition out. Note that this utility and others will not allow you to change a partition on a currently active boot drive. Therefore I wouldn't want to immediately install the new drive back into my one-slot machine. Instead the USB cable is used to mount the drive onto a bootable machine, possibly this machine with the old drive reinstalled, then extend the partition. Now we are finally ready to swap in the new larger drive permanently.  Can the USB cable be used to clone the old drive before taking it out? Yes, however two issues. First, is that if your machine's USB port is only 2.0, then its going to take awhile. For instance, I've got that 500G clone-over-2.0 job going right now that is calculated to last 9 hours. For comparison, doing this using the stand-alone configuration would be perhaps 30 minutes tops. The second issue is that this KingWin product did not come with any host application software for doing this over-USB maneuver. Instead I went and pulled a (free) cloning app off the internet. However this was actually necessary for still another reason.  Although the KingWin is great at upsizing drives, a very common need, it refuses to go the other direction. In my other example, I cloned a 500G drive over to a fresh 1T drive. Initially then, the 1T drive has the same 500G partition as the original. Now keep the 500G partition, and wipe/format the original 500G drive, and then try the clone back the reverse direction. The red light on the smaller target goes out and all four blue lights flash unendingly, which I guess (because documentation is minimal) means that we are not proceeding any further. Hence the need for (free) cloning software that can in fact yank a 500G partition off a 1T drive and send it over to a 500G drive. So long as neither the source drive nor the destination are the drive your machine has booted off of. Got it?"
4.0,"Bluetooth hooked easily enough. Leather case doesn't look cheap. Keys are silicone which give a nice feel to them, not slippery.<br />Only negative thing would be there are 2 shift keys side by side which doesn't make much sense to me.<br />The 4th and 5th picture most be of a different model keyboard and case because mine does not look like that."
4.0,"I've had this computer for a bit more than a month, and it's done a great job for the most part. People seem to complain about Windows 8.1, but I actually like it with a touchscreen computer. In short, here's my impression:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fast processor: the computer performs well when doing CPU-heavy tasks.<br />- Lovely screen: Photos and videos look really nice on this machine, the touchscreen is responsive and fun to use.<br />- Keyboard: I really like the feel of the keyboard, it has smooth press-action while feeling solid and precise.<br />- USB 3.0: The processor and USB3 ports make for fast file transfers to external drives.<br />- Size: I think the size and weight of this laptop are ideal for traveling. It's thin and light, making it very comfortable to use while out and about.<br />- Noise: Compared to my old laptop, this thing produces minimal noise. It doesn't get hot, therefor is comfortable to use on your lap.<br />- Fast start/shut down: This laptop turns on from being all the way shut off quickly, a huge improvement over my old Win7 laptop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Touchpad: Something odd happens with the touchpad; even if I disable it, it comes back on. This makes typing annoying at times since if I accidentally swipe the pad it moves my cursor potentially messing with what I'm working on. There's no way to disable the driver for the touchpad either. I've tried everything! Other than that, it's a good touchpad, I'm simply irritated I can't turn it off.<br />- Power cord: The one it comes with is a bit shorter than I like, so I had to buy an extension.<br />- Battery: Depends on what your standards for battery life are, I get on average 4-5 hours out of a full charge if I'm doing a typical workload (1-2 browses open with many tabs, spreadsheets, iTunes, FileExplorer, Adobe software, etc). I suppose this really isn't that bad, but then again compared to a Mac this may not be enough for some people (i.e. 8-9 hours with a MacBook Pro, however it's twice the price).<br />- Shift key: Lastly, and perhaps a little nit-picky, the right shift key is smaller than the left one so it's taken some practice to not hit the wrong key.<br />-I have found NO WAY to disable the automatic screen dimming feature, it's driving me nuts. I've tried several different methods to turn it off, even editing the registry, but nothing worked."
4.0,This s*** work good
4.0,Worked well.
4.0,Works & fast service..no complaints here
4.0,Excellent and affordable
4.0,The stylus brook quickly. The tablet works good but it is hard to find a good keyboard and case for it that is not too expensive
4.0,as described
4.0,"I bought these for my son and uses them all the time, so I have to believe he likes them"
4.0,It gets the job done
4.0,"Basic model , light and efficient"
4.0,It's a charger. It charges. There you go.
4.0,"I purchased this model for $50 rather than the $120 that it originally retailed for. I think had the price been higher my review would be lower.  First off this is a very light tablet. I would be very concerned if I dropped it, the plastic case seems like it would shatter instantly upon impact. This can be a bonus as its small enough to fit in my back pocket without me noticing it, but on the other hand if I sat down with it still in my pocket I'm certain I'd break it. Just keep in mind that it is a very light (and presumably flimsy) tablet. This is exactly what you'd expect for a $50 tablet, however.  The screen does not perform well outdoors. Even at maximum brightness you can't see anything on the screen when outdoors. To me this is not a problem since it doesn't have any type of cell connection so I planned to use it almost exclusively indoors. Just make sure you don't have any sources of light shining directly on the screen.  The unit comes with a pretty good processor (for the price) but with only 512mb of RAM. This is the only truly negative factor with the tablet; you really have to make sure as few processes as possible are running in the background otherwise you will have some serious stability issues. A few apps crashed as I was downloading multiple updates. Had this been a more expensive tablet I might want to expect a little more.  As I said in the beginning its a pretty good tablet for the price. The one thing I would say is don't' expect to be able to play many games. A few games work but the low RAM will prevent several games from even booting up.  As far as the software itself, there is one issue that led me to return the tablet eventually. For some reason I was unable to update several Google apps on the tablet, including the &#34;Google App for Android&#34; app. This became a problem as the google search function was completely broken. I could search the web with Chrome but not with the Google App. Every time I attempted to update the app in the Google Play Store I received an error saying that the package was not properly signed and that I needed to uninstall and re-install the app. However, the Google App cannot be uninstalled on this device (this is not true on all Android devices and must presumably be particular to the install of Android 4.4 that NueTab puts on these tablets). I contacted NeuTab's customer support about this issue but received zero response. Had this been from a major manufacturer (Dell or Samsung, for example) I would probably give this fewer stars, but given the price I kind of expected as much. After much experimentation the only option left to me was to root the device and install a fresh version of Kitkat.  In the end I returned the tablet because if I'm going to be rooting a tablet I'd rather spend the same amount of money for a used tablet with higher system specifications, which I did.  In all, it was a decent tablet for the money, and I only returned the tablet for the reason above. Instead I ordered a used Dell Venue 7 tablet which has more storage and higher RAM (although sadly a slower processor) than this model, but is used.  If you're looking for a cheap tablet that will run email (although sadly not Google Inbox, for some reason) and web browsing, a few word processing applications and some games for $50 or less than I would recommend this tablet (presuming they fix the issue with the Google Search function). Just keep in mind that, due to its low price, you get what you pay for."
4.0,32 Gigs is just right for a smartphone.
4.0,"Bought this to reduce boot time on a secondary machine connected to our main TV.  Boots Windows 8 in less than 18 seconds, and is awesome for Minecraft play."
4.0,So far so good. Seems since it's an older mother board its limited on video cards
4.0,Works even better than I expected. The range increase from my router is fantastic. I can use my portable devices all over my large house and even outside on the patio.
4.0,"Didn't trust at first because of the looks and reviews containing only a few words. Well there's not much to say. It works like a charm. Sometimes the brick heats up too much, but OEM charger does that too, just not as much and not as quickly."
4.0,Nice
4.0,"This case is beautiful and easy to put on! The apple logo cutout is a tiny bit too far to one side, but hardly noticeable. Very happy with this!"
4.0,"This little drive is great for storing files so I can access them which ever computer I'm using at the time. I switch from one computer to the other because of chronic pain, and got tired to not having the file I wanted to work on right then where I was (and I always forget to carry the USB sticks from one computer to the other). This has cured that problem.<br /><br />I had no problem getting it to work on the laptop & desktop (both PCs), but had trouble with my iPad. I have an old iPad II and the driver I found for it at the App Store is apparently an older one or something because the user manual shows features my drive does not have, and while I can access files *from* the iPad, I cannot move any files from the iPad on to the drive so I can access them on the PCs. Hopefully another driver shows up so I can have full access to everything. If it would do that, I would give it five stars!"
4.0,I bought these for my wife's computer.  She is Russian and it helps her when she types using some of the Russian language programs on her computer.  I had purchased these before for an older computer and she used it for a couple of years without any of these coming off or wearing out.  But when we replaced it she now has a new wireless keyboard.  They show up nice on black keys; they come in other colors for gray or light keys.  A nice item that makes life better for the wife; and you know that helps!
4.0,Works
4.0,"Works great as intended. Unfortunately, we purchased this for the Surface Pro 3. The USB port on the Surface does not put out enough power for this product to operate. Very handy to use otherwise. Easy transport, very light."
4.0,okay for the price  and size camera sucks though and it don't stay charged long
4.0,"Bought this PC with all the excitement of 10 year old me that couldn't afford this a long time ago. But since it got here, there was some issues that came up:<br /><br />1. PC delivery was late. At least 2 weeks late. When we called Amazon to check on the status, Amazon decided that they would just send a replacement and call the previous a loss. Strange.<br /><br />2: The machine RESTARTS periodically. What do I mean by that? As soon I got the PC I installed StarCraft 2, League of Legends and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The machine handles League of Legends just fine. But when I started playing either Deus Ex or SC2, the PC would restart without warning. It happened a several times, enough for me to chat with Acer reps but they blamed it all on the system requirements of the games. I told them the PC surpasses the requirements and they did nothing else to help. To this day, I haven't played Deus Ex. Some owners of this PC blames it on the PSU saying Acer could've supplied a higher Watt PSU but thats all I can say about that.<br /><br />Other than that, I would give this PC a 4/5 since its a lot better than my old laptop. I would recommended skipping this PC altogether (even though the price tag is nice) and save up for another $500-1000 machine."
4.0,"This product is great, it is very small and very easy to get missed placed"
4.0,"The case fits perfectly as well as the keyboard cover. The cover came with some faint marks on it that I can't seem to get off, but other than that it's great!"
4.0,Great laptop couldn't be happier
4.0,Great product for the value.  Wanted  a tablet to stream video throughout the house and in outside spaces.  This fits the bill.  Screen size is acceptable and sound is fine.  Like that 2 charger options were provided.
4.0,Great item.
4.0,Ok - but wan't the best choice for the build so I returned it.  There's nothing wrong with the memory.  It was just going to be a lower end chipset in a high heat environment and I thought better of the choice.
4.0,So far so good. Still getting used to chrome operating system.
4.0,"Easy set up, like it. It works and is easy to use with multiple machines due to one small USB connector."
4.0,Satisfied with items.
4.0,Good price.
4.0,There are pockets to keep an adapter.
4.0,"Works quite well, a little hard to set up."
4.0,"As pictured, have not tried to apply yet. Will let everyone know how they look when I do"
4.0,Have only used one so far and it performs exactly as I would expect.
4.0,Nice size. Still learning how to use it all. 😣but already got a scratch on the screen.
4.0,It fits the Fire HD7 as advertised.
4.0,"Great cpu cooler, bit of a pain to install"
4.0,I was looking for some inexpensive drives for some units I was refurbing..  these filled the bill nicely
4.0,"I got the GM1213A as my first gaming desktop and I've been very pleased with the purchase. The specs are good for the cost, and there is plenty of room to upgrade the computer. I have recently decided to try to upgrade the computer, specifically the graphics card. The site shows it coming with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 2GB card, but apparently it shipped with a 740. Apart from that, I was also missing the two fans on the left hand pane when the computer arrived. I have spoken to Cybertron about this issue, and their tech support staff member DJ was extremely helpful with the process of getting me the fans, and talking me through the options of new graphics cards. Thanks to his support, I decided to give this computer a 4/5 instead of a 3/5, and think Cybertron should make sure that are marking the product correctly on Amazon to avoid this in the future."
4.0,Cord a little shorter than original. Works fine.
4.0,Keeps my little girl happy and it's just right for her. She loves the color and that it's not to big or to small for her.
4.0,received as posted. good service. product works fine. no complaints.
4.0,"Besides some of the spots not matching up to the keyboard, it is a pretty good cover. It is a little hard to type with but I'm once you get used to it, it should be fine"
4.0,"Do some research before buying this and assuming it will work with your printer. Worked with my HP, did not work with my mother-in-law's Dell."
4.0,"Good product. Easy installation. Excellent technical support provided 24/7, by qualified technicians.  This is a good router."
4.0,"Product was easy to put on, fits perfectly and performs as intended"
4.0,"I did not know it was the &#34;OLD MODEL&#34; when I purchased it. I had a hard time getting it to work when first installed and still get some kind of error message when I  open Seagate Dashboard software. The explanation between back up times, daily monthly and continuous does not exist. I tried &#34;weekly&#34; and on the back up it took just short of 3 hours. I then change to &#34;Continuously&#34;. Now I hope everything is working properly."
4.0,Excellent price and quality by RAZER again!
4.0,Excellent. Product was as expected.
4.0,Very nice fit and really helps with glare. Easy to apply
4.0,just what I needed!
4.0,My only real complaint is that it's a touch smaller than I would like; it's not quite big enough to fit standard sized paper documents; but suitable for letters.
4.0,ok
4.0,Perfect for laptop without cd/dvd drive.
4.0,"Works fine to read, write, and boot from SD card. SD card will most likely be bottleneck not this adapter."
4.0,The M1210 doesn't see this unit as  producing sufficient power to charge the batter and produces a bios message indicating a 65W Dell charger is needed - but you can ignore the message and it works fine though it doesn't show that it is charging the batter (which I don't use anyway).
4.0,"Ordered this laptop for college and I haven't had many problems. Seems durable so far and is a decent very cheap computer.<br />Pros:<br />Durable. I feel like I could throw it around a little bit and it would last.<br />Cheap. I bout this for about 250 and it's definitely well worth the money. This is very comparable to an HP that is way over the 250 mark.<br />Size. This is the perfect size for me. Not too big to carry, but also is perfect for movie watching.<br />Weight. Very lightweight for this decent sized computer.<br />Cons:<br />Speakers aren't that great. Not loud at all, but easily fixed with some plug in 20 dollar speakers.<br />Not touch screen. This is a pro for many, and I don't mind it too much. I'm so used to everything being touch screen, and sometimes start clicking the screen.<br />Windows 8. Free upgrade so this isn't a huge problem<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product for a great price."
4.0,"Does what it says on the box! Small and light, easy to carry around.  Would be nice if the tail cable folded over a bit more, but very useful. Linux users may need to check they have the right kernel module, but it does work with Linux."
4.0,okey
4.0,This works great and has kept the screen free of scuffs and scratches.
4.0,Easy use....self explanatory.
4.0,Very usefull and handy SD Card Storage.
4.0,Great case; fast shipping; front pocket zipper broke easily
4.0,"Easy to setup, short range at least at my house"
4.0,"We actually have several of these cases made by different manufacturers.  This one is designed like the others and the construction is comparable but, for $11 and change, the price is better.  There is not a lot of storage provided for the game cartridges if you prefer to store them separate from one another (not just tossed all together in a zipper compartment) so we purchase these:[[ASIN:B004K6LQAS Nintendo 3DS Game Card Case 24 - Black]] to use with the bag."
4.0,Works well
4.0,Good quality. Strong zipper. Plush inner lining...  but  a wee bit too big for my 13.3 Macbook pro. I will keep in though. Good protection for my laptop
4.0,arrived as promised. Nice product
4.0,I like it. I had to trim a bit of leather in order to access a button
4.0,so good
4.0,Exactly as advertised
4.0,decent product at this price.
4.0,"works exactly as promised. No way to recall a drawing though, which is irritating (you get them synched to your phone and from there to other apps, but can't review or edit your work on the device. :("
4.0,Good motherboard
4.0,Does the job
4.0,Good item
4.0,"Received product in timely manner.  Had a little operator problem installing the program but this company has excellent technical support and made the installation very easy. The Satechi Bluetooth adapter works great with speaker system.  Have other equipment to use it with and have not tried that yet.  So far, am very pleased."
4.0,Solid case and keyboard sleeve. Fit my Mac Pro perfectly. Disappointed with plastic screen cover. I had difficulty making the sheet stick. I ended up trashing it.
4.0,"Nice mouse pad, does the job well I just wish the memory foam was a tad firmer."
4.0,"This is ok, the keys don't light up. you have to unhook it turns into 2 pieces."
4.0,I found this to be a interesting choice in the world of electronic thingies. At 2.5&#34; it is bigger then a 2&#34; yet smaller then a 3&#34;. It has 512GB which is more then the 511GB model but less then the 513GB model. It is the 850 Pro which is better then the 850 Semi-Pro. I feel the little red accent on the front of this adds a nice touch of color. I did the drop test on this dropping it on my pillow from 4.35 inches and it did no damage at all showing some nice quality. Would of been 5 stars if there were a little more of the red highlights on the front like a red star or a red smile face. Thank you very very much for reading my review boys and girls.
4.0,"Yeh, these look pretty sharp, but I am SURE there are going to be some situations where that armor-plating is going to get in the way.  It didn't happen to me, but it might happen to you."
4.0,"Writing this review on behalf of my girlfriend since she bought it for me.<br /><br />I say 4/5 just due to not having Windows 10 compatibilty but I'm sure it will be here soon...Great astehtics, feel, and clicking. Amazing price of all."
4.0,Works well
4.0,Good for tbe price. Battery lasts 1.5 hours.
4.0,it's an SD card... what can you say
4.0,"Attractive case with a nice feel to it. Fits my Kindle perfectly.<br />The stand is nice, but I wish it had a way to view in portrait mode."
4.0,"Awesome Case!!<br /><br />Fits my MacBook Pro 13&#34; Retina Display laptop perfectly. Leaves all ports accessible.<br />My Apple logo glows through the protector. Has holes in bottom to allow laptop to breathe and prevent overheating.<br /><br />The bottom feet of the case have come off, but still has edges so that the bottom of my computer does not touch the surface it is sitting on."
4.0,Work as advertized.
4.0,"I like the shaver, I have fine facial not always get it all, however I still learning how to use and work with product."
4.0,"Sound quality is OK but not great, so it is really important that I place each speakers<br />at the right place to feel the surround sound. I think it worth the price."
4.0,Excellent
4.0,It works well
4.0,"I opted for this particular 128GB MicroSDXC card because of the specifications. So far, not bad at all.<br /><br />I upgraded from a 64GB A-Data card, and this one is much quicker.<br /><br />I am working towards a goal of having every song I've ever liked over the course of my entire life (several decades) on my phone. Cool, huh?<br /><br />In addition to my &#34;regular collection&#34; being on the card, it's providing me ample space to pursue the aforementioned goal.<br /><br />This is 100% working in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and I'm told it should work in ANY device that supports the ExFAT file system (all Samsung Galaxy devices that accommodate a MicroSD card included)<br /><br />Samsung says the Note 3 supports up to a 64GB card. It supports a 64GB, it also supports a 128GB, and it will probably support SanDisk's 200GB, too.<br /><br />I had been waiting patiently for the price on these to drop to around $50, and it did, so I pulled the trigger on it. I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />Now, to wait for SanDisk to release something ELSE huge - bigger than the 200GB (not 256GB???) that they have out now, so the 200GB card will drop, hopefully, to $50. Release a 512GB MicroSD already.<br /><br />Isn't it absolutely amazing how 128GB of memory is stored inside this tiny little memory card? Technology is amazing.<br /><br />Do it. Buy it. Please and thanks."
4.0,Very good product at a good price and I had it in my hands in no time flat.
4.0,Working just fine!!!
4.0,It's actually much better than I thought it would be. I usually don't consider motherboards with only two memory slots but this works well for it's purpose and the price ($40) is hard to beat!  Biostar is the brand I usually use and it's so far been pretty good for the past 5-6 years.
4.0,The drive itself is an excellent product. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is the cable interface. The cable it does with is very short and for many uses a longer cable is needed. It has a non-standard USB interface which necessitates buying a special cable not readily available locally.
4.0,"Great product - lap side is comfortable and soft without having it sink into your legs (and therefor making you hot), both fans work well and don't seem to use a lot of laptops power.  Worth the money"
4.0,Very useful when in the office or traveling. I just wish the cord were a wee bit longer.
4.0,It's good for a cheap speaker
4.0,It's what he needs. Now he wants Roku
4.0,Good except no on /off when using the cover.
4.0,This is a great case.  It's cute and durable too.  The only thing we've had trouble with is that it doesn't stand up all that well how it is shown in the pictures.
4.0,Bought two and one did not work. Did get a refund from Amazon.
4.0,"My second drive of the same type, but with a larger capacity now. Both work very well for at least 3 years now. I use it routinely to backup/store very important data at work and precious photos at home."
4.0,"Not the most expensive cable but not the cheapest either.  With limited use the cable's coating has completely broken away thereby exposing the wiring.  Would not buy again or recommend to anyone.  Cheap material simply not made to last.<br /><br />Follow up.  Sept 3, 2015. Don't know about the quality of the product but their customer service is terrific.  They contacted me after I posted my review and offered to send a replacement.  I was impressed with them reaching out in a proactive manner and will gladly give them another opportunity to get my business."
4.0,"It's not quite as nice as a product from Speck, but it's also quite a bit cheaper, at $16. Good, clean way to keep the soft aluminum safe from dings and scratches."
4.0,"good price, effective."
4.0,This cover was perfect for the AARP RealPad.  I liked having the ability to order what color I wanted.
4.0,great case; fits well; love the color.
4.0,Very nice item. It will fit inside another bag due to its size and configuration. Kudos to the designer.
4.0,Easy to install and drivers on disk worked fine. Works about the same as most wifi adapters I've used in this location. I think I will try a remote antenna and see if I can get a little better signal.
4.0,cant be updated to windows 10 but really like them !!!!
4.0,"Very straightforward router to set-up and install. I have Macs, so could not use the installation CD provided (it's a mini-CD that can't be loaded into the CD drives on my laptop/desktop).  That said, it was still easy to go online to TP-Link's website and download the driver software update and then complete the set-up through a web-browser.<br /><br />Signal strength is good for what I need, even with the router hidden away inside a very solid-wood secretary desk.  No issues with random restarts or spotty connections so far.<br /><br />There are also iPhone and Android apps for setting up and managing the router, which look pretty nice (although I haven't had to use it much so far since everything has been working well). I think you could get this set up with the app without having to connect another computer to the router, but didn't try that myself."
4.0,Good range. Have not lost my connection since I switched to this router.
4.0,"took a while to get use too and had to search for instructions on how to setup the buttons, the instructions were very lacking but other than that its ok"
4.0,it works perfectly with my hp g62 a13se
4.0,Will recommend
4.0,"Lives up to its claims.  Quietest click I ever heard from keyboard or mouse.  It cannot possibly bother anyone nearby.<br />My only complaint is that the scroll wheel hangs up slightly at one point in its rotation.  I like that it goes into low-power mode by itself, as I could never remember to turn off other mouses when I wasn't using them, although I do have trouble remembering I need to click it to get it reactivated.<br />Great product.  And inexpensive for the feature of diminshed complaints from others in the house."
4.0,As advertised.
4.0,I know it will take time to get used to this chomebook vs. my old laptop but I like it.  I do wish it was recommended to purchase a mouse with it or use with a mouse but I have one now to use.  I like the size and that it is light weight. I will have to learn how to use the mousepad because it is different as well.  but different is not really bad.
4.0,HI DO IS JOB WELL BUT THE SMALL SIZE COVER WELL THE KEYBOARD WITHOUT THE WRIST REST IF YOU HAVE A WRIST REST ON YOUR KEYBOARD PLEASE BUY THE BIGGER SIZE I'LL COVER DEPEND ON YOUR DIMENTIONS
4.0,"Addendum 9/15/15: TP-Link issued a new beta version of the firmware dated 21050911 today.  Unfortunately, it also has a defective DHCP reservation system that renders the router useless if DHCP reservations are enabled.<br /><br />Pros: This router has significantly better performance than the 7 year-old D-Link DIR-655 that it replaced.  It has better range but not to the degree that I could remove the additional access point on the opposite corner of my home.  The webpage interface and  the Android device interface app are both easy to use and reasonably comprehensive.<br />Cons: My biggest problem is that I had a 16-device DHCP reservation table on my DIR-655 that I could not reinstitute on the Archer C9, as doing so caused the DHCP process to become inoperable.  I had to settle for manually readdressing the devices that required a fixed hardwired IP address outside of the range of the dynamic DHCP address range.  I then let the computers on the LAN get dynamic addressing via DHCP.  When I want to locate their IP address, I have to go to the router's DHCP table.  I still have the potential problem of an address conflict among these computers if one has been asleep and finds that its address has been reassigned when waking.  This is a particular problem with laptops which might be carried around to different networks where that have to have dynamic addressing capability, and thus cannot be assigned a fixed address. I contacted TP-Link Support via email but have yet to hear back from them.  The router has the latest firmware (4.0.0 - 20150811)."
4.0,"The keyboard came in good condition, with the exception of one of the leveling feet was missing. I was able to remove that item from my old keyboard to make it complete. Otherwise, it functions like a new one."
4.0,I like. It
4.0,"I bought it for my aunt - so that she would be able to use it for whatsapp, facebook, skype, some games, etc. Worked OK most of the time - the maps app crashed twice."
4.0,"I am very happy with both the product, and the seller"
4.0,works just well as an addition monitor for my security system
4.0,"So far so good. Obviously hold a lot of files,music, photos, docs, etc. I'll take the filled up one with me when traveling, for refence and sharing of files. also a reasonable price."
4.0,Excelent
4.0,My kid wanted this and used his savings to purchase.  He loves messing around with it.  4 stars only because there aren't many instructions on how to get power to it and use it with his planned Lego creation.  If you know what you're doing this is likely really nice.
4.0,Love the small size as they don't take up much room on the desk. We're using them on a PC. The sound is good but there's a constant hum so we unplug when not in use.
4.0,This power supply more than meets my needs for my higher end GPUs and my additional internal hard drives. However the only fault I can truly find is that the fan is quite loud.
4.0,"Pros.<br />1. Great performance<br />2. HDMI & Display Port<br />3. Vents hot exhaust outside the case.<br />4. Supports Free sync and VSR.<br />5. 4GB of VRAM (Enough to max out GTA V) Runs GTA V like a dream with everything cranked to 11 @1080p Skyrim maxed with Demanding ENB settings @1080p. Yet to find a game in my arsenal that trips up this thing at 1080p.<br /><br />Cons.<br />1. Runs very hot! 95 degrees Celsius Under Load! Make sure you have a well ventilated case to keep this beast humming along at its maximum clocks.<br />2. Fan is a tad bit loud under Load. @47% You will hear it, but it wont really bother you unless you go past 50%. If you game with headphones, its not an issue at all,<br />3. High Power consumption."
4.0,"The title of the product says it all: Simple. I have several Samsung monitors and televisions, and I have been satisfied with all of them, including this monitor. It is easy to use and I primarily use it as a an external monitor for my keyboard. I plugged it in 5 minutes after its easy assembly out of the box and everything worked perfectly with no hassle. It is made well and has a sturdy stand. The only reason I gave it 5-stars is that of all my Samsung monitors, this one has the least vivid and colorful display. I'm guessing that has something to do with the &#34;simple&#34; branding, which puts it at a very good price point. Something probably had to be sacrificed to make it affordable."
4.0,"Installed in Mac Book Pro. Working great so far. Only 4 stars because I expected it to be heavier... Probably just a personal thing. Somehow I feel expensive items should weigh more... Anyway, I cloned my HDD before swaping. Worked great!"
4.0,"I like the size, it fits my hand very well. Seems to be built very well. I accidentally dropped it and it bounced a couple of times but not even a scratch. Very fast and smooth operation. I use it mainly for reading, surfing the web, and light gaming. The only issue I have had is it restarted by itself twice in about three weeks both times while using the silk browser so I don't know if it's hardware or app related."
4.0,"I use this solely as a stand for my old ipad1 in my kitchen for recipes. I think it would be too heave to put under the counter without some serious reinforcement. As a stand, it is great."
4.0,Cable works as advertised
4.0,Nice case but I ordered purple and this is more of a mauve or dusty rose color.  The front lower lip of frame kind of gets in the way of &#34;spin&#34; on my games but I like that it stands on it's own.
4.0,"Do its job, so it's cool."
4.0,Works great. Kids love it
4.0,Great skin but I wish it had instructions.
4.0,Delivery was fast item did not match the previous advert.The only disappointment was the spen.<br />I was expecting a nice silver one as it was shown in the picture not a black and gold which does not match to my white tablet. Also the case around the camera should fit nicer not perfectly tailored.
4.0,"Using it for Dual Graphics with my A6-6400k APU, A decent pick up in performance, but to be honest you're better off buying a discrete GPU that can top the integrated GPU. Unless of course you're just needing a card for extra display ports then this is a good card on that note."
4.0,"Cute little case stand, have used it for a few weeks now and still looks / works like new."
4.0,"I purchased this backpack for myself since I enjoy hiking often and my current bag isn't waterproof. The backpack had great straps for carrying lots of heavy stuff. I threw a bunch of water bottles in it, food, clothes, shoes, food for my dogs and more and there was still tons of room. It has a wonderful amount of pockets.  The bag was so heavy, yet still very comfortable to wear. It is indeed waterproof and rugged.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that the inside label has  a mistake on it. On the place where you put your personal info, there are marks on it for the number area, so that's no help if I happen to leave it somewhere. You can see that in my photos. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I love this! I'll be using this backpack for a long time. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,Worked as advertised.
4.0,"Fits great, not loose or floppy. Love the color. Glad I bought it!"
4.0,This is fabulous. I got this for a project and I was so glad that I didn't spend money on a more expensive brand.
4.0,Nice.
4.0,"While I have verified that the cable works with my meter, I have not yet used it to download data from the meter, since I am still using my old meter till it's supplies run out."
4.0,"Replaced a 7 year old targus backpack with this one. Wish the top handle had a bit more give so i can secure it to my rollerboard handle, but this backpack does the job and has a lot of space"
4.0,Exactly what I wanted
4.0,Good fur the price but I a.m. returning mine cuz won't hold Charge
4.0,Charges a little slower than
4.0,Mounting bracket works as advertised
4.0,good
4.0,ok
4.0,"The case fits perfectly and has protected my phone from several small drops. I don't think it would survive a serious impact or a toddler, but for the average mildly clumsy adult, the case provides great protection. The textured side makes it easier to keep a grip on the phone.<br /><br />This case is an excellent value. I wish it came in other colors, but I appreciate that it doesn't have a window on the back to show the Amazon logo like so many of the other cases that are compatible with my fire phone. Because seriously, Amazon - let's dial down the neediness a little, shall we? I don't need to advertise your product every time I use it."
4.0,Good
4.0,"This WAS the best keyboard I've ever owned (read update below)... I have no issues whatsoever with the Space Bar key, as others have... Just press the key towards the middle, not on the edges (there's no actuator there)... The keys are very quiet, and I love the low profile of the keyboard... The texture is absolutely amazing; I love the smooth, rubberized finish... Note that the red strip on the bottom has a plastic cover when shipped. You need to remove that for it to look right. Adjusting the Speed of the breathing affect could be a little more precise; it seems there's a big jump between the medium and medium-high settings... but anyway, I seriously love this keyboard. I would just say to be careful with the risers on the back. I accidentally broke one of mine when picking my keyboard up; even though I barely touched it. I would say the two flip-out risers on the back are the worst part of the keyboard, but that's an easy MacGuyver fix.<br />-------------------------<br />EDIT:<br />Its been almost a year, and I now use this keyboard at work, as I love how quiet the keys are. I work for a tech support company where I type all day, every day.<br /><br />The second riser in the back broke about a week after the first one did. I was still using it, while I would put a sticky notepad under the other side, so that it was even, but it didn't matter. The quality of the riser is just crap, and they should be ashamed for putting something like that on a keyboard like this. It really brought down the value and over quality.<br /><br />The lighting effects are still very good, and none of the keys show any sign of degradation. Little bits of dust and crumbs, etc, will get stuck in the bezel around the dragon emblem. Due to the very low resistance/feedback of the keys, I found myself making quite a bit of typing mistakes, as sometimes one or two keys just wouldn't register while I was typing. Honestly, this was not the best gaming keyboard, as it really doesn't seem to have all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time.all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time."
4.0,"I wanted to travel light with a small carry on roller for a short trip to Japan and needed a case for my laptop and gear while traveling the subways there. This is a basic case and does the job in a slim format. Materials are basic so don't expect it to be very classy but it will get the job done and won't take up much space if you need to pack it. Side pocket is large but not much flex, you can get a power adaptor in it but not much thicker than that. Handles are fabric so I think it could become uncomfortable quite quickly if you had a lot of weight in it. It does come with a shoulder strap though so you have the choice of how to carry."
4.0,i use it all the time - thanks
4.0,"Comfortable for long term gaming or watching streams/movies and sounds great, mic is not so great, but I bought the headset with the intention of better sound and build quality over my Turtlebeach X12. Have had it for a few months now and thankfully its all still in order. Would recommend! (But if you can get a better headset, then by all means get a better headset)"
4.0,"Great so far I upgraded to windows 10, no problem so far. I stalled Anti-Malware and Kaspersky, no problems so far. Did have 76 updates to install right off the bat took hours. Not impressed with the beatsaudio."
4.0,Great except Facebokk videos do not play.  Troubleshot with Amazon tech but still no go.
4.0,"So far this has been a good little tablet for my daughter. It plays her Netflix just fine, and the 3 games that fit in the memory with out a memory stick added on. We did have sound issues, but the seller was great and timely with replacing the defective one and the second one has worked so far with no problem."
4.0,Really protective
4.0,Good quality.
4.0,"Bought this card over a year ago for use with an amd a10-7850. I was under the impression that it could be used in dual graphics mode with my apu. I was initially disappointed because it wouldn't function in dual mode. I tried going to the newest drivers but it would still only work in single card mode. I ended up buying a more powerful card and putting this one in my closet. Just for kicks I swapped it out with my new card last week and did a video driver update and lo and behold it is now working in conjunction with my 7850. I'm pretty happy with it now as it plays my favorite game well(Skyrim) on ultra settings. The only caveat is the frame rate seems at times a bit choppy even though fraps is telling me I'm averaging mid 40's. It might be some type of stutter associated with dual mode. Other than that I'm pretty happy with it. I'm deducting one star because of the chop but for general computing and light to medium gaming the card works well. An added benefit is the fact that I used to have to turn my 7850 down to 65 watts or else it would eventually crash in games, despite the fact that I have a water cooler. Now for some reason I can turn it up to 95 watts and all is well."
4.0,"Liked that my iPad is protected, however only had two weeks and the corners are lifted but case has held in place.  Works great other then that have bought different brand and they arrived shattered so this was well packaged which was a plus."
4.0,does it's job
4.0,These are great.  The only thing about them is since the cover is right at the edge of the screen it can be hard to swipe up form the edge to get the volume and brightness control up.  But - it's not that hard to peel the case back a bit and do it.  It be better if you didn't have to do that though... that's for sure.
4.0,"Like this reader, the feel is comfortable and it works well overall with a nice screen. The &#34;button&#34; set up works, but I would still prefer a physical button. But to pay $200 for a reader that doesn't have 3G still irks me. That, with a few annoying design set ups with the operating system make me think a cheaper kindle is the better way to go probably."
4.0,It's a great case. The stand break's if the phone is dropped.
4.0,"Very Fast<br />No issues, but there should be something that describes why ACR and SMART VIEW hurts some eyes..<br /><br />Also, there are some options on the monitor that are greyed out.-.<br /><br />Overall GREAT PRODUCT though :D"
4.0,This works as described.  Pro:  Holds a lot of wires as you can put more than one wire in each slot.  Great to have all the wires in one place when you need to use one and not need to try and sort the right one out from a tangle of cords.  Only con is I wish it were heavier or had a way to secure it as it does move if you have a lot of cords in it.
4.0,My wireless mouse started acting weird and wasn't responding as quick as it should have been so I decided to get a new mouse. My 5 year old did help pick this out because he loves the glowing blue light that it has. It works great and was an awesome price. When i shut down my computer it still glows blue so I just turn the power cord off so that I am not using extra power all night. The scroll works great and I love how it feels. Will be buying another for my son's computer as a surprise for him.
4.0,"Perfect fit.  I would give it five stars, but it did not come with instructions.  We had to look up the instructions online."
4.0,:)
4.0,"I have used this adapter for a few weeks now, with my ThinkPad X220. It appears well built, and is functioning perfectly, without generating much heat, and without causing any audio interference. Yes, it is lighter than the original Lenovo charger, but I have an expensive compact charger that is lighter yet, and it has worked fine for years, so I don't see that as a negative. This is certainly a better choice and better value than the many counterfeit Lenovo chargers offered online, even here on Amazon."
4.0,"The outer casing is indeed aluminum, but the tray part that slides out is made of plastic. Unfortunately that nice looking vented front is part of that plastic tray. It still looks good and pulls a respectable amount of heat away from the drive, but calling it an aluminum enclosure is some exaggerated advertising. Other than that the enclosure is fantastic. It's sturdy and i'm getting the same speeds I got with the drive on an internal sata3 port. The blue light on the front is a nice touch."
4.0,"Great laptop for the price. Bought it for college so I can leave my desktop during breaks and settle with a laptop that can at least run LoL when I want to play something.<br />Pros: Good specs for the price<br />Cons: The touch pad is dreadful. I immediately went to buy a wireless mouse the moment I had the time to. The mouse pointer would sometimes just move away when I'm about to left click something. The battery life of the laptop also leaves something to be desired since when I'm in class using only Microsoft Word and looking up papers online, the battery would drain about 40% an hour (20% in power saving mode). The preinstalled Windows 8.1 also comes with a bunch of bulkware that fills up half of the bottom bar but you can have all of it removed once you get a free upgrade to Windows 10 which seems to have some compatibility issues with the Windows 10 software for this specific laptop on the Acer website."
4.0,Bargain priced but quite satisfactory compared to to others I've purchased at considerably higher prices. Worked right from the get-go.
4.0,The paperwhite is good so far. I haven't had time to really play with it.
4.0,I like it no probs. Works just fine
4.0,"So far I have not been disappointed. Works fine.<br />A little larger than I thought it would be, but to be honest I never even looked at that information.<br />The only draw back I can find is that it's a little stiff on the stand. It take both hands to adjust, which for most is probably a good thing for once it's set it isn't going to move on it's own."
4.0,"As I said in the title, the design feels somewhat flimsy and fragile but it works and is stylish"
4.0,I love the tablet. I do wish that I could load an sd card though to put my son's movies on for when we travel. The audio and graphics are very clear.
4.0,usefull
4.0,My needs are not very taxing for this keyboard/mouse pair. They are both within 5 feet of my computer. I have them on a moving platform that makes having wired units impractical.<br /><br />The keyboard does feel a bit cheap (light/plasticky) when typing but for the price and *my* needs this is fine. I don't think I'd be satisfied if this was my primary keyboard.<br /><br />I dinged this a star due to the occasional pauses that the mouse exhibits while I'm using it. I'm on a pretty high-end Alienware Windows 7 64 Bit machine with 12 GB of RAM and a potent i7 processor.  Yet inexplicably the mouse will pause in mid-swipe now and then for a second or two and then continue on as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />The machine is primarily a flight simulator and so the mouse is largely used for configuration instead of day-to-day surfing and working so this works well enough for my needs.
4.0,"Gave my Apple laptop about 4 hours up time. Probably not up to what could be provided by an Apple battery, but OK for my limited needs."
4.0,"Great product, Keep a shopping list and take a photo with your phone just before.  Perfect scratch pad.  I could also envision some good doodle party games with this."
4.0,workes quickly and has a sturdy plug to computer
4.0,"Nice bag, feels sturdy and won't fall apart quickly. My only complaint is not enough small pockets. There is only a couple. And there are no small with easy access-you have to unclip and open the main flap. Small pocket for a passport/cell on the outside with zipper or velco would make this bag a 5-star."
4.0,"The design feels flimsy, but it gets the job done. Pretty much just a connector and a hollow aluminum shell."
4.0,It was overall good i would give it 5 stars if it wasnt too glossy its like a fingerprint magnet
4.0,Large capacity.  Resasonable price
4.0,"Honestly, when I unboxed and first turned on this little device, the experience wasn't that pleasant as I expected. It comes completely uncharged and takes up to 6 hours to be fully charged. Also, Windows 8.1 is kind of a clunky operative system and doesn't behave that good as is expected to be in a tablet/netbook pc.<br />But, here is why I give a 4 stars rating to this little device:<br />1. For the price, this device performs a very good performance,  of course I don't use it for hard work, but for casual gaming and internet surfing it is ideal. I mostly use it for reading in the Kindle app (Kindle app for Windows still has a lot or room for improvement, but it is another story) and for watching videos in YouTube.<br />2. Battery life is very long. Ok, it takes 5 hours for a full charge, but it lasts 1.5 days for me. (I always use it with the battery saver configuration which works very good for me). So I let it charging during the night and forget about this 5hours charging time thing.<br />3. It is a really usable portable device. Let's face it: I also own and Ipad, but the Ipad doesn't give me any productivity, before buying the Asus, I always preferred to use my laptop instead of a tablet, because although Windows is awful, it has the things I need. Now, I am always trying to use my Transformer instead of my laptop, because it's little form factor + productivity make me feel so comfortable.<br />4. The physical Keyboard and touch pad. I am really happy I bought a windows tablet with a physical keyboard, the experience would have been totally different without it. Typing is quicker and also the keyboard works as a nice stand for your tablet when you are watching videos. So, here is my advice for everyone buying a windows tablet: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD, I can bet the experience would be hideous.<br />5. Another advice: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITH LESS THAN 2GB OF RAM. Simple, windows doesn't work well with less than 2gb.<br />Now, Why did I not give 5 stars:<br />1. Drivers issues, specially when upgrading to windows 10. Upgrading to Windows 10 was far from pleasant in this device. I had several BLUE SCREENS OF DEATH, yes and all the drama that comes with it in the middle of a Windows installation. I thought I completely ruined my tablet during the process. I have technical background so I knew how to fix it, but I wonder how a non technical user would react to this fatal errors.<br />2. I hate windows, I use it just because it is practical. But being honest it works awful and the apps available are very crappy. Facebook app is so poor, it looks just a 2010 facebook app version for ipad. Kindle:same thing, and Netflix, crashes for no reason always. Windows 10 is definitely a good improvement, but it is still klunky and awkward to use. So, another advise: DON'T BUY A WINDOWS TABLET  IF YOU WANT TO HAVE COOL APPS OR A COOL TABLET EXPERIENCE. Windows tablets are small computers, no tablets, they give a different experience to windows, and certainly make it nice to use with touch, but windows tablet are not as smooth and flawless as ipads or android tablets. Don't buy this tablet to your little kids or elders, because this is more a serious tablet, not a fun al the way easy to use tablet."
4.0,"You guys literally brought my S3-391 back to the road!.<br />Although the instruction manual has no instructions at all, and its limited to warnings about avoiding nail the battery ( I still wonder the reasons behind someone would like to pierce a lithium container after all). I've never changed an internal battery, but that's not a real problem, just being careful and half and hour and it's done.<br />Also, the packaging is not that great, just foam and soft paperboard. I expected something more secure to transport a laptop component, it's not a critic, just a suggestion, maybe some bubble wrap and anti-static bag would be better.<br /><br />Finally, I had to ask a good friend of mine who made a business trip to the US to recieve the battery, cause BTExpert does not supply this product as international shipping item. This made some issues to set a specific adress and I was a little concerned because the product became disappeared a few days at the location, and my friend had to contact to USPS to ask for the person that received and signed to the delivery. I'm not against paying for int. shipment, but BTExpert even does not allow the option.<br /><br />In spite some issues, I recomend the product."
4.0,"This is not an HP branded replacement, it is generic. However, unlike many other generic chargers on here, this one is of good quality.<br /><br />You can tell it's not super cheap as it has a decent weight to it. The cord has held up for over 6 months now, and I would probably buy this again."
4.0,A+
4.0,"Now I'm able to watch a movie or tv show, without looking at the time. Love it."
4.0,Extended Life Battery for a lesser price.
4.0,"Doesn't have an indicator to show the actual charging, but it does it's job charging"
4.0,Fit is great.  I saw some reviews that had problems with the Raspberry 2.  It looks like that has been taken care of with the new version of this box.  The only problem was that to mount the camera in the top of the lid the camera ribbon cable has to be twisted for the camera to be oriented properly for the lens to see through the hole in the Pi logo. If the logo was turned over the cable would not have to be twisted.  I choose to cut away a little of the logo plastic so the cable didn't twist.
4.0,Recommended 100 % excellent product
4.0,It works perfect👍🏻. Thanks
4.0,"Easy to set up, no dropped wifi and better speeds"
4.0,"Well built, was slightly disappointed that their is only one power switch. Would love to be able to shutdown just one drive at a time to swap it while the other drive is still in use."
4.0,excellent  price. does  what  it  promises.  and  it  arrive  BEFORE  expected  delivery  date
4.0,It works great.  I bought this after I tripped and broke the ethernet port on my laptop.  I prefer a cabled connection when large data backups.  This works great.
4.0,Goo
4.0,This item could use a little tweak as it covers the bottom return arrow just a little.<br />But other than that fits good.
4.0,Great product....however need improvement on cover finish..... Black cover scratches easily...
4.0,"This is the third 6&#34; Kindle Fire HD we have purchased so we must like them. The reason I don't give them three stars is because they have no memory expansion slot. This would put them right up there with Samsung if they would do this. I use the memory expansion slot very often in my other tablet devices including my Android phones. Great picture and good sound with an unlimited supply of apps and games available from Amozon and the Play Store. Fairly easy to transfer files from another device to the Fire. Also, battery life is good, for the size of the devise, as I get about five hours of video play on average."
4.0,"The fuchsia colored one is actually more of a hot pink just to let you know. I used two day shipping to receive this item. I was supposed to receive it on the evening of the second day but I got it right as I woke up that morning, which was a pleasant thing to wake up to.I was a bit hesitant about this product but so far I am pleased with it. The thing that attracted me to this case was that i was water resistant. I live in rainy Florida and I'm starting school right around the time when we will be pounded with rain. While i can keep my papers safe within my binders and folders, my laptop would be virtually naked. I tested out the water resistance by drooping a glob of water on the surface of the case. While it did absorb a bit of the water, it was completely dry on the inside.<br /><br />I believe the only con to this case is the lack of handles. But this isnt really a issue for me since i plan on carrying a large handbag with me around the campus. My 15.6 inch HP notebook fits perfectly inside as well. I will follow up on this review if I encounter any issues"
4.0,I was very happy to receive my new Fire HD6 especially after realizing that there is so much you can do with it.  I would definitely recommend to my friends and family.  So glad I decided to order from Amazon.  They always seem to surpass my expectations as well when it comes to delivery.
4.0,Overall I am happy with it thus far - the only thing I'm not fond of is how thick it is. I bought it primarily to use under my laptop on my desk so it makes the keyboard a bit higher than I would like. Other than that it has worked well and runs very quietly.
4.0,It's a good keyboard but there trackpad seems touchy and the keys slightly lightweight for my taste.  Also the range wasn't enough for cross room distances for the build I did - s0 it went back.  Replaced with MacAlly (Hackintosh build).
4.0,"its a pretty big and i can barely fit my side panel back on, but it definately works awesome as the cpu cooler"
4.0,Great but a little problem to fit
4.0,"Doesn't work with my portable charger, but that might be an iPod issue rather than a problem with the cord."
4.0,"Like it a lot, however, the wrist portion isn't holding up as well as I thought it would.  Has gotten pretty squished down but I've had it almost a year.  Still like it."
4.0,"Bought two of these, one for me and one for the husband after he saw mine.  Excellent value for the price and came with windows 10.  We were both running old vista machines (mine an old HP that died and his an old Toshiba that's still going strong) and we thought it best to just jump into 10 instead of dealing with an upgrade from 7 or 8.  That was an excellent decision as it turns out.  Getting this baby up and running was about as easy as it gets.  In the past I've always had someone else get my new computers up and ready for use but this time we did a lot of homework and decided we'd do it ourselves.  A little web research made a world of difference and we got both machines up and running very easily.  Making restore flash drive was simple, working through first-time set up was simple.  Shutting off all the privacy settings we deemed instrusive was simple.<br /><br />This new Toshiba does not have the build of older machines as many reviewers have stated but for us that's not an issue.  We're not taking either of them anywhere.  A lot of reviewers have complained about sharp edges but I discovered that once the dark green transparent tape was removed from around the bottom edge of the machine, the edges were fine.  But if you don't get that tape off it can be really uncomfortable to type.  It's hard to see but it' there and will just peel off with some patience.  I've been touch-typing for over 40 years on all kinds of keyboards so getting used to this one was easy.  It doesn't have the feel of a heftier machine but it responds well and does the job.  On arrival, everything worked correctly and<br />one month into use everything still works.<br /><br />I suggest that on set-up you update all your drivers.  Don't rely on auto updates for this.  Go through all your devices manually and search for driver updates and you'll find a lot of them out there.  I had some speaker issues (as another reviewer mentioned) and getting the newest drivers for the software has fixed that.<br /><br />Neither of us really like using the touchpad so we both got inexpensive Tecknet Bluetooth mice and they run perfectly on this machine.<br /><br />All in all, for $450.00 this machine offers great utility and value and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs something for middle of the road home use.  I would not recommend it as a machine suitable for daily portability, however, since the build just doesn't seem conducive to that."
4.0,I love it
4.0,"My daughter loves it, thank you"
4.0,"Good sound, especially for the price.  If you want decent sound for your office, these are a value."
4.0,Item as described. Arrived quickly. Works.
4.0,"Just bought it appears to be working well. The only thing is that it isn't as good of a fit as the original battery, but most non-manufacturer batteries have this problem. Still a way better price than the manufacturer replacement battery."
4.0,"Very light, nice grip, worth the price.<br />I would buy another one of these if I happen to need another wired mouse."
4.0,"Exactly as advertised. Worked fine in a white unibody Macbook (13-inch, late 2009). Apple still states that the max memory on that model is 4GB (2GB x 2) but as noted elsewhere 4GB x 2 is fine."
4.0,"Except that Amazon doesn't like competition, it's a great tool. It won't let me have he Etsy app (bc Etsy is a marketplace). It's not intuitive like Mac products but simple enough to navigate. Graphics and sound are excellent."
4.0,"It definitely met my expectations with one exception.  For the life of me, I can not understand why there is no two way camera."
4.0,"Worked well, until we plugged them into the computer"
4.0,"I really like the cover. When I made my purchase, I thought that I was buying a cover that was actually rubber not plastic, but this cover is plastic. Even still, I'm satisfied!"
4.0,Kool case
4.0,GREAT ITEM
4.0,good
4.0,I feel it doesn't truly fit my MAC. But it's not bad.
4.0,"I have had this for only a few weeks time, but so far I am happy with it. I love the 128GB! It is quick to load and download. I dumped the entire contents of my old drive onto this one in no time.[[ASIN:B00HR7FWUC SanDisk Extreme PRO CZ88 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive Speeds Up To 260MB/s- SDCZ88-128G-G46]] The physical drive itself is sturdier than the plastic ones I have had and I like this as mine takes a lot of use and abuse. I actually find this one slightly slimmer than the old plastic ones. It fits nicely into my USB port with other items plugged in next to and above it. I also liked the way my flash drive 'key loop' fits easily through the end. I maybe could have given it a 5, but I have not had it long enough to rate it's longevity. I would purchase this item again."
4.0,"Good tablet, wish screen display was IPS hd"
4.0,so glad this was all I needed to bring my computer back to life! :)
4.0,"The mouse is beautiful, and I adore it. It responds well, and the center red button adjusts the mouse sensitivity. I have had 0 issues in the month I've owned it besides the actual blue lights draining batteries like candy. However that is the only issue I've had."
4.0,Core Clock: 1000 MHz<br />Boost Clock: 1076<br />Memory Clock: 7010<br />Length: about 12 inches its a monster<br />power: x2 8 pin adapters<br /><br />Price is about $680 when I purchased<br />Now on the detail of this card this is the non overclocked version of the Asus Strix<br />which is why the clocks are so low but can easily be overclocked to Strix Oc level<br />-<br />Currently stable at 1450 Coreclock  and 7600 Mem Clock<br />Overpriced for standard clocks.
4.0,Types very nicely and Extra keys provide shortcuts which is a timesaver. The only feature that would be helpful is if the case had a latch to keep the case closed when not in use. I would still highly recommend this product.
4.0,Great quality; beautiful vibrant colors.
4.0,good for the price
4.0,"The keyboard connected quickly to my iPad.  It feels good in the hand.  The cover attaches to the unit with a magnet and is hinged so you can use is flat, tilted, or removed. You still have to use the onscreen touchpad for things like sending a text, but at least you can type messages easier.<br /><br />The keyboard has good tactile feel.  The keys take a bit to get used to, since it is a compact keyboard. The keys controlling play/pause work but the fast forward/back don't with either Netflix or YouTube.<br /><br />I've only used this with an iPad. Not having function keys makes it unacceptable for use with a windows machine.<br /><br />I recommend this keyboard with reservations."
4.0,I can't say how this video card performs because Amazon accidentally sent me the GeForce GTX 960 instead. After calling them about the mix up they told me to keep it for which I was grateful. The 960 performs extremely well and I would recommend it to anyone who can afford it and is into higher end gaming.
4.0,Upgrading from my old Netgear adapter to this model gave me a 1 to 2 bar improvement in my wifi signal and I love the ability to position it anywhere on my work desk. Thumbs up!
4.0,Just got this on August 28. Nice tablet. Pretty quick. Front speakers are great.<br />I'm am a little upset that I just saw it at Best Buy for $50.00 cheaper.
4.0,This is working just the original one did before I lost it.
4.0,Great company.  I bought these when one of my other modules failed.  The manufacturer replaced the faulty under the lifetime warranty.
4.0,"This is my 5th kindle. I still have the 1st gen Kindle and 3 keyboard Kindles, all of which still work great! The only reason I bought this one is because it was offered to me at $29. I couldn't say &#34;no,&#34; so I bought it. Can anyone ever have too many?  Anyway, I am enjoying the lighter weight of it and it works as well as, if not faster, than my older and very reliable ones."
4.0,This unit does the job and will save me big $$$$$ in the long run.  Renting the TWC modem is costly and when it can be replaced with this unit it is a no brainer.
4.0,Very happy with the quality and appearance.
4.0,"Note: I use this for art. Can't say anything about OSU!<br />Pros:<br />Pen is good, and the amount of pressure it takes to write or draw isn't heavy but leans towards the light side. (It fits my style of writing)<br />The small space isn't a big issue personally since I'm used to writing small when taking notes in school. (In the issue of space, I don't use this to take notes. Also this is more of a personal opinion but in case there are people who also write small and don't mind a small writing/drawing space)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Really wish that the mini USB connection was on the other side of the tablet since the USB cable gets in the way all the time.<br />Buttons on pen can be easily pressed and can cause some issues depending on whatever you're doing."
4.0,"Like it, but too heavy and volume control is not loud enough. My phone is ideal but too small. So, have to have two devices."
4.0,"If you have dogs or cats, it picks up hair very easily."
4.0,"Works great, but i can tell it was made for people with especially large heads. Whenever i lean my head back in frustration when i die in CS:GO, it almost falls right off, which is a bit of a problem. Also, the Dolby surround sound switch out right SUCKS, all it does is make it sound like you're in an echoey room with everything and does not work as advertized."
4.0,"Solid fit for automotive (bouncy) use, and perfect length for my application."
4.0,Works quite well with my iOS devices. Paired without difficulty. Key feel is pretty good for a bargain-priced keyboard. No complaints.
4.0,This memory worked great in my HP Laptop.
4.0,"Great product, my husband is happy with it. No issues at all. Delivery time was fine and they were easy to apply."
4.0,Good device. Great price
4.0,Upgraded from a 550ti and there was a HUGE difference in performance. Its a good step up if you don't want or can't invest in the 900s yet.
4.0,Exactly what I needed at the right price.
4.0,"The connection to the phone is chunkier than usual, but it works well!!!"
4.0,Works well
4.0,Excelent. 100% recomend
4.0,I love it
4.0,"I like this mouse it works well, but is smaller than I would have prefered"
4.0,"Great case very sturdy, cam with just  a USB plug and very  minimal instruction, Other then not knowing how to get it to even post on Facebook ! Other then that it has multi color lighted keyboard, just learning it is the task at hand ."
4.0,My only complaint is the ear muffs are not comfortable for long periods of time.  Anything over 30 minutes becomes a pain in the ear literally.
4.0,ear muffs a little small for my ears.
4.0,"Main takeaway: I'm very pleased with the purchase overall and highly recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for everyday usage.  Remember especially that many people over-buy or get talked into things they don't need.  The i3 in this system is more than capable of performing the majority of tasks most users will require of it.  Gamers who need a video card capable of running the latest and greatest new releases will need to look elsewhere, but this laptop should be fine for anyone who will be mostly surfing the internet, watching streaming videos, listening to music, writing emails, working with word processing, etc.<br /><br />Remember that buying it with certain credit cards (American Express, Visa Signature, others?) will automatically double the manufacturer's 12 month warranty.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- At $350 shipped, it's essentially a $300 laptop with specs appropriate to the price and a $50 full-HD 1080p screen.  Maybe the market is moving to HD at this price point, but I doubt there are many systems out there with these specs/screen at this price.  I was considering a Chromebook or the like, but for $100 (or less) I got a fully functional PC with a full HD screen.  Wow.<br /><br />- Battery life after unpacking and charging overnight shows 4.5 hours on the battery  saver setting.  I suspect 3-4 hours is probably realistic once it's being used.<br /><br />- The screen looks great with a bit of light bleeding on the bottom edge of mine.  It's only noticeable in a dark room while watching a dark movie, so I'm possibly being overly critical.  Again, $350, and wow.  The viewing angles are okay but I'm sure they'd look horrible if placed next to a $2000 laptop.<br /><br />- Not a touch screen.  That may be in the &#34;con&#34; section for some, but I've got an ultrabook that I never, ever use the touchscreen on.  I'm sort of glad this one doesn't have it in order to minimize failures and faults that could potentially be associated with it.<br /><br />- Touchpad - Most importantly, it doesn't appear to interfere with or affect typing.

4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for myself because I was in need of a new tablet when mine was stolen. When I saw this on sale and saw the reviews I decided to order one. Received it in the mail about a week ago. The 6 inch size is perfect for me and perfect if you are taking this tablet with you everywhere like I do and great to use at home to relax or surgery the web. It runs very smooth on videos and internet. Have not had it crash or be slow. Setting it up was very simple and quick. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I didn't like that I would have had to pay extra to have the tablet come without the ad backgrounds. I didn't choose to pay extra and it's not a big deal but I would have liked having a more customized tablet without having to pay extra.
4.0,"A little hard to fit into the computer, but worth it!"
4.0,Am extremely pleased with this case especially after having such issues with the first one I ordered.  Easy to hold and use the keys and applications with this case.  Even the materials feel real with this case compared to many others that I have tried.
4.0,"Once you get over the HUGE hurdle of getting these things connected right, they work really well. Documentation is BAD, but there are others who have struggled through it before, so if you're having problems read the reviews and get some ideas. Once you get it working the way you want they are solid cameras.  I am using iSpy Connect (it's free) to handle all of my alarms and recording. Here's how I got the cameras to work: Pop the disk that comes with the camera into your computer, go to Software&#62;IEActive and install the General_IE exe. (Unfortunately this also installs their security program NetSurveillance, but you can uninstall later) Once that's installed make sure your router is using a 192.168.1.XXX network. Open Internet Explorer (will not work in any other browser) and go to 192.168.1.10. At the top right is your language selection. The username is &#34;admin&#34; and the password is blank. (You may need to adjust your ActiveX settings) At the top of the screen you can change all the settings you want under DeviceCfg. To adjust the image quality change the settings on the RIGHT under Encoder. (Change the IP address LAST, if you set to DHCP, check your router to see assigned IP) Once you have it configured how you want go into iSpy and choose Add&#62;IP Camera With Wizard. Set the camera as an Empire ESC 4, then enter the username (&#34;admin&#34; by default) and the password (blank by default) and channel 1. Next type in your IP and use port 554. Select no to scanning for more feeds and choose the URL listed. It should be an FFMPEG (H264) at URL: (No Password) rtsp://admin@IPADDRESS:554/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=1.sdp?real_stream--rtp-caching=100 (Password: myPW) rtsp://admin:myPW@IPADDRESS:554/user=admin&password=myPW&channel=1&stream=1.sdp?real_stream--rtp-caching=100 If you happen to lose the password you can email the seller back and forth for a month like I did. (Their English is a little rough) Or you can send me a message and I'll sendyou the password reset program.  I hope this helps.  Pros: Inexpensive Good picture quality Solid unit  Cons: Setup Setup Setup"
4.0,"I like this headset, I'm used to David Clarks which are the same style. These did have a metallic rattle every time I moved my head, I fixed this by inserting a small piece of plastic on each side, now they are fine. The headset cord has the 4 connector plug that most mobile devices now use but also in the box is an adapter cord that converts the 4 conductor plug into two separate plugs for the headset and microphone."
4.0,"I got this because I wanted to speed up an old pc I had. I was using an Athlon 64 3000. I ran into some problems at first, but troubleshooted the problems. It didn't really give the performance boost as I was expecting, but it works with minimal improvement."
4.0,My 7 year bought this with his birthday money.  He is really excited about it and has loaded some apps and games which he had no problems with.  I only gave 4 stars so far because the touch screen sensitivity seems off sometimes.  We're trying to adjust it or see if the screen protector is interfering.  So far he is very pleased.  I think it is a great value for the money.
4.0,The only parts keeping this from a 5 star is the instructions are horrible. Garbled English is a forte so I was okay but part of me just cringed. The other is the lack of components that were supposed to be in the package. I had the missing items left over from the phone screen protector. I'm still trying to figure out what this giant blue sticker is for...... The instructions says it is the alcohol wipe?!?!?!? It is literally a piece of super clear plastic. Takes some work to get the bubbles out but once they are gone you have to look close to screen this protector there. I'll keep it!!!
4.0,"The quality of the keyboard and mouse overall is great. The shape definitely helps your wrists and the keys have a god tactile feedback without being noisy. However the biggest negative with this is that the wrist pad starts turning white after a few months of use (possible due to skin oils) and doesn't really go off easily. There is no easy way to clean it and no instructions either. I used one of the alcohol wipes and that did a reasonable job, but for a keyboard at this price I would expect it to have a better quality pad."
4.0,Very cool
4.0,I purchased this Wifi range extended to extend the range of my home wireless network out to my barn to setup several wireless IP cameras. It was very easy to configure and setup on my network. After following the instructions the device appeared in my network and I was able to connect my cameras to it just fine. Before I installed the extender my cameras were unreachable most of the time. They have now been connected and streaming video for more than 24 hours without a problem. Also now my cell phone gets a much better connection to my network when I'm at the barn.
4.0,It was what was expected. It worked.
4.0,NOTE: This doesn't seem to work with a Dremel Idea Builder 3D printer. It DOES work great in everything else I've tried it with.
4.0,"I bought two of these shell cases: the green & the red. Items arrived quickly (in 5 days). The covers snapped on in seconds & fit perfectly. The colors were a little bit off from the seller's pictures. The green is more like lime green & the red, as one reviewer said, is more of an orangey red. Not that big of a deal. Quality is okay. [[ASIN:B00QH8PCA2 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Green)]] and [[ASIN:B00QH8S5R4 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Red)]]"
4.0,"Overall, just a great value in a Windows tablet!!"
4.0,"Very good case, that provides good protection for my iPad and the buttons are easy to press. Wish it had some sort of kickstand though."
4.0,Great replacement battery for my HP Envy dv6 7323cl laptop at a fraction of the price of a new battery from HP!  Longer battery life than the original battery! Update: battery lasted for 8 months.  I am now in need of a new one.
4.0,Just as it shows it came with everything:D
4.0,"The cable works well enough.  However, the profile on the micro usb side can too to high if the phone has protective case that does not have enough clearance for the connector to be pushed all the way in.  OTOH, this would be the case for the majority of the cables on the market except those that have market as Samsung cables.<br /><br />Would be nicer if it was 1ft or 2ft to use with a laptop or a desktop that has the USC connection in the front."
4.0,This is a pretty good case and I am happy with it. Wish it had some more protection Around the edges but overall it's good.
4.0,Works well. Have been using Kingston USB drives for years.
4.0,"EDIT, 12/16/2015: About 8 months or so after buying it, and having used it very little, probably fewer than a dozen times, something gave way inside and I discovered all the seams were lined with lots and lots of tiny little clear beads which appear to have been sewn in between the outer cover and inner lining, to act as the padding. It still looks good and all the straps and zippers are doing fine. I'll continue to use it, but I'll have to be a bit more cautious now that I know a good bit of the padding has come out.<br />________________<br />I bought a 12.2&#34; tablet for work and needed a case. After extensive shopping (yeah, I'm one of those), I settled on this one, because it checked all the boxes:<br />...perfect fit.<br />...well padded inside without adding any noticeable bulk.<br />...adjustable padded detachable shoulder strap that swivels so it akways lies flat.<br />...double handle.<br />...strong zipper closure.<br />...pockets to carry a few things.<br />...Bonus: It looks good. The cloth color is true to what appears on my screen, and it's just a little different from the black cases everyone else has, while still looking professional.<br />Very very pleased!"
4.0,life saver.  found a bunch of photos that were save to 3.5&#34; floppy disk at time of possessing.  Now I can put them on my computer and it work great.
4.0,Works great day 1.
4.0,it works well thanks
4.0,very good
4.0,Is a nice product hope won't fail as some of the sd cards
4.0,Good
4.0,Nice bag. Little smaller than I expected..
4.0,It's works very well..
4.0,The battery is great it gives me about 2.5 full charges on my IPhone 6 . The battery died after about 4 months but they contacted me and sent me replacement with in 3 days wonderful service thank you
4.0,Working fine.  Like the fan.
4.0,Worked just fine for me. I am not a gamer and I have had no speed problems with this computer.
4.0,"I really like the case, but I wish I didn't have to pop it out of the bottom two clips in order to use the stand features for the case."
4.0,"This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected."
4.0,"Received the I pad air life proof case the other day. I have one for the I phone 5s and love it. Make sure to clean I pad air front and back  and the front of the case which is a plastic piece. There is an &#34; oil&#34; coloring of sorts when tilted just right when all put together. I am not concerned because of the wall paper, can&#34;t  see the &#34;oil&#34; coloring. Reviewers have mentioned about the difficulty of the on/ off switch. I have difficulty with the off but the on is no problem. Don't know why. Even took apart case with ease ( tool is included) to maybe reposition I pad air but problem still there. The camera front and back work just fine. The volume buttons work fine, no issues.  I did have an issue with the seller. Did not receive any tracking data until the day before  it arrived. I like the case, does protect, not heavy, actually easier to handle, doesn't slip out of your hand or of off your lap. No finger prints and ports are accessible."
4.0,"Excellent,  4 stars because not come with the CD, I hope lasts"
4.0,"I really like that this works either with the included USB dongle or without it using Bluetooth. I use this primarily with my Surface 3 Pro when not powered and not at my desk. It folds flat for easy transport in my bag, can be used as a PowerPoint control with laser pointer, and doesn't take up the lone USB port. The Surface has Bluetooth turned on most of the time to support the Surface Pen anyway, so connecting to it with the mouse doesn't have much effect on battery life. The only problem is that it's too easy for it to be turned on accidentally. It could really use a slip cover that prevents the center button (laser, scroll) from being activated by bumping against something in the bag. That's a pretty small hit."
4.0,bang for buck this is a great graphics card.
4.0,"I love it. Games, videos, books and email all in one place. Perfect size and lightweight."
4.0,"got this, popped it in and it works fine! a little pricey for this type of memory, but it matched my existing stick!! for that, 4 stars from me!!"
4.0,"This is a really great keyboard and I do love it over all but I've had it for a couple weeks now and the A key refuses to work some of the time. I've taken the key off to make sure nothing is underneath and the button works just fine if you push it directly but after a while it just doesnt seem like the key will press it down enough. I'm not sure but it makes for an interesting time typing.<br /><br />Over all though, I love the feel of the keyboard its so smooth and I enjoy that its flat. Its closer to a laptop keyboard than a normal bulky desk top one.<br /><br />I have used it pretty heavily and the keys are starting to get shiny from use already but they haven't started to fade."
4.0,Affordable
4.0,Works like a charm
4.0,As expected.
4.0,Good transmitter need to go online for win 10
4.0,I like everything but the ads. Cant make them  go away
4.0,Improved speed.
4.0,Great option if you are looking for a transportable keyboard.  Auto shut off feature is a great battery saver.  Pairing with my Samsung Note 8 was as easy as falling out of a tree.
4.0,Good product for a good price.
4.0,It's more compactly designed & gives a great look to the tab.
4.0,"I probably would give it more stars, but It's my first one and I'm still trying to learn haw to use it."
4.0,Very good
4.0,no problem with install.  Only problem was with software down load needed another application to open.
4.0,Excellent value for the money.
4.0,"Nice case, somewhat thick"
4.0,"This is my first e-reader, and I like it a lot. I was doubtful about giving up actual books, and was afraid it was going to be a cumbersome device to operate, but I was mistaken. These are some of the things that I think make this a very good product:<br />- The portability and light weight of the device. It makes it possible to comfortably read in many places.<br />- The illumination of the device does not strain the eyes, and it makes it possible to read in a darkened room.<br />- The fact that you can have hundreds, and perhaps thousands of books in it.<br />- The fact that you can actually highlight stuff.<br />- Being able to get the meaning of a word (and it can keep track of which ones you look up so you can review later) via an e-dictionary and Wikipedia.<br />- Being able to translate terms.<br />- Being able to get book samples to &#34;test-read&#34; them before actually deciding to buy.<br />- There are probably other features that I haven't explored.<br /><br />The only con I've found is that it does not successfully connect to certain wi-fi networks, especially those in which you would have to click &#34;Accept&#34; somewhere. To be fair, this may be user error rather than the device, but that's yet to be determined."
4.0,"Love how it looks!  At first it would not stay snapped on to the laptop, but now it stays securely attached.  Won't protect much against damage caused by impact but protects against spills and dirt."
4.0,"This bag is very compact with a great feel. It came smelling like very fresh leather as well, so the quality is up there. The only imperfection was near the button opposite the logo; the leather is a slight shade lighter due to wear."
4.0,Really nice. Good quality. A bit over priced to me.
4.0,"so far so good I just got it ,it is quiet and it was easy to install and you have more than enough connectors to hook up every thing you have to,."
4.0,So far I'm really enjoying my new case. It fits my 13&#34; Mac perfectly. Where each handle is located is just big enough for the plug on one side and my phone in the other. I would have preferred a zipper pocket but I haven't had any trouble with my plug or phone sliding out of the pockets so I'm happy. I love the print. It's a canvas like material.  I'm a bit concerned how well it can be cleaned. Oh the inside is lined with a fuzzy material that protects my Mac nicely. Overall great purchase for the money :)
4.0,"Sweet design. Matches apple Bluetooth keyboard beautifully. Holds my apple ipad mini comfortably with no scratching at all when I insert my iPad mini. It IS WOBBLY if you shake a desk or slam a draw to the desk it may be placed on, so place it in a solid, secure surface. Other than that , love the design and the how it matches my apple keyboard."
4.0,It works thanks for the electrical charge for my Surface Pro 2
4.0,Turned my computer into a projector.
4.0,Amazing...it was delivered to Singapore  on time as per the promise. Of course the product every good
4.0,As always a reliable and taken for granted product!
4.0,Good and simple case
4.0,just fine
4.0,It is very bright. I find I need to cover some of the bulbs. Better to be too bright than not bright enough. I would buy it again.
4.0,"My fience feels like this is a better keyboard all-in-all, but the layout is different from the original.  It may take some getting used to."
4.0,I got this for my 8' Lenovo tablet and it is perfect I wanted a case with a large enough pocket to hop my foldable keyboard. Its perfect l! Very durable and so soft inside
4.0,it's fit
4.0,"I just pre-ordered it and can't wait to get my hands on it! Really the only reason why I bought this is because how it looks and I needed a gaming mouse.<br />For anyone wondering, Corsair Scimitar will be available 10/22/2015 (according to Newegg.com)<br />I actually like the yellow accent on this mouse, and its a bit disappointing that there isn't a couple color variation. If Corsair came out with a different color scheme I probably would look into it. (black and white, or red and black)<br />Also, because of the yellow accent, I don't know why this mouse is rgb, any other color than white or yellow will have a color clash."
4.0,Ok
4.0,the item delivered as described! awesome.
4.0,The speaker sounds great! The app stinks and for some reason I struggle with pairing two speakers
4.0,"I've only had this replacement battery for a couple weeks. The ability to hold a long charge is off/on but lately more on than off. Time will tell but I'm happy to have this replacment battery. Especially when the power goes out, for traveling, and for studying for long hours while out and about."
4.0,"The perfect bag for my Dell 13&#34; 2-in-1.  Love the color (hot blue), the heavy fabric, and the fact that the bag is well padded.  Only suggestion to manufacturer: consider adding a removable shoulder strap."
4.0,"UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER:<br />I bought two of these machines a year ago.... both of them have slowed down more and more as we've added applications to them as as time has gone by. One of the issues I see on both of them is that the hard disks seem very slow -- and show 100% hard disk utilization always under task manager. I have scanned for viruses on both machines and they are clean, and have run a number of troubleshooting steps. For basic work they are fine, but I would not buy this machine a year later... I think the disk transfer speed is underpowered for the processor and the memory. I also wonder if the drivers / etc (updated) have really been optimized for Windows 10.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I just bought one of these machines and liked it enough that I bought a second one for our house.  I bought it from the &#34;big blue electronics store with the yellow sign&#34; that rhymes with &#34;Test Try&#34; and it's usually on sale for either 549 dollars (best) or 579 so shop around.<br /><br />This won't be a review of Windows 10- though it works very well on this machine and discovery / installation of printers etc was immediate and seamless.  One issue I did have with both machines I bought is during the initial setup before updates are downloaded, the screen started flashing rainbow colors and I couldn't see anything except the colors.  With one machine I simply shut down and rebooted, and it then worked from then on, presumably after it loaded some updated video drivers, but with the other machine I was still in the middle of initial login account setup and turning off the machine actually crashed windows... I had to restore from a recovery disk I had created on the other machine.  So advice here is go through the setup screens as quickly as possible just to get a working account you can use to log in.<br /><br />Overall this is a good desktop that handles our word processing, email, internet and video playing just fine without stuttering or freezing.  Initial startup is about the same speed as Windows 7, contrary to what is claimed in the Windows 10 literature, and there seems to be a fair amount of startup activities once you do get to the desktop, even though I have disabled or delayed all but the essential ones.  After about 3 minutes at the desktop everything is loaded and speed is incredibly responsive -- for example Chrome and Word load almost immediately.<br /><br />With Windows 10 task manager you can see in much more detail where the bottlenecks are on a system and whenever it's slowing down I can see the bottleneck is the disk reading / writing, which will show 100% utilization.  Rarely does the CPU or memory column show high utilization... it is almost always the disk.  Too bad Dell hasn't figured out a way to speed up disk read / write (or go to SSD's) though I'm guessing price point plays a role here.  The CPU is super powerful and there's tons of memory so those are under-utilized most of the time unless I'm working with video, and even then no real issues.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this is the fastest computer we've owned with the best operating system, but you don't read these reviews to see all the good things, you can see those in the advertisements, I'm just trying to warn about some of the drawbacks.  But I liked it enough that I bought a second unit so that should tell you something.<br /><br />The computer comes with a standard Dell chiclet-style keyboard and an inexpensive laser mouse.  I put both of them in the closet and am using my own.<br /><br />Here are my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Powerful computer for this price point, once initial startup items load it's blazing fast<br />+ USB 3.0 ports (2) located in back of unit (wish one were in front, or better yet all usb 3.0)<br />+ Super quiet, can't even tell it's on<br />+ Good support - I've contacted Dell twice and have been pleased with the ease of interacting with them (vs HP)<br />+ Works seamlessly with Windows 10 - even 8 year old laser jets installed quickly and automatically<br />+ Gigabit ethernet port, even more important now that Comcast and other providers' speeds have passed 100 mbps<br />+ Integrated wireless works great<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Basic desktop same style of the past 10-15 years... zero design appeal, it's a workhorse, not pretty<br />- Disk read/write can be a bottleneck<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased to recommend this desktop... I will update this review if I run into any issues.  Feel free to leave questions in the comments section and I will do my best to respond within 48 hours.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful.that Comcast and other providers' speeds have passed 100 mbps + Integrated wireless works great  Cons: - Basic desktop same style of the past 10-15 years... zero design appeal, it's a workhorse, not pretty - Disk read/write can be a bottleneck  Overall I'm pleased to recommend this desktop...

4.0,"Been using mine for a few days. Seems like a solid system. Came well-packed, with no damage. The system specs are just as promised, except (thankfully) it does have 2 USB 3.0 slots, despite that not being listed on the specs. It is certainly a powerful system for the price. It has had no problem running anything I've thrown at it, as would be expected with an i7 running a GeForce 970. It is thankfully pretty light on the pre-installed bloatware, although it does come with one program (DVDVideoSoft) that absolutely will not uninstall, which is very frustrating. Assuming it proves to be reliable in the long run, I'm very happy with the computer.  A few notes:  1) It is a very nice looking system, but the case is NOT fully lit, despite the image. Only the front panel is equipped with green LEDs; the side window has no green lighting. It is also a very big case; be sure to have plenty of vertical space.  2) The liquid cooling works well, but only cools the CPU. The GPU is fan-cooled, and tends to run a little hot under heavy use, though not beyond the card's safe threshold. Easy enough to use a 3rd-party solution like Afterburner to set a custom fan curve. I do suggest doing so, though.  3) The front door is well disguised and a bit stiff. I did worry about breaking it when I first located it, but it does pop open with a good tug on the right side.  4) It does not have built-in WiFi. It comes with a USB WiFi dongle. It seems to work fine, though. Just too bad it has to take up a USB slot.  EDIT: 5/22/16 After a few months of use, the liquid cooler completely stopped working. I only realized this when my processor started throttling because it was hitting more than 100 degrees C, crippling performance. I got lucky; I caught it before there was any damage to the processor. I replaced the liquid cooler with a high-performance air-cooled CPU cooler, and added 3 case fans to improve airflow. Everything is okay now, but it's still a shame that the cooling system blew out after such a short time."
4.0,"It's cheap, and priced appropriately.<br />Nothing wrong with it; comes with a single LED fan. Perfectly normal case.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Costs about $20<br />- One blue LED fan<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Aesthetically boring<br />- Small, tight<br />- Heavy considering its small size"
4.0,Perfect for what I and my employees need.<br />Affordable and secure data encryption with the included SanDisk secure vault software.
4.0,Good disk
4.0,"Great offer, great value. I mostly do reading (it's a Kindle, after all) on this unit but checking email (Gmail), Facebook and Twitter makes it very handy. Would like to see it hold a charge longer (average three-four days between charges) but love form factor and ruggedness. Overall, very pleased!"
4.0,purchased in 2010 and still works like champ
4.0,"Needed the computer because I will be going to college this fall. After having the computer for about a week I thought I'd share the pro's and con's to this laptop.<br />Pros<br />-Great Keyboard/Backlighting<br />-Fast processor<br />-8 gb of ddr3 ram(upgradable)<br />-Long battery life<br />-Relatively light weight<br />-Free windows 10 upgrade<br /><br />Cons<br />-Screen leaves a little to be desired.<br />-Trackpad can be under sensitive (at least mine is)<br />-Bloatware (all of which can be removed easily<br />-Slow hard drive, 5400rpm, shows it weakness when under heavy load.<br />-Build quality is lacking in the screen, does bend and warp if put under a slight amount of pressure. Other then that, the build quality is pretty average, not as good a Dell, but still pretty good.<br /><br />For the average user/student.<br />-I would say if you were buying this for a school computer or for a business this would be a great choice. For the average user this offers more than enough power to get you threw the day. If you aren't annoyed by occasional slow downs while opening apps, then this would be a great choice for you. And when the computer does start to show its age, you can always upgrade the ram, or the hard drive.<br /><br />For editing<br />-Like above this computer is fast enough to handle most editing/rendering software. ( Photoshop, Inventor, AutoCAD ect.)<br /><br />For Gaming<br />-This is the only category that this computer does not do well in. Unfortunately amazon has this computer under the gaming section of laptops. This computer is simply not made to game. I did test some games such as counter-strike go, the long dark, civ 5, insurgency, and of course Minecraft. If the game is from a few years back you can expect to get around medium settings and 30-45 fps at 1080p. This computer does have 8gb of ram and does have a gtx 840m 2gb (not really for gaming), but it also has a dual-core processer. Most games now are demanding a quad-core processer whichthis does not have, and is the only reason why it doesn't do well gaming. But if your kid wants to play Minecraft he can definitely do so on this laptop. But don't expect to be playing Battlefield 4 maxed out at 1080p.<br /><br />Thanks for the long read, if you have any questions do not be afraid to ask."
4.0,I'm 70 years it was difficult for me not to have a key board also i was charded over 20.00 more then i should. Have been l have bought three kindles in the past. This will be my last why coldn't my kindled be repaired.
4.0,"Bright and work well, no dimmer switch"
4.0,"Picked up this bright and handsome devil after my old and much abused Microsoft optical mouse started to get wishy-washy. Unlike the Microsoft, this bad boy has no trouble with my white melamine desk surface, and I was able to remove the grungy mouse-pad I had been using. The weight of the Manhattan is decent; light enough to work with all day but not so light that I feel my big ol' paws will crush it. Rubberized, textured sides make it easy to manipulate with a light touch, and the long, light cord has yet to snag on the nest of cables springing eternal from my system. The button-adjustable resolution is a nice touch, even though it's not too important for my uses. The only merph side is that there isn't a way to change the additional button functionality from the page forward and page back default. Not a huge deal, though, as the usual three button configuration meets my needs."
4.0,Good product at a good price. I am using it a lot.
4.0,Does what it is supposed to do.  Keep my kid from breaking the IPad.
4.0,"I really like it a lot. It fits my new 13&#34; MacBook Pro perfectly and looks pretty cool. I get compliments at every meeting or study group I go to. I can feel that it is there and sometimes if I'm doing a lot of typing, I will take it off because I'm not a great typist. However, I have dogs who shed a lot and also like to climb onto my lap (sometimes climbing on the computer) while I'm working. Plus I do snack sometimes so it's great to keep crumbs out of the keyboard. I like it a lot better than the keyboard cover that came with my iPearl case, which is floppier and has wider edges that overlap and make it easy to catch with my thumbs under the space bar. (I'm using that one for my desktop Mac's keyboard and will probably cut the edges some.)<br /><br />I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could, as I'm not sure my complaint is worth a whole star off. But I would really prefer that the letters and characters be clear instead of printed white over the colors of the cover. Mostly it's OK, but I do a lot of work at night and it would be nice to see the back-lit keyboard a little better. Especially the function keys, as I don't use them very often, so I have to stick my head down close and peer at the keys to figure out which key I want."
4.0,Great feel of the keys. Not 5 stars since I hate that the pen holder is just a sticker that you have to put. It could cone out at any moment.
4.0,So far is working like a charm.  Would have liked the option of a permanent Microsoft Office.  It took over 6 hrs. Working with a Microsoft Tech to download the software and trouble shoot the installation.  That's the reason for the 4 star.
4.0,"I like this product with one BIG exception. Every time you turn a page it flashes, and the flash it disturbingly bright. When using it to read at night in bed with the light on low as not to disturb my husband, it is almost strob like and after reading for an hour or so like I have been doing with my Nook, the flashing interferes with my sleep. I was happy with my Nook but wanted something with a longer battery life than what I had and was told that some of the books were cheaper on Amazon ( I have so far not found that to be true). I thought I would get used to the flash but it's not happening. Would not get this again.  Ok, I've been using this for a while now and played with all the settings. I still get the flashing bet in turning the page  refresh on and off a couple of times it now doesn't flash as  often. If anyone knows a way to stop it I would love to know."
4.0,"I never knew how dependent I was on my kindle until I couldn't charge it anymore!  The new cable worked!  However, I wish it was a faster charging cable like the original one that comes with the kindle.  I'm still happy with my purchase!"
4.0,works well and meets all my needs
4.0,"Works as advertised. A perfect replacement if yours goes bad, even if it's superficially a little different than the originally."
4.0,"Stiffer and thicker than regular, indoor Cat5e, but the jacket is very tough and the gel flooded construction bodes well for longer life in damp, underground installs.<br /><br />We've used nearly the entire box for five POE camera runs outdoors."
4.0,I have been very happy with this purchase. The keyboard is easy to use.
4.0,"The picture quality is a little crappy relative to my 1080p cameras, but still adequate.  Other reviewers claimed there was no IR cut filter, but mine clearly has it.  It goes completely dark in dim light.  It's not picking up IR at all.  The camera uses the exact same firmware as the Eyesurv ION NVR along with a host of other NVR/DVRs.  All the Chinese manufacturers seem to use the same software.  It is very confusing at first, but you can get the hang of it.  Since this uses the same software as the Eyesurv ION, they work together quite well."
4.0,"Not crazy about Windows 10, but I like the computer. Dell is the best! I have had an HP and a Toshiba, both were horrible. I just need to get used to the Windows 10."
4.0,"It is working fine.  The drivers software interface is a little odd, but it is working fine."
4.0,A little bit heavier than I thought it would be.
4.0,"older than I expected, but it works great"
4.0,"This captures beautiful video really easily. It can sometimes go half-idiot though and I have to replug it's USB, but it never happens during filming.<br />Other than it's nuances, this one's an excellent solution for a recording setup."
4.0,"5Ghz light isn't on but setup said it was active??? Otherwise, working ok."
4.0,"This card reader gets pretty good performance compared to the nominal ratings for the cards I tried in it.<br /><br />I was hoping that the part that swings around would act as a cover for the USB side when it was not plugged in.  It fails there -- the swinging part does not stay in position at all.  When in use, the part that swings around just gets in the way, and since it won't stay in place protecting the USB connector when the reader is not in use, I really don't know what good it does.<br /><br />At least the lid over the slots protects the cards.<br /><br />However, because the card is completely enclosed in this, high-performance cards tend to run quite warm.  I have not seen card failures from this yet, so I do not know how much it affects the cards.  The device itself gets warm too, even with lower speed cards.<br /><br />I do like that the light indicates activity."
4.0,"I have an iPad Air and I have been looking for something resistant but at the same time something easy to clean, transparent and easy to use with my stylus because I am a 3D Designer and I do a lot of sketching and drawing and other protectors aren't smooth enough, well I tried this Screen Protector and I love it! this is the second time I buy the product because is exactly what I was looking for. The Protector is easy to instal, even comes with directions and an applicator to put it in, and the other good thing than is coming with 2 protectors, very nice product with a high quality material! The only thing is than is a little complicate to follow the instructions but I installed it without following them. I received this for free, during a promotion, for my honest and unbiased opinion."
4.0,Does everything it's advertised to do and love the kick stand on the back. Made of sturdy materials should last life of phone
4.0,Cute cheap easy to put on !
4.0,Works fine if you need short male to male USB 3.0 cables
4.0,Pretty good case for a great price
4.0,"Easy to use cover, not bulky."
4.0,"This is a great tablet for what I was lookin for-one for my 7 year old. The Free Time is worth the money-no Netflix or other service needed. I like the parent controls and my kid likes the content. The battery life is awful and there isn't a way to close out apps, but that isn't a huge issue for us as I don't allow excessive screen time anyway."
4.0,good
4.0,"prefect! the wires are bunched very well, although a little stiff."
4.0,Very nice case for the cost. Fits the tablet quite nicely.
4.0,"I love, love, love the pattern, and it fits my computer perfectly. I love the non-stick feet and the texture of the case. I only wish it was less-transparent. The apple logo is visible when the computer is on, unlike the picture shows."
4.0,Works as expected
4.0,"So far it is performing as advertised. I would give it 5 stars, but the cables easily slide out and disconnect. The cables needs to be secured better."
4.0,-1 for the wait
4.0,"Good for the price, but not as reliable as our Netgear."
4.0,I never used this cover as gave the tablet to granddaughter. But it looked O.K.
4.0,"This is a good quality case, but it slips off of the screen too easily. It's annoying to have fix it frequently."
4.0,"I have had the product for a week or two now and it was acting just fine, and it still is for the most part.  My only issue with it in the rubber on the scroll wheel is coming off!  It isn't completely off, just barely, but it is enough that it irritates me while scrolling.  Other than that it seems decent enough."
4.0,Gave as a gift. Don't know if its good or not. Sorry. I received it. Since I haven't hear from my daughter I'm assuming it works.
4.0,good
4.0,I love this case other than the front door on mine doesn't clip in all the way but its good enough Great case to work in.
4.0,"I've already bought two. Very good product!<br />One I keep the Windows 8.1 and the other I update to Windows 10, both are working so far very well."
4.0,"I have been using it for a few months and its been pretty good, the keyboard isn't mechanical but it has its own character. The only complain I have is about the light as it is so bright, it wont be of much trouble in a normal lit room but in the dark its kind of annoying."
4.0,Cam on tie and packaging was fine. it swivels on the belt which cause me some concern.
4.0,Good choice
4.0,"Excellent product, worked exactly as described but unfortunately my phone is an LG800G and did not store the information I wanted to retrieve on the SIM card. Could not find anyway to transfer the SMS memory from the phone onto the SIM card so there was no way for this device to retrieve the information."
4.0,"Setup of this camera is not nearly as complicated as many of the online reviews make it out to be. It may have been more complicated in the past but port forwarding, fixed IPs, etc. are not necessary at all. I set up the camera in a few minutes with the manufacturer's Android app. It was plug-and-play simple. A QR code in the manual links to the app in the Play store (another for App Store for iPhone/iPad users). I had to set up an account for the app with the manufacturer - which allows for the connection between the camera and app to be made without worrying about network configuration. For set-up I had the camera plugged into the same router my phone was connected to by WiFi, and the app almost immediately found the camera. It recognized that the camera was new and automatically prompted me to change its password from the default password (a very good feature - numerous network security articles cite people not changing cameras off of their default passwords as a big security hole). I then used the app to configure the camera to use one of my wifi routers. Important - after configuring for wifi, it takes the camera over a minute to connect the first time. I thought it wasn't working, and tried a few different things - I just needed to be patient. Once configured it's good to go - pan, tilt. The Android app supports audio both ways - with a catch. It's not two-way at once, only one way at a time. The app allows selection between mute (no audio), listening to what the camera hears, or speaking into the phone and out the speaker in the camera.<br /><br />The camera is a standard definition camera, and the app provides the option of scaling down from VGA (AKA standard definition vide) to QVGA (1/4 the resolution) as well as different frame rates and or compression levels to allow you to choose between the best image, or lower data throughput if you're worried about blowing through a data cap with your mobile phone carrier. By todays HDTV and 4K resolution standards,this camera is very low resolution, considering the price point however, I'm quite fine with the image quality provided. I've been very impressed with how responsive the pan/tilt controls in the app are. Even when I'm on wireless data through my phone carrier, it's easy to smoothly position the camera.<br /><br />With its ring of IR LEDs, this camera sees just fine in a room that looks completely dark to the naked eye. It does well in an area where many &#34;night vision&#34; security cameras fall short - the IR LEDs light up the whole area that can be seen by the wide angle lens so you get the full picture. Many other cameras only light up a &#34;spotlight&#34; like area in the middle of their picture and suffer from tunnel vision in the dark, not this one.<br /><br />Network security concerns - This is what kept me from giving the camera 5 stars. Multiple articles online state that the camera transfers its password and wifi password without encryption - meaning that if your phone is on an unencrypted (like most free wifi hotspots) and a hacker is sniffing data in that location, they might get the password to look through the camera and the password to get on your home wifi system. I haven't monitored traffic between the app and camera to see if there is encryption, so I'm not trusting that it's been added. With this possible risk, it's a good idea to take some extra precautions. If your home router offers a guest wifi option, have the camera connect through that - this keeps it isolated from other machines in your network, and if someone does sniff out the network password all they can do is leech free wifi if they are at your house - and of course don't put the camera where it can see something you don't want anyone else to see. Since we use the camera to monitor dogs being trained for a local boxer rescue group, we just set it where we want it, plug it in when we are using it and put it away the rest of the time - Simple and easy.<br /><br />$15 rebate - A business card packaged with the camera offers a $15 rebate if you &#34;Leave an unbiased Product Review&#34; on Amazon. Other reviewers have said the offer is only for 4 or 5 star reviews, but the card in my package made no specifications about the number of stars. So, if you're willing to write a review - you're looking at an additional $15 off.  I purchased at $44.95 with free Prime shipping, the rebate takes it down to $30. It's not the most impressive IP camera, but it's really a whole lot of features and performance for only $30."
4.0,Very good keyboard for the price. Watch out for the elusive enter key though. I'll miskey / instead of enter every now and then
4.0,Recommended 100 % excellent product
4.0,Hold charge for about 2.5 hours.
4.0,"Great protection from dust, & dirt but space bar sometimes unresponsive...."
4.0,"It took a while to find a backpack/briefcase that truly could do both functions well; that is, look like a real briefcase when held by the handle or strap and also open flat.  It is well-designed and numerous zippered pockets are a big plus.<br /><br />However, I agree with other reviewers that it does not appear to be well constructed.  The key clip broke off the first time I used it, and the handles are just sewn in.<br /><br />One other minor thing:  It squeaks a bit when worn as a backpack, as the top of the straps move against the top of the pack."
4.0,Good product with reasonable price.
4.0,good value
4.0,Order a new one. had to send back the used one i bought.  - used one didn't even charge.  the new one can charge my iphone 6 up to 3.5 times fully before having to recharge.
4.0,Easy case to work with.
4.0,It charges the device as I need it to... works well.
4.0,Great product

4.0,"I got it in the mail today and I have to say, it gives my Macbook Air a whole different look. Its glossy and hardcover/plastic. Fits great, and it IS InCase. I thought it might be another brand... but no. I was surprised. For the price, its a great buy. I hope never to drop my Macbook, but if I do, I hope this does the job!! I'll be sure to return if thats the case. *No pun intended* :)"
4.0,"ok，i am from china.for saving $100，i choose amazon us.i would just state its disadvantages here.<br />1.touchpad is sticky because of its smooth surface design，which make fingers painful to use.i prefer my old lenovo's dotted one<br /><br />2,the speakers is worse than a pair of small speakers which worth 5$.As i suffer from ear problems，i am thinking about a purchase of cheap speakers instead of using earphone.<br />in contras，my lg g4's musical playing performance seems perfect，haha.<br /><br />3.GPU is good.But you know，you cannot get a little horse pull a heavy car.CPU doesnt match the gpu，and my imagination.i cannot even play CSOL ( ´▽` )But its power is enough for daily use.Before buying，i have fully understood this weakness，having mental preparation（given  its price）.And i hope you so.<br /><br />4.warrAnty  only 1year .<br />while on microsoft.com us ,the same price, 3years<br />.and in china  2years with  free led screen replacement in case of bright dots.<br /><br />above all，i cherish this purchase experience and the laptop，which will accompany my next 4years college life.<br /><br />thank you  for reading .Panda Wu"
4.0,best buy - good deal and the best AC adapter
4.0,"Very quiet but not as powerful for one of the few 360mm in the market right now. For $140, it doesn't come with rgb lighting or any lights for that matter or the software to control these fans. It is well constructed however and keeps my overclocked 4690k @4.5ghz @ under 55C under heavy loads (which is actually just 5-6C less than my hypo evo 212 cooler ). i wish it had a stronger pump but then it would be a little louder so there's that.<br /><br />I give 4/5 BUT would not buy again"
4.0,"works extremely well with elite dangerous, more than enough buttons and all are well placed. my only gripe is that the throttle has a &#34;bump&#34; at 75% forward and reverse, which gets very annoying, i ended up upgrading to x55, and kept the 52 as a backup"
4.0,I like everything about it except that I don't think the battery lasts as long as my other one did.
4.0,Good
4.0,East to put on but leaves an edge short of exact screen size for original paperwhite
4.0,I had done a lot of research before using this case so I knew what to expect fitment wise.  My only real complaint after taking the case apart a dozen times now is that when you undo the screws on the side plates you really need to be careful because they will just fall off.  Would be nice if like other similar cases I have used in that the front actually should fit snug in the slide.
4.0,Awesome
4.0,good for the price
4.0,"Nice, fast little &#34;phablet&#34;.  The screen is bright and crisp compared to other low cost Android tablets.  I used it as an HUD display for my car and worked perfectly."
4.0,"Good product, great communications of seller."
4.0,it serves the purpose i bought this chip for my daughter she says it's okay
4.0,I love the graphic on this skin but it has one problem. Each corner has a small slit so that it will fit well but the slit areas are lifting up after only one month on my laptop.
4.0,"This router works amazingly! I just wish it was a little sturdier and had some more weight to it. I had to tape it down. It is a great way to save $10 a month on rental fees from Comcast! Plus, this modem blows their modem out of the water!"
4.0,One of the largest USB drives I have used and it performs quickly and efficiently
4.0,Easy to set up and it actually does what it claims to do.
4.0,okey
4.0,"Easy to install and use using Widows Fax.<br />Just plugged into USB and Windows 10 installed without any problem.<br />Only Con - It does not come with a manual, and so far I have not been able to find one online."
4.0,all what I was looking for
4.0,Plays well with OSX... not sure if it's OSX or the adapter... but sometimes I need to restart in order for the connected drive to be recognized.  Used with CD/DVD/3.5&#34;/2.5&#34; all work well.  Speeds are max for USB2 spec.
4.0,"Just started using it with no problems so far.  Updated to Windows 10 before we started, so will know more in a couple of weeks."
4.0,Very reliable and versatile. So far I do not have any problem with it.
4.0,"Cheap, Functional! Good value for money!"
4.0,"works as it should, so far."
4.0,Works great...
4.0,Charges laptop fine. Wish jack was L shaped or a little longer like the original charger. I notice this one gets unplugged easier.
4.0,Nice has worked well for me withmy other electronics.
4.0,not bad. save your money and get the 8350
4.0,Shipped on time and item as expected.
4.0,"Very sturdy cover. Easy to access ports, speakers, etc. Highly recommended."
4.0,I have been playing with the Fire and seem to know how to do what I want it to do.<br />I really like my Fire.
4.0,takes a lot of desk space
4.0,Not what you except
4.0,Very nice
4.0,"I am enjoying the new keyboard, but the setup was a bit more than I anticipated.<br /><br />Coming from the flat, mac keyboard, many of the shortcut keys involving cmd were awkward for my reach. Also, the &#34;previous track&#34; and &#34;next track&#34; keys only worked in itunes. To remedy this few complaints, I downloaded Karibiner (it's a free software program) to reassign keys. A quick internet search will show how to reassign keys for those who may not be savvy.<br /><br />This keyboard was not &#34;out-of-the-box 100% compatible&#34;, but I am enjoying the keyboard now and I would recommend it to others.  Overall nice job."
4.0,"I bought it for use with my MacBook Air at work. Have no problem so far after 3 years. I do a lot of image analysis on computer, hence a lot of mouse clickings to get fine measurement, and the mouse is very handy."
4.0,"Works well most of time. However, it doesn't recognize all flash drives."
4.0,"Used bag - the bag itself and solar panel were fine, but the charger electronics had issues and couldn't be charged from the panel or the wall adapter. Given the massive discount (I got this for $180) given the bag retailed at $500 when new and the replacement model is $400, I was completely okay with this. I bought a new Voltaic v72 universal laptop battery and put it into the case. Still overall cheaper than the newer model, and I personally liked the aesthetics of the original better anyway. It's a bit of a bigger/ chunkier bag, since laptops at the time were bigger too. However, I'm 6 2&#34; and the compact replacement looks a little out of place on my frame. Additionally, should I want to carry some extra equipment with my laptop - like a wireless router or some portable spears - the bag has plenty of room to fit this comfortably."
4.0,Not crazy about silk. Would prefer another browser. Also can't link my Google account.
4.0,"This is a great bag at a good price. The colors and fabric are exactly as described. And the fabric is great at concealing dirt. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars, is that there isn't much room to carry your charge cord. When I have the charge cord in the bag, I can't zip it closed. Overall, it's a good product."
4.0,"For the price, I was surprised the camera and video works great. The sound isn't much to write about but it works  ... I'm happy with it. :-)"
4.0,"My mom loved this so much. The color was perfect, and it's still in pretty good shape. Bought it 2 years ago."
4.0,Works as expected.
4.0,Fine replacement. Dont expect big difference in battery life UNLESS you have many bad cells in your original battery.
4.0,"I like this screen cover, but it was impossible to get all of the bubbles out. Again, it is a great looking screen cover, you just might have to get a bit creative to get it completely smooth."
4.0,"For the cost, this is nice.  It feels just like the full blown windows and it's free to activate the windows license.  I surf the web and run GoToMyPC to grab other computers in the house.  It struggles with 1080 video streaming and it can't play 2D/3D games very well, but if you are using it for GoToMyPC and web surfing, it's great."
4.0,Does its job.
4.0,Just what I expected.  Packaged and delivered as indicated.
4.0,Great quality for the price. Would buy again.
4.0,"I suppose a rating of four out of five is pretty accurate since that's the number of cables that worked. One of the five did not. Had an open line. The others worked fine and looked well made visually. Came packaged very well. Have not taken the bad cable apart yet to determine exact cause of failure, just put it aside and went on with things. May do so later and update this review."
4.0,"I am very happy with this purchase.  I was originally looking for just a skin to give my macbook pro some personality, but decided on a hard shell case.  I wish I would have had it long ago before the time my son tripped over the cord and pulled my MacBook down onto one of its corners resulting in minor damage.  The shell has protected my MacBook well during a couple of other drops and slips since I put it on.<br /><br />The keyboard skin is very cute and I get a lot of compliments on it.  The only reason I took a star away to give only 4 stars is because the skin has a bubble in it and doesn't sit on the space bar as well as it could."
4.0,"I like it, except for the fact that it doesn't hold a charge for very long."
4.0,It was good except it was a little bent so it doesn't fit snug.
4.0,Worth the price but sometimes it has weird glitches and has issues with the storage. I bought a 32 gb SD card and the tablet still tries to use device storage! Extremely frustrating. I've even had it checked out and it just does its own thing. I constantly have to update it and delete alot of things off of it to leave enough roo  to use my normal apps.
4.0,I bought this for my 16 yr old. She loves it.
4.0,Well functioning. Fits 14.1 laptop very easily. Lots of space to put other things as well.<br /><br />One thing to note is - it is matt finish. Color looks a little dull as compared to the picture shown.
4.0,Drivers do not work for windows 7!  I tried downloading the drivers on windows 7 and my computer froze every time I tried to check for hardware changes.  I then upgraded to windows 10 and now it works great!
4.0,Mostly Good. I like the capacity though it does seem a bit in the slow side when writing a lot of data to it. It's working well as a backup drive for me.
4.0,good
4.0,Great
4.0,My iPad fits snug in the case and the strap really helps keep it together when I'm on the go. The case is very light and I can prop my iPad into portriat mode a bunch of different ways with the folds to watch shows and movies.
4.0,I accidentally ordered two of these one blue and one green.  I am currently using the green one and I especially like the fact that you can set it on your knee to read the Kindle books.  The camera had a shadow on the pictures I took and found out that the hole for the camera was a little off center  so I enlarged it by slipping it over the blades of scissors.  That is the only complaint I have about it and that problem was solved.  The Fire HD6 is kind of hard to handle because it is rather slippery  without this cover.  It fits nicely in my purse and protects the Fire HD 6.
4.0,it's an SD card.  Price was good. And it works.
4.0,IT IS WORKING WELL.  NO COMPLAINS.
4.0,Nice I liked it will buy from this company again
4.0,No problems and like it.
4.0,Bought for my granddaughter to take to college to use in her dorm. She was very happy with it but time will tell
4.0,Got what I expected. Seems to work fine.
4.0,Nice bright colors and good resolution in a reasonable price. Works for me
4.0,good product good price
4.0,You have to pirchase an extra piece in order to use it
4.0,"A pretty good mouse I like how easy it was to configure, and that theirs a button to lower and raise the sensitivity with a single button press. Only downside is I found the side buttons to be awkward to press down."
4.0,Nice stuff
4.0,good
4.0,Not fast but so useful... and discrete.
4.0,good
4.0,A reliable brand that we would recommend for everyone. We only buy either SanDisk or Kingston memory products.
4.0,works perfectly so far. Just wished the vga screw were easier to turn.
4.0,I would have given it five stars if it had a snap where the flap goes under so that the iPad can stay in place.
4.0,"Nice 10&#34; tablet here. I have enjoyed it. Only suggestion is better quality glass - this one scratches easy and needs to be cleaned often. Other than that, good value for the price."
4.0,"First off, these fans look amazing. If you want your computer hardware to shine and stay cool, these fans should do the trick. Both of the fans I purchased worked out of the box. But, I'm not sure if the screws are too big or the holes are too small, or both. I had some other fan screws that fit nice and snug, but the new ones didn't go all the way in, if you know what I mean."
4.0,"Love my new lap top so much faster than my prior one, but it was 10+ years old."
4.0,"The keyboard is fantastic, the mouse wasn't supper great but I had a different Logitech mouse so I just paired it with the receiver.  Love the shortcuts on the keyboard."
4.0,Very quiet and it keeps my cpu cool even under loads like gtaV
4.0,"It is well made and acceptable for male or female use. I ordered the item not knowing the dimensions as I was pressed for time.<br />It is 17X12X4.  I personally would have liked it better had it been deep enough to coincide with airline measurements (approx. 8&#34; deep--not 4&#34;) , thereby allowing for more &#34;stuff&#34;.  A change of clothes, toiletries, etc. will NOT fit in this bag with a laptop.  Also, the zipper to the main compartment only goes down as far as the shoulder strap attachments on the side (see picture). I would have liked the zipper to go further down allowing for easier insertion of the laptop."
4.0,Good deal for price using it to record my security cameras so far no issues.
4.0,Only had it for 3 day but so far I like it it worked right out of the box. Easy set up and easy to use.
4.0,I bought 3 of these. Great Price. All were new as described. SMART showed 0 hrs power on time and no faults.<br /><br />Why then 4 stars. Because you need to be aware that these are new old stock items. Manufacturing dates were between 2010 and 2011 so the WD warranty (2 years from date of manufacture) was expired on the drives I purchased.<br /><br />Overall am happy with these drives at this price. I will use them to clone C drives as backup on existing systems.
4.0,"This controller works very well. The phone holder grips my 5.5 inch phone pretty well and I'm not afraid its going to fall out if i move it around. The joysticks and buttons feel just like an xbox 360 controller, which is my preferred feel so I'm happy with that. The volume control is pretty handy since my volume controls are on the back of my phone.<br /><br />Some things I dont like are that the trigger buttons are not analog. They show up as a button in all the gamepad testing apps I tried. Not a deal killer, but it would be nice. Also, something I noticed is that the dead zone is a little big, and in some games like Geometry Wars 3, the aiming only goes to 8 points like an old arcade joystick. I'd be trying to aim precisely at an enemy, and if i only put the joystick from about 30-80% i had precision aiming, but if i went all the way to the edge of the stick it would start shooting like its aiming at the edges of an octagon. Its possible i could fix this with an app that lets you edit the sensitivity, but I don't know that for sure. Also, the D-Pad is really crappy. Its kind of spongey and I don't even feel good using it. Its crap.<br /><br />All in all, this performed good in the emulators I tried. And it works really well with my quadcopter sim. Id buy it again, but if you really need to have a good D-Pad, i would look elswhere."
4.0,I did fit the top part in my computer but the bottom part it did not
4.0,"Hey this is a great tablet, the best I know of for $99. I wish I would have bought the 16 GB instead, which is why I'm giving it a 4 stars. The unlimited cloud storage makes up for the lack a SD slot. I'm grateful for this product, it's fast, well build, and affordable."
4.0,Nice little tablet.  Works fine and holds a good charge.
4.0,I like it it is a little slow. I
4.0,As advertised
4.0,"I bought this case because I wanted a laptop case that will protect my laptop from scrapes and bumps while still showing the beauty of the MacBook. The feel of it is soft and almost rubbery but smooth enough to slide into bags without getting caught. The case seems sturdy and made of good quality, including the rubber pad things at the bottom. The case adds minimal bulk but it does add some weight to the laptop, but nothing too major to worry about. The problem with it so far is that it's hard to take off and I have not been able to take it off yet because I am afraid I will either break the case or scratch my laptop. It comes with directions on how to put it on and take it off but it just won't budge. Maybe I'm being too gentle? Another thing I have noticed is that it leaves oily looking prints from your hands on the case, even though I use my laptop only when my hands are clean. The MacBook does this even without a case though so it doesn't matter to me. Most importantly, it fits perfectly!! It snapped right on. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
4.0,"This case doesn't look as nice as some others but it does it's job very well. The case is durable and is built very well. My Passport fits inside it perfectly and the little pouch on the one side holds the cord well with some space for USBs if needed. I am very pleased with this case, I just wish it had more options for colors which is a purely aesthetic opinion."
4.0,Good quality. Bright color. Moderate protection.
4.0,Works just fine. No complaints here.
4.0,"I did a ton of research before purchasing this. I had an ipad that just stopped working, and wanted to get a replacement --with a little more umph. Something I could use for more stuff, etc.  The apple laptops would have been ideal, but couldn't shell out the bucks. So looked for a windows alternative.<br />Overall very happy with this; have had it a couple months. They major (only really) issue that I have is that it indeed does drop a wifi signal a little too frequently. I saw that on previous reviews, and figured it was probably a local wifi problem--and maybe it is, but it is a problem. Upgraded to windows 10 thinking that might help, but not really.  It's not a deal breaker, as all you have to do is sign off wifi and sign right back on, but it is annoying.  (If there is a fix to this problem Id love to know it!)<br /> Aside from that, love how you can use the touch screen or mouse pad. I'm not a super-user, using it mainly for browsing, occasional documents, etc .  Fix the wifi issue and this is a VERY good small portable laptop."
4.0,"Fits well, magnetic closures work fine but are a bit weak. Deducted one star because the front cover has a cardboard core, and begins to warp after a few months of exposure to humid air. If you live in a humid place, this cover won't last you very long! (same goes for most cheap tablet covers on amazon... they all use cardboard cores)"
4.0,A good solid tablet.could be brighter screen. But. Evertheless a good buy.
4.0,Works great. Upgraded to Win 10 and it's fast and quiet. If you are using this somewhere that you don't have an excellent WiFi signal then it's pretty well useless.
4.0,Excellent. Products arrived on time and exactly what I expected.
4.0,Love the Kindle Paperwhite. I wish you were able to change the text and background color.
4.0,"Perfect for someone with a small hand. Just plug in the remote sensor to the USB port and pair the mouse with mouse. Remember to press one of the buttons to wake it up after pairing.  I have this for a week now, it saves battery by automatically turn off the unit after a period of inactivity. (I did not time it.) You wake it up by pressing any of the buttons. Appears to be well built."
4.0,My husband bought this and said he likes it. He likes the clear window panel and fits his needs for mid size gaming tower.
4.0,"The Perixx AX-3000 7.1 Headphones offer many features found in more expensive headphones. The sound quality is good, they are comfortable enough, and the driver software gives extra customization. The only problem I had with them was getting the surround to work, no matter what I tried they always sounded like stereo. I dont know if they are faulty, or if my computers are incompatible with the driver.<br /><br />▌SOUND QUALITY ▌<br />Sound quality is better than I expected. Bass is audible as low as 25hz, and strongest at around 45hz, so explosions are nice. The deepness keeps it from overpowering the higher frequencies like &#34;bass boosted&#34; headphones. The mids and highs are fine, I EQed them a couple decibels. One thing I dont like is how loud the minimum volume, 1-10% is comfortable. The headphones reduce external noise, but not a lot. Maybe 1/3 - 1/2 as much as silicone in ear headphones. I can still hear my own typing, but mouse clicking is almost silenced.<br /><br />The microphone is not broadcast quality, but not to cheap either. It's loud and clear, there is no static or feedback in recordings, but I found in games I can hear a very quiet whine or hiss noise in the headphones. It's not audible when there is action, but it is when it's quiet, and it's only in games, not in windows. Adjusting volumes makes no difference.<br /><br />SUROUND SOUND<br />Here is where I have a problem, and I dont know if it's the headphones or my computers (all win7), in the playback devices I can only configure them as stereo. I can't get a surround effect. I tried 5.1 movies and 5.1 games, and I can hear all 7.1 channels, but they all sound like stereo. There is no &#34;virtually positioned speaker&#34; effect like what I get with Razers Surround software. The right, far right, and rear right channel all sound like the &#34;right channel&#34;. Changing the virtual speakers position also made no difference in where the side and rear sound was coming from. According to other people, these headphones are supposed to give a virtual speaker position effect.<br /><br />▌SOFTWARE ▌<br />The headphones are plug and play for the most part, but the driver software adds more settings:<br />- Volume control: volume, right/left balance.<br />- Sample rate: Choose between 44.1 and 48hz<br />- EQ: 10 bands, and different presets including custom saving.<br />- Environment effects: Make audio sound like it's in a big room, shower, cave, etc. Change size of room.<br />- 7.1 virtual shifter: Change the volume of each virtual channel, how &#34;far away the speakers are&#34; (didnt work for me though).<br />- Xear sing effects: Change sound pitch and echo of your voice.<br />- Xear surround Max: Seems to just amplify the sound into two channels for music.<br /><br />It does not work with realtek HD audio drivers.<br /><br />▌BUILD QUALITY ▌<br />The headphones are plastic and faux leather. They are over the ear style. The headband is faux leather, and has a really squishy cushion that I can't feel when wearing. The ear pads are also squishy and faux leather. They are comfortable enough, but could be a bit better. My whole ear fits inside them. If you wear glasses, they will be more secure on your head, but you dont really feel them.<br />The cable is 5mm thick, braided, and pliable. On the cable is the volume and mic control box which sits right above my crotch, I wish it was a little higher. At the end is a single gold USB.<br />The microphone comes from the left ear and is bendable which allows it to be perfectly positioned, or folded onto the headphones frame. On the tip of it is a red LED that turns on or off depending on if the mic is on or off via the button. The sides of the headphones also feature red LED lighting that always stays one, but isnt bright.<br /><br />Other Notes<br />If you dont get audio, go into the computer playback devices and change the headphones to the default. You can only get audio from them or your speakers at time. There a is a program online called Soundswitch which allows you to assign a hotkey to easily toggle devices.<br /><br />▌CONCLUSION ▌<br />Beside not getting the surround to work, and the minor microphone whine and minimum volume, these headphones offer some good features for the price, and I'm sure if the surround worked for me I would have been quite satisfied with them. Sample provided for testing and review.t time.

4.0,Thanks
4.0,Does it come with a cover?
4.0,could have been longer
4.0,The case is nice I did not read it all I thought when you closed the flap it would go into sleep mode this one does not.  I was a little disappointed that it did not.  I like the flap that lets it stand up right all in all it is a nice case for the Kindle fire.
4.0,"This is a high quality external RAID HDD.  It's fanless and runs practically silent.  Setup is easy and doesn't require any additional drivers or software.  Performance is very good, except at the heaviest loads.  Under full load for extended periods the conduction-convection cooling isn't quite enough and the drives hit their max rated temperatures; for this type of use (e.g. a full format or backing up large amounts of data) I add an external fan to blow some air across the unit to keep it at a reasonable temperature."

4.0,"I own three of these cameras and they are great.  The only slight issue I've ever had is the Wi-Fi connections seem to drop while my other devices (phones, tablets, etc) on my home Wi-Fi don't exhibit this behavior. I use the motion detection and I've had no issues with it. I would purchase again."
4.0,its on
4.0,"great product,great value  cons would be, product has a weird chemical odor that can be pretty strong.Hopefully it will dissipate with time. trying to fit a mini mouse and power adapter into the slim pocket causes a bump that if anything is placed on top might damage the contents of the pouch or cause the mouse buttons to continually be depressed. My mouse (TEKNET) also sold on Amazon and an awesome product at a great price with tremendous battery life (almost a year) and quality, uses a sleep mode function. After a set time interval of idle activity, the mouse sleeps and is activated by your initial press of the mouse buttons. With no provision in the case to isolate the mouse from external bumps or accidental depression of the keys, you can end up with a dead battery in the peripheral mouse which, when away from a replenishment battery, will leave you stuck with using the trackpad. Not a deal breaker, one might also opt to remove the mouse battery every time after use, but that is not an acceptable solution for me. The Amcase is lightweight, well made and exceptional value for the cost. Customer service from the manufacturer initiated contact with me after my purchase to ensure my satisfaction, that alone should tell you the Amcase people care about their consumers. I would consider this product a definite buy for the daily Chromebook user. I will definitely buy another for my next Chromebook."
4.0,It works as advertised​.  What can I say.  Amazon had a geat price on this monitor and the reviews were good so I tried it.  Sure is better than the Samsung I had before.
4.0,"The first keyboard that I received from Anker had problems. It was perpetually falling asleep and woke up when it felt like it.... Much like our teenage children... After posting a review here on Amazon, Anker went above and beyond the call of duty and took it upon themselves to send me another keyboard to replace the original I had bought. This time it works almost perfectly aside from one tiny glitch. Otherwise it would be a perfect replacement for the original Apple keyboard. The glitch it minuscule and most people will not run into it I'm sure. It deals with a 3 key sequence needed in Photoshop to 'step backwards' using alt-command-z. Photoshop doesn't recognize the command key in that sequence. I remapped that command with other keys so it's a non-issue. Otherwise, the keyboard 'feels' really good to use. Tapping the keys just feel much nicer than they did with the Apple keyboard! No worries of dead batteries like the Apple either though I'd still prefer the keyboard had a longer or user controllable time out. I'd rather recharge it once a week and leave it on and active 24/7 than to wait the few seconds for it to turn on. The new keyboard is much easier to wake than the last one. Service from Anker really was phenomenal. I give the company credit for their quick action to please a customer! For that reason alone, I'd recommend this keyboard. Enjoy!"

4.0,"The skin itself is amazing. It covers every possible spot on the system except for the thin top and side borders around the bottom screen, and is VERY easy to apply. I strongly recommend watching the instructional videos on their website. (No instructions for the skin come in the package, just instructions for the screen protectors.) You just need a hairdryer to warm up and soften the rounded edges and corners, and I didn't even need to use the 3M sheets. However, the corners still didn't go on smooth. All of the corners, except for the two at the bottom with the flaps, ended up with tiny folds. They aren't as noticeable if you push them down, but still a little annoying, and the corners are still bumpy.  As for the screen protectors... They're pretty much terrible. I'll be replacing them with a different brand. They come with a liquid solution that you're supposed to spray on your fingers and both sides of the screen protector, but it isn't very helpful and it's impossible to spray evenly. I feel like I might have been better off without it. I followed all of the instructions, but still got several large, noticeable bubbles that I can't get rid of. Not to mention you're putting a liquid onto your system and have to wait 12-24 hours before you can play it again. One positive: unlike some brands, the screen protectors ARE cut properly--top screen has rounded corners at the top, square at the bottom, and both protectors fit very well.  I'd say if you want a full-body skin armor, this is the best bet because it has much more coverage than any other brand, and my 3DS genuinely looks great now. (So much better than that ugly gray...) But you'll probably need to get a different set of screen protectors. The price is still worth it for me though, I LOVE this skin and now my brand new system will forever be scratch-free. :D  EDIT: DO NOT USE THE SCREEN PROTECTORS or risk damaging your lower screen! I just got replacement protectors so I removed these ones. The protector onthe top screen came off just fine, but the one on the lower screen was so stubborn that it was visibly pulling up on the screen itself. Don't use these screen protectors!"
4.0,Product as advertised... good quality... nicely flexible... worked good...
4.0,"Awesme, very useful."
4.0,Great
4.0,Works well with my iPad. Pairs without issue. Sounds good for small speakers.
4.0,What a great value and easy to use.  I bought this to backup my Synology Diskstation.
4.0,Good purchase!
4.0,if you like the Thermaltake brand (as i do) and you want the best head set out there this is the one to get. i think 100 bucks is alittle much / over priced but i wanted it soo...<br /><br />the software is easy enough to use but there are no videos on youtube or guides online to tell you how to set it up and i kinda wish there was because im not sure if im getting the most out of it (i have no idea how to set up sound stuff)... because honestly i cant even tell its surround sound.<br /><br />it looks sexy as hell though which is the real reason i bought it.
4.0,worked a needed.
4.0,"they work, they fill my office with tunage and they cost $15."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my dad, who has never used a tablet before.  The price is definitely right.  The storage is good for the price, and is easily upgraded with an SD card.  The tablet came with a charger and a screen protector.  Before we could get that on, the screen got scratched.  That was ridiculous.  So put your screen guard on first thing, because it scratched really easily from some sand on the table.  The camera is weak, but for $50, I wasn't expecting the best in the world.  I was sad that there wasn't a flash on it.  So far, he's enjoying the tablet and I'm enjoying him learning about newer technologies.  Thanks!"
4.0,"This is a nice keyboard, but it is extremely small and won't work as easily for people with bigger hands."
4.0,Handsome cover and protector for my iPad Air.
4.0,"Pretty good, I like it. Sturdy enough for my iPad mini."
4.0,Great product!
4.0,AAA+++
4.0,"It works fine. I use it for my car's usb input. Not suppose to plug a flash drive directly into the port, so I purchased this. Cheap and works."
4.0,Great for the price!
4.0,"Can't be beat for the price. A lot of claims about being under powered but I can run GTA V in full 1080P with mixed high and normal graphic settings. The only flaw, and is common for budget cards, is the fan is a little loud."
4.0,Great item. Look stronger than the one I previously had. Definitely recommend this item
4.0,Fits and serves its purpose....satisfied
4.0,My fault I couldn't get it on without trapped air. About to try and wash it and reapply.
4.0,Works better than expected.
4.0,"if it came with one more fan that wouldve been perfect, nice and sturdy. rubber pieces on the bottom to prevent static is nice"
4.0,"It works just fine, it just doesn't come with any decent software required to play the discs. Find a free one like Leawo until you can purchase a high-end program like PowerDVD."
4.0,"Bought this for my mother and she uses it all the time,mainly to play games and check emails,only thing is and with all tablets the charging cord is not long enough but other than that she loves it."
4.0,"Holds a hard drive well, but the bezel doesn't seem to be in the same place as it was on the cd drive.  Not far off but I can feel the overhang and it is a little irritating.  Not sure any other brand would be better."
4.0,Just what I needed. I want to hold my Ipad on a table to play music for a family get together and this will work great.
4.0,"The price was right,  I bought two of them,  Of course i'm wishing they'd last longer but in reality i'm not complaining.  They came quickly three day delivery was plenty fast enough."
4.0,colors change without my say so. but its awesome so who cares
4.0,"This is really a 4.5 star review. Fits the new Macbook very well and looks like wool. It does add a little bulk to the Macbook, as the seams take up about 1/2&#34; more room side-to-side in a purse than a naked Macbook. Still, it is lightweight, attractive, and affordable. I have no plans to use anything else."
4.0,Soved my problem when other products failed.  Great price too
4.0,"These are nice inexpensive IPhone 4S charging cable, the cable wirings are somewhat stiffer."
4.0,"It worked. Network speeds varied as per all wireless cards. There was a bit of warmth, again common with cards this size. Good design. the included software was easy to install and manage. If you need AC connectivity for an inexpensive price, or you are in need of upgrading a device that no longer has a functioning wireless car but has USB this is a good card to get,."
4.0,"inexpensive, functional drive for refurb or replacement."
4.0,"After about a year, this screen protector is going on strong. Way easy to apply, and a friendly company that will send you another one if something is wrong with the product. If you have trouble applying screen protectors and need a while to align them, this is the one for you! The special fluid that is of no threat to your devices, give you plenty of time to apply it."
4.0,Very nice product.
4.0,Looks great but beware:  It is very hard to put on.  My husband was able to get it on after I tried 3-4 times.  I was ready to send it back but he said they just fit really tight!
4.0,after having and using this for a while i definitely enjoy it. my only problem is that you have to have the volume all the way up and the base almost all the way up for the light in the sub to glow
4.0,This is the third one of these I've bought. Dog enjoyed eating the first two. The best value I've found for this item. No complaints at all.
4.0,"Fits device snugly, and appears to provide adequate protection from scratches."
4.0,Very large.  13&#34; wide x 11&#34; deep. But seems good so far.
4.0,Received today. Thank you !! Haven't had it long enough to write review but. Seems just what I wanted
4.0,"It did what it was made room do, no problem  at all."
4.0,"Fits my macbook pro 13.3 with a little extra room, so it would slide around inside when i carry it. The charger case is also a little too small to fit my cables and charger, so you might need to play with the angle you're wrapping the charger in order to fit it in.  But overall it protects my laptop and does it job! Soft inner lining. Well done"
4.0,ok. 4 star
4.0,"This was far tinier than I expected it to be.  In transferring large files, it went a little slower than I would have liked it to, but in the end, it got the job done, which is what counts.  For the price, it couldn't be beat."
4.0,I bought this specifically for gaming on my PC. Works as expected.
4.0,"Generally a good laptop.  The SSD makes the initial boot-up faster.  I currently have an issue with a down cursor key that periodically sticks (laptop arrived only 3 weeks ago).  I am in the processing of trying to get that problem resolved via warranty through an authorized Lenovo repair partner; if that won't solve the problem quickly, I may have one of their tech guys come to my house to fix the problem, which is most likely a keyboard replacement.  Not crazy about going that route as it will cost me $50 to have the tech guy come to my house even though the keyboard replacement is free.<br /><br />Wish the keyboard was backlit and the screen resolution was higher.  Other small annoying issues but with Windows 10 and Edge that on my old laptop with a lower Internet Explorer I did not experience (e.g. PDF files that won't open or even if they open, not able to print unless I save the file first) All in all, not a bad laptop.  May think about a gaming laptop next time to maintain the speed and better resolution."
4.0,"It's a very great case though on the edges it has started to fade😓that's really sad because I love this case and everything about it. Very protective, I have dropped it a little but it protected great"
4.0,"I needed something that could hold two laptops and then some. This fits the bill perfectly. I am holding a windows laptop and a macbook air in the main compartment with room to spare. Plus, it has another compartment and plenty of little pockets to put small stuff like cables, drives, whatever in. Plenty space and it looks great and feels well made. My only complaint is that it does not have a padded should strap."
4.0,Didn't work for my Samsung S4. Smh
4.0,"Most ergonomic mouse I've used, even better than those later in the series. Felt bulky at first, but became very comfortable and now I can no longer go back to a slimmer design. The buttons are all positioned perfectly as well.<br /><br />Some downsides: like other gaming mice, is prone to suffer from the random double-click after a period of time. The left mouse button has begun experiencing the issue and the only way to alleviate that without having to buy another mouse was to download a third-party program (search for &#34;Daniel Jackson MouseFix&#34;). It has helped prevent it from being too frequent, but it still pops up every now and then.<br /><br />The scroll wheel also stopped functioning properly after some time, for which there is no fix. Pressing down registers as multiple clicks; sometimes it must be pressed hard for it to register at all.<br /><br />Issues aside, the mouse would have been perfect."
4.0,"The cable is really good, does his job as espected. Mostly hidden.<br />I get some trouble when it was necessary to put in to the midle wifi router. Cutted and where surprised that I cannot put the connector back. Then cables is so small that I was not able to do it.<br />Dont cut it. Better buying less and having something in the middle."
4.0,Works great and it's not bulky.
4.0,"If you are not Overclocking, this is the best to go with."
4.0,"This is a great bag!  Material is cute and durable, far better than the boring black bags our local stores offered.  The pockets are the best part because I can store the mouse and cords easily.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I think the handles are pretty cheap. I would have paid more for real leather handles, or eliminated theme entirely because I just use the shoulder strap."
4.0,"Replaced previous one, screen protector seems a little &#34;loose&#34; compared to last one, it just doesn't seem to be as &#34;tight to screen&#34; as before. However it still functions well and is great for drops."
4.0,"Just with the keyboard also had a storage spot for the USB dongle. I know there is one in the mouse if you get the combo, but I just got the Keybaord. Otherwise it's great, and if you get the combo of mouse and keyboard you'll have that storage spot."
4.0,Excellent product fast enough because if you need something to put on your keychain then speed is necessary but not important. I just carry the documents that I need for class and work. I only wish it had a password protection feature like SanDisk.
4.0,"I would recommend this product as a replacement for the Lenovo adapter. I bought other types of these adapters, but they created static through the electronics in my home due to improper shielding of the adapter. To avoid this problem, buy the Lenovo adapter. It costs a bit more, but worth the money to avoid electronic problems and other people in the home complaining about the static!"
4.0,This has one of the best specifications and good looking. here is detailed review  at you tube on this.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RvvacxZuS0
4.0,We live in a small ranch and needed the wifi to get from the furthest point.  It works.
4.0,The adapter words good.
4.0,This saves me from paying rental to Comcast. It will pay for itself in less than a year. It was easy to set up - pretty much plug and play - with every penny.
4.0,Very good.. Which internet explorer was on it but other than very good
4.0,"I loved this bag! The problem that I had is that the shipping was almost 5 weeks....<br /><br />I needed it for a trade show and had to make due with the older bag that I was trying to dump. Everyone who sees it loves it (if you are into that kind of thing) as well as being small ,compact and light."
4.0,"I have used the old TURBINE Bluedios and I loved them, they are better quality than most other over ear headphones but they broke during the first 2 months I had them so I hope that these don't break easily like the older version of bluedio headphones I had."
4.0,Thanks
4.0,Works as advertised. Plenty volume for size. Sounds ok. Recharge seems shorter than 4hr use time. Bluetooth connects easy.
4.0,I love it so far except 4 stars due to my adaptive lighting does not seem to be working?? I have set it up to use this feature.<br />HELP suggestions appreciated!
4.0,i love the case but sometimes it falls over and is hard to stand up without support other than that  the case is perfect
4.0,I boug
4.0,I thought it was larger which was really my fault for not measuring but it's just too small for my taste
4.0,great deal
4.0,Fast and strong.  It should have come with rubber accessory for free.  Comes with one usb cable.
4.0,Tools that come with it are junk but cable is great!
4.0,So far my daughter has not torn it up only issue I have found is can't find screen protector for it or a good strong case to hepl lee kids from destroying it
4.0,"I must have missed that this was for a macbook pro, because only the top fits over my macbook air - but I still use it because I it's too cute not to."
4.0,"Awesome for computer and 360. Had to download something to read the controller, other than that, really can't complain."
4.0,"Worked out Great! I had an expensive Smart Cover that fell apart so I didn't want to spend $40 dollars on a new one. This case easily snaps on and works for what I need, a simple cover and stand. The only con is the auto on off doesn't work as well as an actual smart cover but for me that was no big deal as I set my iPad to auto shut off if not in use. I will buy again if I need too and it is well priced."
4.0,The product was fine. Nothing was wrong with it. As the dimension was not mentioned it did not fit to my iPad which is 24 cm by 17cm (9.6 in by 6.8 inch). I still want to buy the same product with the  size of my iPad.
4.0,"I like this tablet so far.  I bought this for my 2 little boys to use in the car to watch youtube/netflix movies on/off line.  I happen to have an extra phone line with Tmobile with 10gb data per month so I may as welll use it.  It is of course no iPad quality, screen not as bright, so so resolution, and a little slower than I am used to with other high priced device, but it serves what i need right now.  I installed sim card and it connected with the right APN settings for 4G LTE automatically (I called Tmobile to make sure that is right setting for their fastest speed).  I am sure the kids will love this new age &#34;car entertainment system&#34;.  I can load a bunch of movies onto micro sd card and they are set for long road trip."
4.0,I use this as my technician flash drive with my favorite live CDs and applications for system and network repair. It's faster than others in this price and size. I put it on my keychain and its been holding up fine.
4.0,Very good!
4.0,Great little case for my mini 3. I love the color also.
4.0,Good
4.0,This cable is very well made and is well suited for it's intended purpose.
4.0,"did not ocme exactly how it look like in picture the buttons &#34;w,s,a,d,up,down,left,right&#34; are all blue."
4.0,Nice device and my husband complains that it covers up the charging area.
4.0,It does what it's suppose to - protects the tablet.
4.0,good
4.0,"This tablet is well worth the money. It runs pretty smooth with the android operating system. The colors are decent but not compared to a high end tablet. This is perfect for everyday email, social media, and video streaming/games. Would also suggest buying a case for it."
4.0,Case fit perfectly.  Easy to snap on.  Could be a little thicker but that would add to weight of tablet.  Although it does not allow you to fold completely into tablet mode it's no more than a 1/2 inch off.  If you really need it flat remove one side of cover without a hassle.
4.0,"Works great. It is easy to use, even for my tech-averse dad, to whom this was given as a gift. The only hiccup we have had was when a device in the hub prevented the computer from shutting down and/or caused it to wake up. The lights on the hub helped diagnose the problem, so kudos on the product design."
4.0,"A bit expensive, but does what it should. I run two Zyxel access points off these and they work with no problems."
4.0,"I use this to switch between my Mac's internal mic and my headset's external one. I do an internet radio show to hook up with the Skype-like (not Skype) connection Blog Talk Radio uses. Otherwise, pre-show, I have to completely shut my computer down, plug in the headset and reboot in order to switch to the external headset and mic. (And then, again, to switch back after the show. It's a huge pain.)<br /><br />This unit takes care of that problem. But that's all I use it for and half the time I just use my iPhone and Bluetooth headset/mic because it still fails at least half the time. Honestly, I don't know if it's the station of the Belkin product that's the problem. It's probably the station because I use Skype all day every day in my work and can switch between headset and &#34;regular&#34; without any rigamarole.<br /><br />So - I'm pretty sure this does what I need it to, but I did have to fiddle with it quite a bit. It could use longer cords and it would be nice if it came with a power adapter."
4.0,Sturdy and works well.
4.0,"the product arrived in a timely fashion, easy to install as I read on youtube that the provider would acknowledge instantly with no phone calls. this happened without incident. I seem to have lapses in internet service and have not determined if it is the box or provider. when the lapses occur my tablet and phone, also connected, work fine. this purchase was to compliment my new dell all in one touchscreen computer so I haven't suspected the computer but wonder if the right purchase may have been a separate modem and router."
4.0,I connected three separate cables to three separate couplers and it streams perfectly still! Definitely recommend.
4.0,Fits good on my daughters iPad 2 and offers good protection. Only issue is the fold out kick stand is pretty hard to unlatch from case and she is usually not able to do it.
4.0,"I gave this as a stocking stuffer - the reactions it gets range from &#34;ewww&#34; to &#34;cool&#34; to &#34;that's pretty funny&#34;. It is realistic looking enough to make people do a double take. It seems to work well. Overall a good, inexpensive gag gift."
4.0,"Seems sturdy so far, no issues."
4.0,"Product arrived on time.  Probably not the studies sleeve, but it gets the job done.  Fits my HP ENVY 17.3 perfectly"
4.0,"Good basic webcam.  I'm using it with a RaspberryPi running MotionPie as a security camera.<br />The LED's are not Night vision infrared, they are just white lights like a flashlight.  They're pretty useless."
4.0,Great computer for college.  Wish that it came with word.  Also some freezing/glitching issues.
4.0,So slim !
4.0,"I like it. I had a Kindle fire which lasted several years, so my expectations are high. So far it's been fine. I have noticed playing games it has a tendacy to not respond to touch at times. It passes seconds later but could cost you the game depending on what game you're playing. I have no other issues with it."
4.0,"Like the tablet and what it does, but its quirky and that is frustrating.  Especially concerning startup."
4.0,"Just what I expected having seen my friends with the same case.  Reserving the 5th star because I think it is overpriced compared to the un-Apple equivalents, some with nice features Apple's doesn't have."
4.0,I'm not sure that the quality is as long-lasting as an Apple product.  but it worked well on several older devices mating the new I phones with the lighting connector to the speaker box.
4.0,The mp5 player looks good! I hope i like it and it works for me! I would hate to have to return it.
4.0,Works as advertised. It would get 5 stars if it came with some 2-sided sticky tape to permanently affix to my imac base.
4.0,I bought this not sure how it would work.  Works fine in our microsoft surface.  Only problem is the lead is too short.
4.0,So far so good.  Wanted a small reader that could also be used to access my e-mail and this looks like it will fill the bill.  Will be able to travel and leave my laptop at home.  Love that it has a USB port.
4.0,"I liked everything about this Modem except for the blinking green light that never stops blinking. At first I thought there was a problem with the Modem so called Comcast and they said it's normal, that the blinking light indicates it is receiving data from Comcast. Funny thing though is the Modem I was renting from Comcast is almost identical to the CM820 but it didn't have that annoying blinking light and there is no way to make it stop blinking."
4.0,Lasted a whole lot longer than the tablet it was meant to protect (Hisense Sero 7 Pro).
4.0,What can I say about a power adapter? It works as expected.
4.0,Does the job as supposed to.
4.0,It works well. The only problem I've seen so far is that it is a slow. It requires much longer time to copy in and out compare to a standard USB flash drive.
4.0,"Covers, protects, fits well. Tends to slip on smooth surfaces when using horizontal."
4.0,"its not 5 stars because the battery life sucks. once in a while i have problem connecting while wireless. mine is still in perfect condition after 1 whole year of use and i game a lot, but its just the connection issue and battery life issue."
4.0,"This bag is the perfect size for school. I can fit my notebooks and laptop with no problem. The side pockets can fit a small water bottle, but it would probably stretch it out. The only reason I didn't give this bag 5 stars is because, the cross body strap is cheaply made. It would break with the amount of stuff I carry"
4.0,reasonably priced.
4.0,Works great and you can't beat the price. Love that the cable is soft and flexible.
4.0,Very nice
4.0,Works great. 4 stars because the USB3.0 slots will only work with a USB3.0 board.<br />Would probably work better if it was installed via PCI Express instead of using USB slots directly on the board.
4.0,Works just fine.
4.0,"I have a love-hate relationship with screen protectors.  I cannot help but get frustrated when installing them.  They attract dust, yet the goal is to avoid dust getting under the screen protector.  I swear that is why they always sell you more than one at a time.  The first one just collects all of the dust so that the second one has a chance.  I was very frustrated after the first one, but with the second one there was only one speck of dust and the usual air bubbles.  I was able to work out most of the bubbles right away and thought I could live with one bubble around that spec of dust.  To my surprise, all of the bubbles in the display area are gone, a few minor ones near the edges, and the bubble around the dust is so small I have to strain to find it.<br />Pros:<br />You get two so that hopefully one of them makes in on without too much dust under it<br />Does reduce glare<br />Only marginally affects tactile response of touchscreen<br />Appears to work bubbles out on its own<br /><br />Cons:<br />You'll be cursing at how much dust it attracts.<br />I'm not an expert and I can't do a side-by-side comparison, but I think there is a little loss in clarity, but I knew that going into it and I think the glare reduction is worth it (glare was a distraction for me).<br />The cloths that came with it are poor. Use others<br />Don't use the tape they provide to try to pull dust off of anything - it left adhesive marks on my screen and failed to remove the dust from the protector.<br />Don't keep pulling up the screen protector to try to remove dust, see point above<br /><br />Oh, and shipping only took like 2 weeks from China, so not bad and well ahead of the planned delivery date."
4.0,Good price point but was going to be too slow for my build so I had to return it.  Great chip for a cheap media server.
4.0,It's pretty good.
4.0,"Works as intended, but cheaply made. The threads aren't super clean, and the plating seems cheap, but I haven't had any issues over the last 4 weeks."
4.0,"The monitor has great video quality, I jus wish I would have purchased the 27&#34;"
4.0,"At first I had some issues, did a hard reset and the modem is working fine now"
4.0,"Excellent quality and performance.  The only downfall - No ability to use your own choice of DNS server (ie openDNS). Truth be told, I would not have purchased this modem had I known this."
4.0,Works just great
4.0,"Assembling this....... was a little tricky. But eventually I got moving with the instructions, together with the internet. I can't say that I'm impressed with the cooling ability. I expected my temperatures to be lower (& I'm not OC btw)."
4.0,Not quite as sturdy as hoped but only one I could find of this type
4.0,I bought one of this tablet for my 1year old son. It is a very good tablet for the price and it is easy to use for a child. Only problem is it doesn't have bluetooth connectivity.
4.0,"This is a pretty well made case, albeit a Chinese import. It's semi-rigid, fits the WD Ultra drive perfectly, has two sections to divide your properly secured drive from its cable and has a reliable zipper. Aside from a lower price, there isn't much more to ask for. However, I still would not recommend carrying around any hard drive (which has movable parts) with precious data on a regular basis. A flash drive is a much safer alternative for that."
4.0,My son loves it but it eats batteries. Probably have to change twice a month. But it does get heavy use. And you can turn the lights off on it to save battery.
4.0,"Very durable. Out of all ipad cases I have purchased, this is the only one that has held up against my toddler. The handle makes it easy for him to carry. The only issue is that it is very difficult to get the ipad in and out to clean. The rubber has stretched from me trying to pry it out."
4.0,EXECELENTE EN OPTIMAS CONDICIONES
4.0,Functionality is what I wanted and received
4.0,"Great tablet/laptop. Wish it had at least 2 USB ports but I guess I can spend a little and buy a hub, and also a external DVD/ blue ray drive. Great purchase would recommend it for anyone who needs a tablet but also needs a full on Windows system."
4.0,Good product.
4.0,Good cover perfectly fitted the board
4.0,Convenient if you SD port is acting up.
4.0,Still getting used to it.
4.0,"It charges my phone,  I was looking for something that would charge my tf101 tablet.  guess I clicked and ordered the wrong thing. but there is always room at my house for another microusb 2 amp charger"
4.0,"I was having a lot of dropouts and slow speed issues using my Comcast modem as a router, blogs I read seemed to indicate that the problem is typical of combined devices. Plugging this into the Comcast modem solved all my problems.  Solid signal throughout the house."
4.0,just unboxed this produce. looking great
4.0,Works well. Charges faster than the OE one. Not crazy about the offset plug or 90 degree plug on the other end. Both of those features can cause it to be a bit awkward to use. But otherwise it's fine.
4.0,"Extremely lightweight and comfortable, but after about a year the mic started to cut out with no visual external damage. As it turns out, there are some pretty flimsy connections inside of the headset where the mic wires are soldered in."
4.0,IT&#34;S KINDA CONFUSING. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET FROM THE PAGE I'M READING TO THE KINDLE STORE
4.0,Great buy and durable.
4.0,It was just as expected
4.0,Second one like this my son wanted another for his school books.  Has lots of pockets and he can carry his large laptop to class. Last 3 years carrying large books and a laptop.
4.0,Nice unit arrived very fast does what it says on the tin
4.0,A bit over priced. Working well tho.
4.0,"My 15-year-old son built a computer for me and said this case was a good, basic one in part because of the built-in cooling fans. So far, the case is doing it's job"
4.0,Super affordable has been working great for the past six months. Little unstable when propped up - but well within my expectations.
4.0,"Not bad overall the stickers were good , some were not PC or for younger children so adults may need to filter some of them are adult orientated.<br />."
4.0,"As expected, connection with extender is slower. But my husband is happy he can listen to Pandora in the garage now."
4.0,I broke it it was ok
4.0,Fits well. There's thick white line on just one letter/button but tolerable.
4.0,Product came promptly as specified.  A good experience
4.0,So times this fly's when transferring data to it and sometimes it is slower than all hell. I don't know if it's my computer's USB 3 port acting up or this portable drive. It is nice not to have to plug it into a wall outlet like the old backup drives.
4.0,After finally getting my first pair i learned quick that what most people say is true. You never truly experience a game unless you have used a sound system or gaming headset these px21s are no exception. Comfortable great sound. this one is my second pair sadly due to little cousin ripping the cord on my old one. So to me it was worth the purchase again
4.0,It's exactly as pictured and protects the notebook. I recommend.
4.0,Worked great!
4.0,I'm a newbie at CS:GO and it already made  a difference.
4.0,"I rate the keyboard with 5 Stars, but the clips that holds the tablet on 4 sides of the case, I rate it at 3 since the way it is designed, those could break after several times the tablet is attach and detach from the case.  Besides, the upper lefthand clip is situated on the volume control of the Insignia Tablet/PC that could disrupt the volume at any given time, while in use.  The case itself, I rate it at 4 Stars.  The price is fair."
4.0,Works really good. The wire looks sturdier than the apple charger. The product received had some yellow stains on it but that didn't matter it charges my phone and for the deal it was a must get.
4.0,good replacement for old cable modem. Does not disconnect as often as the old one.
4.0,Charger arrived very quickly and works just as advertised
4.0,I really like the kindle fire. The size is great since I'm only really using it for text book and internet. I do wish that I had access to the Android play store and google apps. That would have made this tablet a 5 star for me.
4.0,Good
4.0,Worked great... Ultra quiet... Comes with hardware and adapters for any occasion...
4.0,"Beautiful bag, only thing that could be better is the depth of it. Loads of pockets, leaves less space for larger items. All in all, great bag at great price. Highly recommend."
4.0,"This otterbox case is everything I hoped it would be and more, because while it provides all the usual protection I've come to expect from Otterbox it also looks good. My iPad mini 3 fits into it well with a little coaxing of the rubber at the corners. The device is very securely held inside. The wrap around protective cover has a very pleasant soft feel and closes with a magnetic clasp. It has a book like appearance. The case may have a little heft to it but it also fits easily in my purse and is easily carried around. The only negative for me is that when the case stand is used to watch a movie the magnetic clasp doesn't fold quite flat enough so obscures a small part of the screen. It wasn't too hard to figure out how to keep it out of the way but I'd be happier with the case if that wasn't an issue."
4.0,Seems to work well though the range is not as good as my linksys. But i was not about to pay another 20 just to have them readjust whatever was alowing stuff down. Though i will say the customer service for this router stinks. They do not speak english well at all and i basically just gave up. The lady email me exactly what she told me to do even though i explained it still was telling me it wasnt able to configure correctly. But my internet still works and seems a tad faster then with the older router.
4.0,It's a good replacement. But sometimes is warm when it is charging my laptop.
4.0,Good replacement. Didn't want touch screen but getting used to it. Works great though. very clear
4.0,"I love this case, but there is a small possibility for slippage of your ipad when it's fully open. I'm very careful about that. But I would buy it again."
4.0,"Great service and quick delivery.  However the product itself, though compatible with my laptop, can only charge to 95% and does not seem to provide the same charge life as the OEM.  Suits my purposes though."
4.0,"I bought two of these shell cases: the green & the red. Items arrived quickly (in 5 days). The covers snapped on in seconds & fit perfectly. The colors were a little bit off from the seller's pictures. The green is more like lime green & the red, as one reviewer said, is more of an orangey red. Not that big of a deal. Quality is okay. [[ASIN:B00QH8PCA2 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Green)]] and [[ASIN:B00QH8S5R4 iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6&#34; Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-111 series Laptop (Red)]]"
4.0,"Works very well for a non-power user.  Plenty sufficient for browsing, viewing videos, etc.  No need to spend more."
4.0,"This is a basic case, that get the job done at a low price. As long as you are not expecting any frills, it's great!"
4.0,Awesome for reading. Only  problem although you can read PDFs it's not possible to download this kind of file.
4.0,It works fine and somehow saves my laptop from being overly hot. My laptop still goes hot on it but it's much better than without it.
4.0,"So it will increase the range you recieve by a lot.  I live in apartments and the router is all the way down the hall. 100-150&#34; through multiple walls ect...before I was getting only 2 bars and not enough signal to even get on Amazon or Facebook, couldn't complete a speed test or anything.  So I got this product installed the drivers and thats where everything went wrong. (8/28/2015) The CD that comes with this device works, but it slows your internet down so much and I don't know why.  With the meditek ui I was getting random signal and very low throughput transmitting.  Now the signal before this was horrible, and with the drivers I could barely watch a youtube video, and facebook barely loaded. I know this is due to interfernece and stuff but hey I got this for that reason.   (8/29/2015) After doing some tests with my laptop (almost 6 years old) I was getting better consistent signal.  So I plugged in the adapter and got the same results.  Now I installed the software and I got random signal drops among others.  I know it scans frequently but so did my other programs.  Good antenna, but horrible software that comes with it.  Also had to use a TCP optimizer before the transmitted throughput would stay at a reasonable level. May end up returning and use laptop as wifi antenna since they both pick up the same strength of signal, except my laptop doesn't randomly disconnect from the internet.  (8/30/2015) Well was able to get one decent night out of this device, but for the price the struggle isn't worth it.  Still random dropped connections, 1Mbps to 72Mbps received and when it's 50-70's it works great, but usually has to restart.  I've decided to return this Monday and I'm either going with a different antenna or I'll be switching internet packages."
4.0,Great small memory flash card and just what I needed for my phone.
4.0,Not all tv will work as dvd player
4.0,Bought this for more storage for my xbox one. And it works perfectly
4.0,It is too heavy.
4.0,"The name isnt wrong, it is silent. However, it only has one of the sets of holes to mount to your case. Sadly, the front of my case only had the other set, making the fan seem incompatible. Ended up using zip ties to mount it, haven't had any problems yet."
4.0,Some of the letters have worn off after about a year of use.
4.0,Works well perfect replacement.  Works like new!
4.0,"Everything fits! Haven't had any issues yet (no cracks) and I love the color! The keyboard skin doesn't line up with the letters exactly and it's noticeable only when the backlight is on, but it doesn't bother me too bad. I'd probably order this again, just without the keyboard skin."
4.0,"Same as any cheap wifi dongle, great price, troublesome linux drivers. So sad... They are automatically recognized in linux, but the drivers are unstable."
4.0,"Everything was great, arrived on time and install was a breeze. Works with my PlayStation 4 as intended."
4.0,"Totally satisfied with display right out of the box -- color, brightness and contrast are great.  Will probably play with customization later, then again may not bother.<br /><br />Installation was annoying.  Comes with the now-common 1-page sheet with pictures on it and no written instructions.  I disconnected old monitor and plugged in new one, the background graphic popped right up.  But that was all.  No icons or taskbar.  Put in installation CD and nothing happened.  Opened File Explorer to try to manually run set up but still nothing on screen except the background.  Fortunately had a laptop handy so was able to access the User Manual on the CD.  Its install instructions mentioned that it was important to turn on computer AFTER turning on the monitor, something the simplistic pictures on the Quick Start Guide didn't even hint at.  But that was the solution, this time screen came up normally with icons and all.<br /><br />Running the Viewsonic setup went smoothly until last step.  Got message that drivers couldn't be automatically installed, needed to do it manually.  Going into manual setup though, only option it gave me was to install Windows 7 & Vista drivers.  I'd recently upgraded to Windows 10, suspect this was the reason.  As everything seems to be working fine with whatever default drivers it's using, not a problem.<br /><br />Checked Viewsonic website to see if I really needed Win 10 drivers.  Couldn't get into their drivers download page, kept getting sent to a page-not-found screen which even mentions one reason you're there might be because they moved the content somewhere else.  Now hoping I never need to deal with their Tech Support."
4.0,This worked well with my NuVision tablet even though it was made for a different style. I don't use the rear camera on my cheaper tablet so it didn't matter to me that it doesn't match perfect.  I'm sure with the right tablet it would be even better.
4.0,Great receiver but you might need to look up videos on YouTube to see how to set it up
4.0,Seems fast.  Wish it had an activity light.
4.0,"Why I made this purchase: Needed something smaller than my backpack to take inside my workplace. Pros: Manageable size fits two AC cords, a sandwich, keys and my Kindle, and I don't look like I'm carrying a purse. Cons: Dislike faux straps and small snaps on lower straps that are labor intensive to secure the flap. But this is not a deal breaker. I would purchase again."
4.0,Pockets could use a little more room. If you use the front pockets with anything bulky the flap won't stay shut with the magnets. Very protective case and overall I like it. Very nice looking
4.0,"This tablet had tons of potential with all the options of higher end models. We purchased this for my daughter's 8th birthday and she was able to download her games, play, browse the internet with no issues. There is no google store option but the Amazon app we downloaded was just as good if not better. The screen was a clear display and she even watched Netflix on it all the time. I was surprised it was able to handle playing games like Minecraft! It was simple to connect to Wifi and never had connectivity issues. It worked great for the first year or so than she cracked it. I would assume she would still be playing on it if it was broken."
4.0,"Love it!! Very seldom does it give me any problems but, it was definitely a good buy. I can't seem to put it down because I am constantly reading. The apps I downloaded are great and work perfectly. I highly recommend it. *Be warned that it is small but don't let that defer you from purchasing one."
4.0,"Good size, works quickly. Tends to heat up almost immediately, however. Also the cord if lost would be difficult to replace, it has a custom design. Definitely fast on transfer of files, for regular backups.  Small and easy to carry."
4.0,"Incredibly flat, works well, inexpensive, easy to route around baseboards, just kinda disappears... It's a winner."
4.0,"A good value.  It was easy to set up, I had it running in less than 15 minutes.  It does a nice job of extending my wifi range in my home."
4.0,Its a little bit smaller than expected. But it is a child's back pack after all.  My grandson thought it was cool.  It appeared to be manufactured well.  Ask me i6 months.
4.0,It works well.
4.0,This i love
