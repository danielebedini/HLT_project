overall,reviewText
3.0,This demn tablet is just a Real Chinese product. The demn camera does not knows it's function. in fact this is third China good. Demn s***
3.0,"performs as expected for a generic controll and for the cheap price. when used in games such as super smash bros, you'll encounter big difference with the originals if playing at a relative competitive manner. but gets the job done for casual play"
3.0,Bought it for someone. It looked okay. Cant comment on its functionality as I am not the one using it.
3.0,"Buggy with Window 8.  PC fails to recognize the unit.  Also, software from Netgear took a long time to install.<br />I'm back to using my old 2Wire/Panda model."
3.0,"I am having some problems with this Kindle.  It's freezing up ever so often and I just have to turn it completely off, wait a while before turning it back on and then it will work for a while longer.  May have to send it back...."
3.0,Its ok!
3.0,Does not hold (grip) Kindle like a previously purchased.
3.0,"I live in a small house with few walls. Signal is strong in 2.4 but weak on 5ghz, behind a single wall (2-3 bars of 5). I am a gamer an i was surprised by the lack of any QOS rules or setting on the firmare and it cant be replaced with ddwrt. i am thinking on purchase another brand."
3.0,perfect!!!
3.0,"Speed, graphics are great. Lightweight and thin. The only problem is that the keyboard is different that what was advertised. It has many extra keys. The product picture was of the computer with a standard keyboard.<br />If the laptop was shipped as advertised it would be 5 star. I am surprised at Amazon for misrepresenting the item."
3.0,It is okay on my Asus Chromebook.  My biggest complaint is that the two devises seem to loose their connection and I wind up banging to mouse to get them to reconnect.  Honestly I can't tell who is the culprit.
3.0,"Although the description says it must be wired to the same circuit as the modem, but on a separate outlet, other notes say you can plug it in anywhere in the home. (With a 100-Amp service and some 30 circuit breakers, try finding the right one!). In short, I never got it to hook up."
3.0,"This hub is half-useful. It seems that if there are 4 USBs hooked up, two of them don't work. So really I am just using it for two extra ports."
3.0,It met my expectations.
3.0,Air is heavy with case on
3.0,"Does what it says, although I find it a bit clumsy and difficult to type (right hand) as i have to stretch my right hand thumb. Would have preferred to get a keyboard with the touch pad in the center instead of to one side."
3.0,"Yes, it's a great aid to protect your surface and reduce wear on pen nibs, and its a great surface cover. However, it gets rid of the &#34;feel&#34; from using the actual tablet itself. I say this because the cover makes the drawing surface a lot slippery with no control. This can affect the way you use this tablet. So keep this in mind, for those of you who likes the feel of the original tablet surface!"
3.0,Overall my daughter likes the back pack.  Shipping to get it here from China was about 4 weeks though.  The only real complaint is that one of the dual zippers was installed backwards.  The zipper opening works so long as you do not move the one zipper.  I would have exchanged it but she needs a back pack to protect her Chrome Book for school and an exchange would have taken weeks to get completed.
3.0,"It's a little bit hard to insert a drive into usb port, but it does the job great."
3.0,works ok good fit
3.0,Not the newest technology.
3.0,Works good
3.0,Benchmarks kind of disappointing. I was expecting a little more considering its specs. But its ok
3.0,Excellent case rendering great protection for your laptop.
3.0,"Not much cushion, loose around my laptop"
3.0,Chemical smell is too dense.
3.0,"When I replaced the previous card in my XP Desktop with this adapter, I started getting Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) randomly (at least daily though).  The driver version that came with the device was 1.11, the one on the website is 1.12 and I've just installed it.  I won't know for a couple of days if the BSOD problems have been solved.<br /><br />This adapter seems to provide good speed and integration with Windows XP.  Also, the reception is good, giving good speed across several walls from one end of the house to another.  If the BSOD problems are solved I'll keep it, otherwise I have to install the previous card that did not support 802.11n."
3.0,"Overall, I feel like the product is fine.  However, I wish I would have purchased the pro version instead, as not having the ability to move it into a portrait view is rather annoying.  The keyboard also has a few odd choices here and there, like the locations of certain keys. It makes it rather annoying to use for typing sometimes."
3.0,This is a good product but the standard thermal compound that came with the Heat sink seems to work well too.
3.0,I bought this cord less than a year ago and it stopped working. TV keeps saying no signal whenever I try to connect my computer to my tv.
3.0,It's ok. You must open the case to plug it in (no cutout for the cord). The pen holder ripped out right away but no big loss there. I would have preferred a backlit keyboard option and multiple viewing angles would have been nice. The overall look is fine and it should provide enough protection for everyday use. I may have rated it higher if I didn't own a Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro for my iPad. It's more expensive but alas they don't make one for the Samsung.
3.0,I had to return this twice because of the charging unit
3.0,Lots of ads<br />Slow processing speed<br />Occasionally shuts down apps<br />WIFI keeps having authentication issues<br /><br />Was cheap for a tablet and now i know why.
3.0,"The cable works like it should, however the USB plastic casing isn't that great."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:3b049473133fd9fd35227f35ffe0c18a]] This is the same lightweight controller that ships with the rather lackluster Razer Forge Android TV device. Thankfully the controller is a little better than the device it was initially designed for.<br /><br />In addition to supporting the Forge console the Serval also works with other Android devices (like phones and tablets) as well as Macs and PCs. The controller connects wirelessly via bluetooth (it requires two included AA batteries) or directly without batteries via the included USB cable. It has a standard micro USB interface. It does NOT work with iOS devices like iPhones and iPads.<br /><br />Some gamers are going to love this controller while others will hate it. Why? Because of the button travel - the depth that the buttons can be pushed down. The four action buttons have a very short travel time (along with mechanical switches) which allow for very rapid fire button mashing, but that might not be ideal for people more accustomed to the deeper travel and squishier feel on Xbox and Playstation devices.<br /><br />And while the travel time on the main buttons is short, the directional pad travel is deeper than other controllers, making retro games like Sonic the Hedgehog more difficult to play. The control sticks feel stiffer than other controllers I've used - this does allow for more fine controls.<br /><br />Bottom line? It's not for everyone. But if you have stick-based games that require a lot of button mashing you might like what Razer has done here with the controller."
3.0,"Doesn't have a screen protector, a bit bulky, but it works for my 2.5yo daughter. She get's limited screen time so she's not carting it around too much and hasn't had a chance to really test the shock proof since we make her sit while using it."
3.0,It does what it's supposed to. The base is heavy enough for normal wires. The unit I received looks a bit different from the picture so it is not quite as attractive as the display model. The only other issue was that it smelled terrible (like a strong industrial plasticy smell) for about a month after I opened it. The smell was strong enough that it filled whatever room the product was in and I had to leave it outside until the smell went away. Washing did not help at all.
3.0,If screen has the dark bars while watching movies or viewing pictures all four corner have yellow clouds.  Very distracting and ugly to look at.  If you will use the screen in its native resolution(full screen) at all times the monitor looks great. Do not recommend because of this.
3.0,Gets hot fast. Gets cranky when you pull the power (on accident since it requires and external power source) and try to plug it back in.
3.0,"the battery fit perfectly and seems to be of good quality.  Why 3 stars? It does the job but it doesn't last as long as I had hoped. At full charge the battery is drained at 80 minutes. That's enough time for me to finish up any work and close down but because the time is about an hour less than I was expecting, I wonder if it will really make 500 cycles? I wasn't running any programs while this &#34;test&#34; was running...:it sat idle. Is it the battery or are the older macs just that less power efficient? Who knows..."
3.0,Great idea but it does not seem to be put together very well. I also did not like to calendar pages.
3.0,"This is an interesting device as a scientific experiment, but not a very good quality speaker. It is interesting as a novelty, but if you care about the quality of sound in your music, I would not recommend it."
3.0,"impressed it works in windows 10 64bit. no need to install drivers windows does it. also the install cd in in Chinese but if you chose to install a program from it then it give choice to install the program in of English. so you don't need to download the new software you cant . also they have beta drivers for win 10. not much difference from the cd drivers. if your at a loss of with one to install from the driver cd . its the one that say dvr with a play arrow next to it that's the dvr software. the last button in red is exit .<br /><br />some of the options don't work in setting and don't in windows 7 either. but for the most part I think this the only one usb that works in 8 or 10n 64bit<br /><br />I have a identical 4 camera version I got from ebay that looks identical to this unit, yet will not work in windows above 7 it has a different chipset  , so this is the one to get if you plan on using a win 7 or newer windows , it not perfect by far but does work in 10 better then 7 or xp . much faster though has same software issues as it does in all the operating system."
3.0,"Damn, I've debated on this bag for awhile. One of the pictures showed the ability to use this briefcase as a backpack. Unfortunately, you cannot without lots of effort, time and annoyance. The strap is long enough to suffice the backpack configuration, but it does not set when placing it on. For example, when placing one arm through the opening to place on your shoulder, the other side of the strap pulls which does not allow you to place your other arm. I used my kitchen counter for help and it did not go well. LOL.<br /><br />Definitely condition the leather for a soft, conformed feel and to break it in. I placed many books inside and conditioned it, because the bag is stiff. [Duh, it's leather.] Be sure to loosen the two overlap straps which secure the bag closed, because the bottom is dependent on them-you'll lose adequate space when they are tight. The overlap straps are looped through rings at the bottom. I configured the overlap straps as shown in the main picture, because it is work unbuckling all three. The middle strap does just fine, but use caution if you carry the bag by its handle.<br /><br />Spending $199 for this bag was not worth the one use I reasoned to buy. I know it is a briefcase. Situations have occurred many times where I wish I could use it like a backpack for ease of traveling through the airport. There are no instructions on the many configurations this bag is capable of doing. I'm smart enough to figure it out on my own, but if there is a way to set the strap steady when using as a backpack . . . please send me it."
3.0,"The actual fit and look of this keyboard are great. Unfortunately, the letters on the silicone don't match the keyboard letters. The following keys on mine are particularly bad (see photo): I, A, S, D, 2, etc. I can live with it, but it's definitely not a perfect product."
3.0,NOW SHIPS WITH ATHEROS CHIPSET. May not work with your Linux setup.
3.0,Heavier than I like and minimum storage area underneath.
3.0,"If you have a Logitech M510 mouse, then don't get this mouse pad because it won't work with it.  I had bought this in black and the M510 wasn't able to track on it.  I ended up returning it.<br /><br />Additionally the hard surface creates a &#34;scratchy&#34; sound.  Take your mouse and move it across a solid surface and that'll give you a close idea of what you'll be dealing with.<br /><br />If you're mouse is compatible with this and you don't mind the sound, then this may be the last mouse pad you'll ever buy because this thing seemed almost immune to normal wear and tear of a fabric mouse pad.  And it was rock stable.  No shifting around at all on my desk."
3.0,"Works great, even better then a more expensive mouse, however the mouse wheels seems to squeak more and more as I use it."
3.0,"HDMI came broken, but it worked fine otherwise.  I would suggest checking all the video input types when you get it.  I returned this unit."
3.0,"With in 30 days, now it turns the screen to black background (on all application) automatically with in 10 from restart. Then i have to go to settings, display, change the option from &#34;standard&#34; to 180 degree view and then revert back to &#34;standard&#34; to get white background."
3.0,"OK basic laptop for the price, but the screen quality (narrow viewing angle) detracts. This is not a good laptop for watching movies."
3.0,i still don't know if my passport will back up program files---i have not been able to find anyone that can tell me that--sure would like o know that info
3.0,"It is ok.  Not what I would say is special. Very quiet, and reasonably fast."
3.0,Not as customer friendly as previous kindle HDX fire.
3.0,"Good product, but one downside: no holes for mounting from bottom as some cases do. Fortunately, SSD drive light enough I was able to rig a mount elsewhere."
3.0,I bought 2 tablets one for my 10 yr old and one for my 6 year old mainly so they would stop bugging me for my phone to play games. One of the main reasons I bought these tablets was because my oldest likes to play Clash of Clans and my younger one likes Minecraft but to my surprise the Clash of Clan game was not available for download and Minecraft was but for $6.99. I called to speak with a representative about it and he said that the developer's for Clash of Clan have not made the game available for this tablet. I wish I would have known that before I bought them. Otherwise the tablets have been working okay but I've only had them for a week.
3.0,I find that I cannot download some of the books that are on my Nexus tablet. Very disappointed about that.
3.0,It broke after three months.
3.0,Beware of size when buying these connectors.  I thought I was getting a standard sized HDMI male to female cable and the male side is HDMI mini.<br />Mistakes like this suck when you have to double pay to ship back and receive the right item.
3.0,"It's a good product, and inexpensive enough to buy more than one. The plastic screen cover is too rigid and makes it difficult to use portions of the screen. The stand never wanted to stay on, and after putting it back on ten times, it just gave up altogether.<br /><br />Otherwise, my kids have dropped the iPad and it has survived those spills. It does what it's supposed to do."
3.0,"Purchased the product 2 weeks ago and it's nice.  Holds my 13&#34; MBP Retina well but I did have to remove the speck shell in order for it to fit.  I would have given it 5 stars but 2 of the silicon feet fell off, one right after the other.  Other than that it the color matches my Mac and is very stable."
3.0,I have had this computer 4 years with windows 7 and have loved it. Now I can install sp1 but when I do the updates no longer work. Have tried every thing. I now think it is this computer. I never had a problem with service packs with xp. I just can't get this to work and wont be able to update to windows 10. It does work well. If anyone wants to buy mine let me know. I think I will get a computer with windows 10 now. This is so frustrating since it really works well with just windows 7.
3.0,"It works as a replacement for the original power cord (I use an HP Pavilion g7-1237dx and this was recommended since the original power cord had some sort of defect). I have no complaints. The adapter can get hot very easily though, even if it's just resting on a carpet without anything else near it, so if you get it, be sure to have the adapter as isolated as possible, so it has good airflow around it."
3.0,"It does the job; however, I'm so used to a regular sized keyboard, I struggle with using this one especially because the placement of some of the punctuation is in a different place and hard to hit some keys without practicing."
3.0,"These speakers sound OK,  They are definitely lacking a mid range on sound.  The LED's look cool, but don't really pulse unless you turn the volume really high.  Also, both speakers are on one wire so you can't put the wires through grommets on your desk without minor modification.  The overall feel is a little cheap as well."
3.0,Great video card for what I needed (multiple DisplayPort connectors) but PNY has their head up their you know what.  This card ONLY ships with a 1/2 height back panel bracket and PNY refuses to provide any options for full height even though bracket is identical to the NVS510 (that ships with both)!  I ended up cutting up the 1/2 bracket included with the card and a plan full ht bracket and bolting them together (franken bracket).  It works great but looks like crap.  I deducted two stars because of this idiocy.
3.0,Part that plugs into phone stopped working after about a month on both that I bought
3.0,ok
3.0,"Best quality for the cost. Hands-down the most comfortable long-use headset I've had for gaming.<br />I use a 7.1 surround sound system for music with all the VoIP chatting on the headset.<br />This works fantastically!!!<br /><br />Edit after this 2nd pair decided to take a dump on me again. (5/26/16)<br />This is the 2nd pair that has not only shorted itself, but also shorted the USB in my 2nd unrelated motherboard that required me to reseat cables and power cycle the board praying that it didn't burn out the USB connector like my first mobo. I really really love the comfortable headphones, but it's severely disappointing to me that this is doing more damage than good at this point.<br /><br />Leaving this as 3-star since I may be an anomaly, but infuriating that I've gone through 2 now with the same issue on 2 different mobos."
3.0,Very flimsy very fragile if you do get this cooling pad be very careful handling it because it will break ! I recommend finding one spot to put it and leave it there because it will surely break if handled to much
3.0,"This cord worked for awhile, but then the cord loosened from the connection and did not charge my tablet anymore."
3.0,"I actually miss the keyboard unit I had (3rd Gen, I believe.) Navigating the touch-screen on this thing to highlight, make notes, etc., is quite frustrating. I'm constantly accidentally getting too much or too little. When I remove my finger from the screen it often jumps ahead or back. I use an iPhone daily and don't have issues, so I think these controls just needs some tweaking."
3.0,Not the movement I was expecting but it is a good quality analog. It is very useful in trying in many projects using an arduino for example.
3.0,After reading a ton of reviews for the Kids Kindle I decided to go for this one as it seems that many parents would have prefered to go this route. I am used to more user friendly tablets but this was on sale and decided to give it a go. My son is utterly disinterested and so am I. Using this definitely takes some getting used to.
3.0,"You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive.<br /><br />They come in a wide variety of styles - plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, the *only* manufacturer of 1TB USB flash drives is Kingston with their DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 1TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />Good generic flash drives *are* out there, but the true capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

3.0,Decent drive. However it's kind of slow on boot up.
3.0,More picky to turn on but sick of buying the more expensive ones and having to replace them every two yrs.
3.0,Works pretty good. Reader is very good. I would give it 5 stars if it had google play store. C'mon Amazon.
3.0,"Although it is low price, it is no sensitivity of touch screen.  I am a very skilled in electronics circuits and have reassembled a couple time with care, but touch screen has no response.  It was working with broken screen before replace it.  The circuit attached screen may be equivalent but appearances are different, such as circuit layout and dot mark red vs. white.  I have no microcircuit inspection station so I could not find the reason.  The part will be removed and test with original broken screen.  Darkblue"
3.0,"This item arrived in frustration free packaging and came to me in very good condition. Overall, the outer part is of good quality.The material is flexible and thin enough. However, I must bee honest and clarify that it is not that fast for charging. I tried charging my phone while using it because I had some important things to get done and it stayed at 2% for AT LEAST 15 minutes. However, once I left it alone, it did finish charging in about 45 minutes. Is it worth full price? probably not. Just because I need something that is adaptable and fast since I am always busy with my kids."
3.0,"It did work for my laptop, however the battery locking tab on the left side does not lock properly and the battery will fall out of the laptop."
3.0,Pro's:  This screen looks nice and has all the correct labels and such.  I used it on a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro model.  It fits and came in pristine condition.<br /><br />Con's:  The glue it came with DOES NOT hold!  I would recommend ordering an alternative glue at the same time.
3.0,"It works but there are 2 drawbacks.<br /><br />1)  It isn't sturdy enough to be used on a keyring.  It would be OK as a stored backup key, however.<br /><br />2)  It stores accounts on the key.  It will hold 64.  There is no way to erase an account.  Contrast this with the YubiKey which stores the account on the servers, thus allowing an infinite number of accounts."
3.0,"It was going to take days to move over 1TB of data using Ethernet for an Ethernet device. Not exaggerating here either, it was set to 73 hours, and that's just crazy. I couldn't get this to work as a local USB connection directly to my computer to move files over either, as the built in USB port must be used to connect up other devices, not to communicate to other computers. So I saved time by connecting another USB device to the computer, backing up to it, and then backing that up to the Seagate device using it's built in USB. That's a lot of hoops to get files onto a data sharing device, but I saw no way around it versus waiting days. And that method only took about 7 hours (I walked away, so guessing here, it could have been less).<br />The built in backup software isn't the most versatile either, at least not at my first go-through of it. This works, but it's not what I would call polished. I would like to select just my music and pictures to always be backed up continuously so they are available to my other devices - you know, like a synchronized cloud backup....yeah, not so simple. I'll update if I can figure out how to easily do that."
3.0,"after using a chiclet sytle keyboard I couldn't use this traditional keyboard. The button throw length seems like a lot now.<br />But, if you like that style I would say buy it. It works great. This is just not my preference."
3.0,"I wish with all my heart that an instruction manual had been sent along with my order.  I am not as good about figuring things out on my own.  I've been trying to get my kids to help me, but we are having trouble getting together, so my tablet just sits there waiting for me to get with it.  I love the opening page on it.  It really touches my heart.  I just really wish I could use it,."
3.0,"Already rattling after a short period (of constant use).  Doing the job, just not as quietly as it did at first."
3.0,Not a great quality but if you throw peanuts....<br />It is already getting ripped.
3.0,This mouse falls somewhere on the line between horizontal and vertical. Depending on the severity of your carpal tunnel this mouse may not be vertical-enough to provide pain relief. I found it didn't help my hand pain at all because it was too horizontal to be effective. However my husband tried it out and loves it. He found it extremely comfortable to use.
3.0,Does what it says but could probably more effectively move air.  Good enough for what it was needed though
3.0,"I bought this and the Logitech hd pro C920 and the C920 was well worth the difference in price.  The MS LifeCam's audio is fine if you are in a recoding studio but if there is background noise, it's going to pick it all up and make it hard for the people on the other end to hear/understand the intentional audio."
3.0,"The camera part of this product works great,  The microphone is inadequate.  At a distance of less than 18 inches it can barely pick up my voice and I speak loudly as it is."
3.0,"A nice tablet/transformer netbook. The design is practically the same as my old EeePC. I attempted to do some regular stuff on this and it was really sluggish. I bought this to stream games to and look up guides while playing console stuff. I had a really hard time unlocking it, and frequently had to hard reboot it to get it to unlock after long sleep periods.<br /><br />Biggest gripe - the SD expansion card sticks out of the side. What is the point of the expansion slot if the card is going to be able to get bumped and pushed about, possibly broken, on a tablet like this? Bad design choice.<br /><br />I returned this as it did not meet my needs, mostly caused me to be frustrated. Would not recommend a win8 tablet, my next try will probably be on an android tablet instead."
3.0,"Great basic mouse, although expect a delay when trying to connect to your computer.​"
3.0,"The instruction that came with the item was NOT accurate at all, we had to call technical support and ended up being on hold for more than 30 minutes.  The person was helpful but she did not seem to understand the connection issue right away, she provided an instruction that was not included in the instruction that came with the package.  If only they can update the instruction, which will definitely be much less confusing."
3.0,"In the end, didn't use it."
3.0,"The case itself is nice, has a good fit and feel and would definitely offer added protection. The screen protector on the other hand is poorly designed and tested! When the screen protector is attached an air bubble is formed and will get trapped between it and the Kindle screen.  Once trapped it move where your fingers scroll and eventually alters the look and feel of the entire screen. I ended up cutting the screen protector screen out and using just the outer rim. Because the case itself is so nice I still gave it 3 stars, this should be a 5 star product with a little R&D"
3.0,The color was a bit greener than I expected.
3.0,"This is a neat little tablet. It does just about everything I was hoping it would but I do have some issues with the digitizer not working at times and having to reset the unit to get it to come back. After checking online it looks like this is a common issue. Since I bought it to mainly use the stylus for not taking and project documentation in my shop this was a bit of a disappointment. Also, there are no regular sized USB ports on this device like there are on my 7&#34; winBook. You can use an OTG cable to hook up USB devs but there is only one port for charging/usb/etc. Other than that it's fast, the screen looks good, when the digitizer works it works well and it's a welcomed addition to my workbench where a large full size laptop or tablet would be a nuisance."
3.0,Because of it's small foot print the layout didn't work for me.  I had a hard time with placement of the keys.  I ended up returning it and getting the normal size keyboard instead.
3.0,Of course this is not the original keyboard that came with T410/420 series. As I own both T410 and T420 I can tell this one is not original by looking at the keyboard. But it fits into the laptop pretty well and the typing feeling is not that bad. Also note that the keycaps came with this keyboard are not 100% same as the original keyboard so you can't simply swap the keycaps in this keyboard to the original keyboard to fix the &#34;slippery keycap&#34; problem. Seller was IDParts Inc.
3.0,Works for what I paid for it
3.0,Much smaller than expected.
3.0,Works well.  Suited it's purpose.
3.0,"received your product on time.<br />I received this product on time. I bought it based on user's review.<br />I plugged it to my desktop (just upgraded to Windows 10). This desktop use an on-board wireless card. The signal is weak (1 bar). That's why I would like to buy an external USB wireless adapter. After installing the driver and utility, scanning the signals, it can find my neighbor signals, but not mine. After rebooting a few times, and scan a few times, it get my signal (by luck). The signal is strong (96%). However, if I reboot the machine, the the connection disappear. It took me an effort to rescan signal to get the signal again.<br />When I get the connection, I have problem with the web page retrieval (E.g. yahoo.com). It takes 5 times longer to retrieve yahoo.com page comparing with my internal onboard wireless. This is very frustrating.<br />I don't know if this problem is related to Windows 10 or something else."
3.0,"According specifications should work on my laptop, but sometimes turns off, it must be that this battery is not for my laptop"
3.0,Lot of storage but not user friendly.
3.0,Works good. Only complaint is how hot it gets when using it.
3.0,"The hard drive is separated into 2 separate drives, not 1 750-gb drive list most other computer. the keyboard is very nice, although it turns off very quickly if the computer receives no input. i'd give it a solid 20 seconds of light after you stop touching the computer before it turns off the keyboard lights. it is easy to press the home button during normal typing and going back to the beginning of a sentence, however the end button is placed on the &#34;1&#34; key on the numpad, and pressing Fn doesn't let you select end. you have to turn off num lock to use end, which ticks me off, especially since the Fn key works for the calculator, &#34;Enter&#34; and delete (period) keys. also, there are 2 insert and delete keys...why?? the normal delete(insert) key on the top of the keyboard, as well as the &#34;0&#34; and &#34;period&#34; keys functioning as insert and delete respectively. i have, in the month or so since i've received the laptop, had 3 driver failures, and 2 instances of the laptop not charging, and needing to be unplugged for about 5 minutes or so being being plugged back in the charge correctly, and 1 instance of not connecting to the internet, even though the icon showed the wireless bars as having 4 of the 5 filled showing a good signal, and when i went to the wireless center, it simply said &#34;no networks available&#34; without even giving the normal options of turning wifi on/off or airplane mode on/off. i had to restart the computer to fix the issue, which was a pain, as i was in the middle of class and needed the info yesterday. in addition, even though, since the moment i noticed the hard drives are separated into 2, with the OS being saved onto the C drive, i have installed all new programs solely on the D drive, the computer has exponentially slowed down, as if i had installed everything onto the OS drive. however, even with the slowdown in normal tasks, it still retains the approx 2 second startup and wakeup times.there is a slight bit of lagging on some of the higher end games with graphics on high (not max, or ultimate, just high) and despite what you may think when you see the wireless card advertised as having wireless n capability, it does not, in fact, connect to 5.0 Ghz networks, even though wireless b/g/n SHOULD be able to see and connect to them. overall, if you can afford it, go for $200 or $300 more expensive model, to actually get what you want, or pay less money for a cheaper model, because either way you won't get what you want :/<br /><br />unfortunately it's too late for me to return the laptop, and even if it wasn't, i need it for schoolwork, so i couldn't return it anyway, because i wouldn't get a new one on time for classes.<br /><br />oh yeah, one more thing, when using the touchpad for the mouse, it's kind of...different...than any other laptop touchpad i've ever used, so you'll have to get used to it.clicks are kinda weird, and when you right-click (or double finger tap) there is a slight lag before you can move the mouse again to select the option you wanted."
3.0,It can be scratched easily.
3.0,"It's comparatively slow since the cpu is designed not for a desktop but would rather a cheap tablet. It produces quite a noise for my study room since the fan is running like a hell trying to lowing down the temperature inside pc units. I brought it just for basic web surfing so I didn't return it, also i use it only occasionally. So if you want a more serious desktop still, should stay away."
3.0,"Did not used, once returned Vimtag camera."
3.0,Delivered as promised but have not had it long enough to see how well it works and for how long.
3.0,"Everything works perfectly except the bottom front portion does not stay clipped to the bottom of the plastic frame.  The soft rubber part is designed to hook to a plastic frame, but the rubber part doesn't hook.  It just sort of hangs there.  Only on the bottom, all of the other 3 sides clip in the frame and work and look quite good.  I works well enough that it gives the iPad protection against drop, etc.  Not a problem big enough to warrant a return."
3.0,One out of 3 chargers received stopped working after the 3rd day. It kept saying the device does not support the connection and would not charge and got hot. But the other 2 work fine so far! They are long and look like good quality.
3.0,"My wrist still hurts , but not as bad as the naked table."
3.0,It was just ok.
3.0,I am very pleased with the added keyboard.  The case cover is not as strong at holding the unit as I thought it would be.  It does cover and protect is as I thought it should.
3.0,"Once the swivel mount heats up in the car, it sags due to the weight of the GPS on it.  Had the same problem with the supplied ball arm as well as the Rugged Ridge ball arm mount for my Jeep.  Suction cup works better than the stock TomTom mount which fell off of the glass after a week and wouldn't reattach for more than 30 seconds"
3.0,"This is a study in &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;<br /><br />I bought this tablet for my office, as an experiment more or less: I wanted to see if it could replace some of our paperwork with Google Forms, and to see if patients would tolerate (or better yet learn something from) a few minutes of educational video each visit. While I had my clinic wired to accept multiple TVs, I never got around to it, and technology has caught up so that portable DVD players are no longer needed.<br /><br />WHERE CORNERS WERE CUT<br />Aesthetics - It's kinda heavy, which doesn't bother me, but the buttons are all on one end and not intuitive<br />Form - I can only see that one particular cover fits it completely, and it has mixed reviews.<br />Camera - It's horrible. That's all I can say about it. Just horrible.<br />OS - Their version of Android leaves out what are normally standard features. For example, I was shocked to find that there is no way to set up user accounts. I had planned on setting the tablet up as the administrator/owner, and creating a &#34;Guest&#34; or &#34;Patient&#34; account with limited access. That way I could leave it with someone for 15 minutes, and trust that person would not (accidentally or otherwise) end up on inappropriate websites, in the middle of my email, or on our clinic server. My choices are to root it, or to get a child protection app. It also (as far as I can tell so far) as no automatic setting for screen brightness. Given these two big omissions in their build of the OS, I'm assuming that there are going to be other things missing that I will find over the next couple of weeks. There were default settings which were out of the norm, like having the microphone (for speech dictation) not set to appear in the keyboard by default. I had to search around the internet to find out how to get it put back where it has been on every other Android device I've ever used.<br /><br />WHERE IT PERFORMS ACCEPTABLY<br />Screen - For my uses and for theprice, it was acceptable.<br />Speed - It handles large picture files, movies (on the device and streaming) and all the apps I use perfectly well and smoothly.<br />Overall build - Seems good so far. The touch screen works and is just sensitive enough. I don't think it has the &#34;hover&#34; capability like my phone does though.<br /><br />After installation of &#34;Kids Place&#34; and an app to allow full screen pictures, I think that it will do what I needed it to do. If not, it will be my toy for Facebook, light email, light reading, and quick searches while hanging out around the house. I wanted something this size, and there's nothing that's even close to it in price."
3.0,Can fit about anything in the case and great wire management the only down side is that all the stock wires are cheaply made.
3.0,Covers part of the screen making it difficult to get to some menu items.  Nice material but design needs a little refinement.
3.0,"The fan itself works fine, but I'll be honest with you the bottom part that holds it on broke after a week. I had to glue the stainless steel plate to the bottom of the unit itself."
3.0,"Very pretty but smells really bad.  My daughter took this to college two weeks ago and it still smells, although the smell is getting a little weaker."
3.0,"Returned,  too tight."
3.0,Working so far.  Followed other instructions of other reviewers.  INSTALL PROGRAMMING BEFORE YOU INSERT ADAPTER!!  Best advice ever!  Thank you fellow reviewers!  I now have wifi back again!         UPDATE:  I have had this adapter for about two months and have changed my rating from a 5 star to a 3.  Panda 300Mbps worked beautifully in the beginning and now it is failing.  Unit gets too hot and does not have longevity.  I was lucky I got it to work right now.  Updating review and ordering another adapter.
3.0,Be sure to order NOT with special offers.
3.0,Does just exactly what it was intended to do.  No lag. No service interrupted. Had Suddenlink but got tired of paying $15 a month for their router so I got my own router/modem combo.<br /><br />4 Feb 2016 - UPDATE - I recently downloaded the most current iOS 9 for my iPhone 6.  Now I can barely keep a connection to my wifi.  I'm going to do more research to see if it's the phone or the router/modem combo.  Maybe end up buying a separate model and router instead of having the combo.  More to come.<br /><br />7 Feb 2016 - Yep. I'm still struggling with WiFi issues on my phone. I cannot keep a connection to this WiFi combo. I'm constantly changing WiFi channels and resetting the system. My phone works on other networks...but for some reason this router/modem combo is going in and out.  Maybe it's a flaw in the system.  Hopefully Netgear can help me out.
3.0,Good
3.0,It was okay just didnt work that well
3.0,Top part is all I kept. It's solid but the bottom and keyboard protector are pieces of s***
3.0,"Keyboard is incredibly large and slightly cumbersome. However, I knew that before I bought this product. It wasn't a problem for me and probably won't be for those buying it, but I feel it needs to be said.<br /><br />The lighting on the keyboard was also great and added to its appeal.<br /><br />My major problem with it was that the space bar developed the most irritating squeak I think I've ever heard. Every space between every word became a nightmare and jumping in games was almost unbearable.<br /><br />Ended up selling it to a friend and switching back to my older keyboard."
3.0,"the cable is deteriorating and the inner wires are showing. Soon, it is going to split and stop working. Too bad it didn't last for long."
3.0,"this bag is amazing, the only issues are, when i ordered it the bag was missing the main shoulder strap and my 15.6 in toshiba laptop fits into it snugly, with little room for the power cords, love the purple color and it is very light wieght"
3.0,Super cute!!!!! But only lasted 4 months before the sides starting tearing. Good for light users:) Fast shipping and delivery time:)
3.0,Easy to use and it works
3.0,The drive seems to work ok but not the software. Couldn't back up my iPhone.
3.0,very good and sturdy comes with different attachments to fit you Cd slot just beware of police can be an &#34;obstruction of view ticket&#34;
3.0,Not bad but was hoping to get a little more distance between the keyboard and player. Anything more than 5 feet and it would get pretty jumpy on the mouse movements
3.0,"Was looking for a good on-the-go USB stick that had a fair and competitive pricing. This was on flash sale and had good reviews, so I decided to give it shot. Cant have to many USB sticks around the house, right? This stick worked for me for awhile, but for some reason it started doing some wonky things. While it works most of the time and does what I need it to do, I sometimes have troubles when copying a lot of files or bigger files lately. It will freeze around the 100mb left, and it did this on multiple computers. I have formatted it multiple times and done other IT tricks, but unfortantely it still hangs up here and there.<br /><br />I would go another route if I were to get another USB stick in the near future from my personal experience. However, I would recommend this if its on sale, as I'm sure my experience is just an uncommon fluke."
3.0,"the box on the cord gets way too hot. and of course, it's two feet shorter than my original cord so i can't sit where i'm used to sitting when using my laptop."
3.0,I love taking pictures on my Canon EOS M and posting pictures on social media such as Instagram and Facebook.  This SD card makes taking photos and uploading directly to my phone a much easier process than having to upload to my computer first.  The only down side is that the wifi connection can be a bit spotty and there have been quite a few times where my phone would reject the wifi from the card and would not connect. I typically have to go through a cycle of turning off my wifi on my phone and restarting my camera and eventually it works.  Still I like the card and its still more convenient than having to go through my computer first.
3.0,It is a lot more useful to use this when trying to do fine point related activities.  However I felt like I was scratching the heck out of my screen using this.
3.0,Works fine mines arrived with the usb power cable broken It was very cheap quality But after repalcing the cable with another one it worked fine
3.0,"It looks great new, but is starting to peel apart around the edges.  I've only had it a few months and I don't use my iPad that often either."
3.0,we needed repair upon arrival . the fan was making REALLY LOUD SOUND.
3.0,It worked with no problems for a year and yesterday it stopped working.  It was able to connect to the cable company but unable to connect to the modem over ethernet.  I got another cable modem to make sure that it was the modem and the other modem worked fine.
3.0,"It does work, but not as I expected.  I was hoping for a appreciable difference in signal strength.  For my situation I suppose I need more power in the amplifier to pass through my walls in the house to service the areas that do not receive satisfactory signals.<br />L. Thompson"
3.0,"It's a little slow but decent for the money that I paid for it, still relatively new so hopefully it continues to run decently for the rest of the time I'm in college"
3.0,I have had the mouse for just under two months. It worked well until the other day when the right click became overly sensitive to the point that blowing on it will cause it to click. Until this point it worked wonderfully.
3.0,Really difficult to avoid dust particles.
3.0,"It wasnt a perfect fit, I had to retro fit it a little. A pain but works."
3.0,"The straps are sewn on the inside of the bag so you can't zip it up all the way when the computer is inside - strange design.  Other than that, the bag is decent given the cost."
3.0,"My husband and I ordered this, but we have has trouble with the product. It doesn't always work. I was going to return if, but we lost the box so we kept it. It hasn't worked right for a long time."
3.0,"Pluses:<br />Extremely slim and lightweight, so it doesn't take up a lot of space.<br />Stand attaches quickly with no need for tools.<br />Plug-and-play: just plug it in and go. Didn't require any special drivers or cumbersome setup.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Poor speakers. Really bad sound quality. Don't rely on the built in speakers for your primary sound needs. Sound was so bad I don't even know why they bothered.<br />Takes a lot of adjustments to get image picture quality right: Had to keep fiddling with the settings to get the correct brightness and color output. Once it was set, the image is acceptable but nothing great.<br /><br />Overall, this would be a good choice for a secondary monitor, but as a primary monitor it is a bit lacking. If you are a casual computer user, the monitor is perfectly functional. But if you watch movies or play games from your computer, you will want a higher end monitor."
3.0,The microphone piece fell apart after three days of having it.
3.0,"The cables themselves were essentially worthless for my particular application. My Samsung Galaxy S5 and a Lenovo tablet barely charged at all, even when plugged in separately to either of two different Anker chargers with these cables. The charging was so weak the phone actually used more power than was added when the screen was in use while charging. Also, the connector on one of them became loose from its housing and did not maintain a steady connection without being placed in a certain position. However, the same chargers work fine with the equivalent Cable Matters cables in white, as well as with iPhones and iPads on Cable Matters lightning cables in both black and white. That leads me to believe it is just these cables that have the issues.<br /><br />Those things being said, the company sent replacement cables with no hassle. When those did not work any better, they ultimately issued a refund. I would give the cables themselves a 1 star rating and the customer service a 4 or 5, so a 3 seems generous given I still need to find cables that actually work."
3.0,"Brand new it was really good when it first came out. I still have mine and the only thing I had to replace was the internal battery. If you have a kid, say around 10 years old, it's great for a starter computer. It'll help with homework, teach how to use a computer and learn how to troubleshoot a computer. Thus you're teaching how to fish rather than giving a fish."
3.0,"I like the drive but one time the shell came off the board with the chips when removing it from a laptop.  After I re-inserted the shell back on, it seems to function still but not sure why it came off in the first place?  Maybe I received a dud?"
3.0,It was good but failed after 18 month.<br /><br />I expected at least 3 years from such a trusted brand.
3.0,"I wouldn't recommend. Don't get me wrong, its a great laptop but in college nowadays they're using a lot of software to have access to your tests and quizzes and homework; all of these not supported by Chromebook. You COULD install windows on it but I it defeats the purpose of getting a chromebook in my opinion. Other than that, it's great. It's fast, reliable to the point where its almost impossible to lose documents if your computer crashes. It feels great as far as the keyboard goes, and the weight."
3.0,Tcolors are fairly washed out and it's very difficult to get the right angle for viewing the screen correctly- it's very one-dimensional in that you can only see it clearly from a very specific angle.
3.0,"This is my daughters, and she says it is 'adequate'  ;)"
3.0,Not that bad
3.0,Not so easy to connect to tablet
3.0,"Great but I had to return it - first Olympus.com gave me wrong information and my 13 yr old camera could not handle 512MB and secondly, I received a new camera for my birthday and it would not accept the Olympus memory card so I returned it."
3.0,"I got this drive for christmas in 2014, and now on September 30th, it failed. I used it to store huge files from my gopros and when I record gaming videos. It has been through alot being used about 8 hours a day. I did drop it once so that probably contributed to it failing."
3.0,"The plastic seems sturdy so far and it fits my macbook air perfectly (model A1369). I do have a few problems with it though, it came cracked on the top right corner of the bottom piece because it was padded on only one side during shipping. It also has a couple bumps on the top piece, and the color (yellow) is also much more muted than in the picture but that could be the fault of my monitor. I don't have the problem of the top piece forcing the bottom piece to pop off when the computer is opened completely. All in all, I'm happy I got it, but shipping could have been better. Besides the crack, I think this case will last a pretty long time."
3.0,"it's a pretty good tablet/laptop. I like it, but the webcam is way lower quality than specified. The video shows up with little tiny purple dots all over. Like if you're skyping, you have purple dots all over u. It's a good little laptop, but i kinda wish i got a different one."
3.0,"easiest setup ever of any router i have ever owned - the utilities on iphone, ipad, mac are very simple to use - the tool is missing an advanced log feature which is sorely needed for anyone who works with routers.<br /><br />unfortunately, after 8 months my unit started erratically dropping the signal and the router would be shown to alternate green and orange led light rapidly (10 times a second) - this is not a documented error LED and the unit eventually failed.<br /><br />i tend to burn up routers in short term for some reason - maybe its the heat living in southern california.<br /><br />will be getting a replacement in a few days and expect to update the review."
3.0,"The cover fits like a glove, and feels good and safe to carry with the slightly rubberized coating. A couple of the little feet did not last long, however, as the stress of sliding the macbook on occasion slipped them off"
3.0,"Ok.. I purchased 4 of these in late. They work well, I had them on 24/7 under pretty heavy loads, no issues just plug them in and go. Now it is Aug 2015 by this time 3 of the 4 have failed. Out of warranty of course.  All with the same simptoms. I should have trashed the first 2 but for some reason I just labeled them as bad and put them on the parts shelf.<br /><br />In a past life I was an electronic tech and when this last one went, I decided to take a look at them since each one seemed to fail in the exact same way.  The first 2 within weeks of each other. They just simply stopped working all the standard port lights were out. But the 2 SFP and the power light were on solid. A recycle of the power (unplug - plug) did not change anything. This made me think it had to be a common component that was failing and I might be able to eyeball it.<br /><br />Clearly they were not production quality and never could be trusted again but maybe they would be good in a pinch if I needed a switch but did not have a good replacement on hand.<br /><br />Once I opened them up, what I found on for all 3 of the failed switches was that there were bloated capacitors on the power supply(PS). So I took a look at the output of the PS on one of them and it was 4.3vdc but the PS was labeled as 5v. I scrounged up some replacement caps. and replaced them. It was pretty easy to do, just desolder the old caps and put in the new ones of the same or better ratings. I put them in and tested. All fixed up.<br /><br />Next I ordered a few more caps from Amazon. [[ASIN:B00CD1ECYO Bluecell pack of 20, 16V 1000uF 105c High Temperature Radial Leads Replacement Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitor]] and fixed the other 2.<br /><br />You can see in the close up of the PS where the 3 closest Caps are all bulging at the top. and the ones in the back are flat. That is a sure sign of a cap that has seen better days. The other pics are just a good look at the inners of the switch. Note there are no fans. I also include 2 pics of one of the bad caps I removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone that might be thinking of purchasing theses. Or someone that has had a similar issue.include 2 pics of one of the bad caps I removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone that might be thinking of purchasing theses. Or someone that has had a similar issue."
3.0,I was searching for a wireless modem / router and this came up high on the results. Unfortunately it is not wireless and it's not a router. I was able to make it work for me by buying a wireless router to go with it. So far it's working fine.
3.0,"Modem works fine but activation was a nightmare. Appears to be faster and more stable across multiple devices than my old SB5100. The first speedtest I did got me a full 55Mbps (max for my level of service).<br />Time Warner online activation communicated with the modem but then failed. This sent me to activation support where a polite lady in India wasted an hour of my time. Finally I got through to &#34;level 3 tech support&#34; and my modem was activated in less than 5 minutes. The issue was because the modem had been registered to a previous owner (refurbished -- duh!) and the activation needed a lvl 3 tech authorization to move it from one account to the next (kicker is that it was likely TWC who sold these refurbs in the first place!).<br />Please learn from my mistake, try the online activation if you like but if it fails after already recognizing your new modem (step 2), give up and call TWC &#34;level 3 tech support.&#34; Make sure you have the MAC # which is on the bottom of the modem.<br />Or if you have any alternative to TWC then do yourself a solid and switch providers."
3.0,received a damaged on call hp and they send me on wich the camera dosent work
3.0,Sony 4 GB Memory Stick ProDuo MSMT4G/TQ1...
3.0,Love my gadgets thank you
3.0,Worked for a while then started to get really hot.  Had it replaced. Seems to work now.
3.0,"Case itself fits well, easy to install, but I was very disappointed to find a logo visibly placed on the front panel (as opposed to discretely on the bottom), when there was none on the picture."
3.0,"Does what it is supposed to, but one of the wires keeps falling out so one of my fans will only light up but it won't run."
3.0,"if you need a basic keyboard, this is the one! NO 2nd function.  you got what you paid for, but if you stretch a little more of your budget....you will get a better 2nd function keyboard."
3.0,ok
3.0,"I like these headphones, but after wearing them for a bit they start to hurt the top of my head. I just purchased the new rgb corsair wireless void headset and that one makes this one feel like a cheap dollar store knockoff."
3.0,"I've been a lifelong fan of HP, but this is probably the worst computer I've ever gotten from them.  At least once a week, it encounters a problem and shuts down while I have important things open that I'm working on (this has been happening since I got it from the box).  This is probably the biggest issue.  Besides that, several drivers have had to be reinstalled since I bought it, just a few months ago.  The touchscreen is really too heavy for the keyboard, and as a result it tends to fall backward on any soft surface (like my lap), and is very tippy on hard surfaces too.  The touchscreen is okay...but it tends to be a bit &#34;sticky&#34;.  It's not glass like most smartphones are, so my finger tends to drag and leave smudges much more easily, and after a while of using it, the touchscreen gets jumpy and buggy because of this.  It also makes it hard to be precise with the touchscreen.  The power button is quite difficult to use as well - sometimes if it's on sleep, I press it and the computer comes back immediately.  Other times, I press it and nothing happens after a few moments, so I end up pressing it a few times trying to make it come back to life and the computer inevitably ends up restarting itself (again a pain).  Also, and this is such a tiny issue, but has bugged me - about two weeks after I got it, one of the rubber feet fell off the bottom, so now it's a bit lopsided, even though it's still quite new.  All in all, this is just not HP's best offering at all."
3.0,"part of it is like bent after less than one month, so there"
3.0,works well but you have to fully extend all the way out for it to rewind back in.  That is a pain.
3.0,"I bought this for A1466 MacBook Air. Battery works good, but a screwdriver for pentalobe (1.5 mm; size 6) was too big, so I had to get right one (1.2 mm; size 5)."
3.0,It wasn't compatible with my iPhone 6.
3.0,There was an area where the leather had peeled.  This may be due to the fact that this was the last piece.  Workmanship is inconsistant so one may be more lucky and end up with a nicer bag.  That being g siad the price is good and it will be functionwble as a laptop bag.
3.0,Everything okey except the ram only 512mb (Showed by cccleaner). Spec say the tab has 1gb ram. What's wrong Amazon?.
3.0,"The battery fits right, and it works. The charge only lasts me like 2 hours, which is not terrible in my opinion. It takes a while to charge back up but I am not using the original charger for my macbook pro so that might be it. For the price I think its good."
3.0,Works Ok but a little disappointed that it isn't faster. The components are higher than my old pc but its not as fast as my laptop despite having more RAM and a more powerful processer. The screen display is good and was installed with windows 8 and recently upgraded to windows 10 which is much better.
3.0,Does not work with my iMac on Yosemite 10.10.1

3.0,Looks fine.
3.0,"Works ok, better than the old battery I replaced. Does not lost very long at around 3 hours though, and I carefully followed the directions. Of running it down to 7% then charging and the back to 7% three times. Get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,I'll say it's more orange than gold.
3.0,I purchased two of the SD cards recently and use both on a Canon 5DMIII shooting RAW only; I also have other Lexar SD and Compact Flash cards that are rated 'slower'.  I just returned from a 4 week vacation where I used these cards while shooting wildlife and found that I was only able to get 4 to 5 shots per 'burst' before the camera and/or SD card buffer prevented me from continuing and it usually took 3 to 5 seconds before I could continue. This really frustrated me considering the 'rating' from the manufacturer and my 4 weeks with these cards didn't convince me that they are as fast as promised.
3.0,Haven't been able to use it as I need to. Nothing is showing up on the projector. I can't quite figure out whether the problem is this device or my computer or the projector.
3.0,Flimsy
3.0,"The case fit my new computer very well, however the colors are not what I expected.  I thought the case would be gray and white and it seemed to be more gray and dingy gray in color."
3.0,"It's easy to set up and use since it's basically a plug and play wireless mouse. Looks cool, especially with the lights on. Not sure if the DPI Button works with my computer since I've upgraded to Windows 10 and the drivers may be off: I haven't noticed a difference when I press the button.  The auto-sleep mode to save battery is a little too short for my liking; I spend a short amount of time writing and then the standby mode turns on, meaning when I grab the mouse again I need to click to wake it up. A little annoying while writing essays.   EDIT: The wheel squeaks a little too which is kind of disappointing considering how quiet the mouse usually is."
3.0,The Cruzer has very large secured capacity.  The negative is the speed - takes hours to securely delete trash ... way too long for an SSD.
3.0,"Easy to put the Kindle in, difficult to take it out. I spent a good few minutes trying to pry the Kindle out of the case. I believe the case cracked in the process. So I suppose it's good in the sense that the Kindle is very securely in there and is not at risk of slipping out whatsoever. But I'm still disappointed that the case cracked on the edge. I've had it for less than a month and have never dropped my device. I noticed the crack a few days after attempting to remove the Kindle from the case. Nothing else happened that could explain the crack. Everything else about the case is fine. The magnet keeps the lid closed effectively and also locks/unlocks the Kindle. It's thin and light, making everything easy to carry around. A case simply shouldn't crack in the process of removing the device it is intended to protect. Shouldn't be a problem for most people though, since there is very little reason to take the Kindle out once you put it in the case (I removed mine to get at some dust that fell into the cracks)."
3.0,"When it worked, it worked extremely well. Smoking fast extender. However, it would continuously drop the connection from my router requiring a rescan to reestablish the connnection. Not even a reboot would work. Eventually I was no longer able to access the extender wirelessly to rescan and was forced to connect via ethernet. A real pain for its location. But even this stopped working, or was intermittent. Had to reset to factory default in order to connect to it again. I followed the suggestion on Amped's support forum and assigned a static IP address and changed the Channel to 20MHz. This worked........temporarily. But it soon dropped the connection again and I was back to square one. Not to mention changing my router settings created additional problems with my wifi! I highly recommend this extender if you can get it to work. As for me, I replaced it with a Securifi Almond 2015 and have had no problems since. My only regret is the Almond cannot connect or transmit at 5G. But it's still impressively fast, was extremely easy to setup and I have no regrets. I may be looking at an Almond 2015+ when I'm in the market for a new router."
3.0,Nice Case I just don't like the fact that my tablet moves so freely while snapped in place..
3.0,"This keyboard cover is decent quality, however it does muffle the sound of movies, music etc playing from the laptop. It makes typing much less efficient also. I guess this is to be expected with any keyboard cover. I will still be keeping it on whenever possible to protect my laptop from crumbs and spills."
3.0,its very big for me
3.0,"I ordered this piece to retrieve data from two hard drives from a failed desktop computer and transfer to a laptop. Getting it set up was easy, the problem lies with it showing as an available drive. The drives did not showed on neither of my laptops.  Apparently, this docking station is not being recognized by Windows 10, which both of my laptops have. I had to call up my USB stick with load Linux on the laptop for it to see the drives and being able to retrieve the data.<br /><br />In summary, I made it work, but for a person with little experience this would have being hard and may had returned it. If the manufacturer can update it to be seen in Windows 10 that would make it more functional."

The device itself is not really any worse or much better than the Belkin we have used in the past,NTI and a few more.<br /><br />What earned this product 3 stars instead of 5 was my trip down customer service lane. This is a plug and play item, no reason i should have been having such a fight with it but I did. When I got customer service on the line it got much worse.<br /><br />1. If I wanted to call India for tech support, I personally would have skipped the 20 plus minutes of hearing how &#34;Your call is important to us&#34; and dialed direct. This lady had no idea what the hell she was talking about and I am completely certain, 100% sure that she did not have a clue about the product. I had to tell her what the quick start manual said.....unto which i quickly replied &#34;It is your product right? Are you saying that you do not have this information?&#34;<br /><br />2. Screen Reading - Contrary to popular belief, reading a screen an making a mental checkmark of what you have said and in which order is not tech support. I did actually ask her to drop the phone and let someone who knows absolutely anything pick it up. I would normally not get this rude, but after 45 minutes AFTER the 20 minute wait for them to pickup, I was getting kind of frustrated. Having her ask me to start troubleshooting it from the beginning again was the last straw. &#34;Please unplug all the cables and plug them back in.&#34; Me - &#34;Are you sure? This didn't work two other times.&#34; The lady - &#34;Yes please, you need to let me help you.&#34;<br /><br />CLICK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the way with so many of these electronics/tech companies. You look and try to find a good solid product because if you get them on the phone or deal with their tech support in any way, you are hosed.<br /><br />I finally figured out the problem the next day and it was not even with the device. It was with the monitor on the receiver end that was flipping out from the signal coming from the transmitter. New monitor, BAM! It worked. Why it worked half way through the setup and died who knows.<br /><br />The device is in and running. No real issues to speak of. This run is only around 50 feet or so and the picture comes through quite good. No pc hooked to the receiver side, only using a pc on the transmitter and mouse, keyboard and monitor on the receiver.<br /><br />I called tech support to ask 1 question; &#34;I am only calling to make sure I have this thing setup right because I am experiencing weird problems.&#34; Over 1 hour total time and no answers. Total waste."

3.0,"First, to be absolutely clear - *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives.<br /><br />This drive is one of many involved in the fake capacity USB flash drive (and SD memory card) scam. They come in a wide variety of styles - plastic sticks, metal swivels (like this one), silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You may spend a day or several (at typical USB 2.0 speeds), but in teh end, you will find all but the first few GB unreadable or corrupt.<br /><br />Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.ey can be played back.

3.0,Appears much smaller than 7&#34;
3.0,"It doesnt like to act normaly with my PC most of the time. I have to lean really far forward sometimes, even on a full battery, to get close to my bluetooth source.Otherwise, its a pretty neat unit! It fit my needs at the ti9me, and I will probably use it again when I set up my home theater system!"
3.0,"Tablet is ok. Don't like the display at all for pictures. The camera is terrible, grainy and blurry. I used a micro card to see pics taken on a camera (which were excellent) and they also looked grainy and blurry on this tablet. So, I know this tablet can only be used for games for the grand kids. Unfortunately, it does not allow for different profiles so I have to keep it in airplane mode when the grand kids use it to keep them from inadvertently going online. The battery life for now is ok. I have several tablets and this isn't the best by any standard, but it's ok. As I said, it will serve the grand kids."
3.0,I returned this ! I didn't like that it didn't have a brightness button ! U couldn't even see it at night !!
3.0,"It's a little bit noise, Very dificult to install on the mob, I said VERY DIFICULT.<br /><br />There's a metal base in X format which fix the cooler on the motherboard. In this X there's a screw but it doesn't fasten on the cooler base, so, put then togheter without make a mess with the termal paste is a glory.<br /><br />I suggest to see other models, like T3."
3.0,It worked well with the ipad.
3.0,"I did not care for this case, I did not like all the flaps on the back that access the iPad 4 features. It was a heavy case and it did protect the iPad 4 if dropped but I found it hard to attach the screen protector and just did not like it. I bought a supcase that had a built in screen protector and was lighter weight and fit my tablet better."
3.0,"Gets very hot.  :-(  Almost to the point where you have to be careful about picking it up.<br /><br />It's faster than the older ones I had, so I can't say anything bad about the speed."
3.0,It charge slow on the powerful slot.
3.0,"It is well made and looks good but, the speaker holes do not line up. No matter how I put the tablet in."
3.0,Had to turn it in the correct spot to work !
3.0,it wont work on a Dell Optiplex 780
3.0,The paperwhite is a nice devise and is fairly easy to use once you get used to it.  I like the built in light. However having been a devout DX user it is not a DX. I miss my DX and wish the company had continued the product. The paperwhite is not as versatile as the DX and needs wireless conection.  It is not as easy to use as my DX was. Still it is a nice product and hopefully i will get over the loss of my old faithful DX.
3.0,it's so big display..OMG
3.0,"This is not a gaming mouse. It's a fine mouse, but it is just a mouse. The side buttons do not present themselves to the system as mouse buttons. They are directly interpreted as the command they are set to, for example &#34;Back&#34; or &#34;Forward&#34;. You game will not detect them as &#34;Mouse 4&#34; or &#34;Mouse 5&#34;. So, the side buttons are useless in a game."

3.0,"I suddenly needed to replace my 10 year old Airport Extreme Base Station, and this one looked like it might work (I also tried the Belkin AC1200 (Gigabit) and TRENDnet TEW-812DRU...I eventually decided on the TRENDnet).<br /><br />I was primarily looking for router function, and wireless was just icing. I believe I would have been fine with an 802.11n device, but opted for the AC for some future purpose.  that being said, the wireless worked decent enough: both in range and quality.  Also, the configuration UI was pleasant enough.<br /><br />The reason I retuned it was because the router dropped my 50Mb connection from Suddenlink down to about 20 (tested using a single hardwired PC into the switch), in spite of the gigabit WAN port. There might be some configuration reason as to why it dropped, but I wasn't able to locate it with a quick Google search, and didn't want to take the time figure at a reason when I was able to replace the router and instantly get the speeds I was paying for."

3.0,The product was exactly what I needed and worked great but came in a cardboard envelope with no packing materials or anything to prevent it from being damaged.  We were very lucky that the product was functional when it arrived
3.0,"It's a great product in theory, but in the end it wasn't for me. This is my first mac computer, and my old Windows laptop keyboard was full of dog hair (yay for having labs as pets), crumbs, dust, you name it. I decided to get this and put it on my new mac before ever using it, this way I could get used to the new keyboard with it being on. From the start it felt weird to type on, and I was making a lot of typos mainly because the silicone just doesn't bend enough to fully register you're pressing a key. The light does still shine though the cover, but only just, and only noticeable when there's no other light in the room. I'm going to scrap this cover because it's just too weird to type on, and now that I'm typing with it off, I'm loving seeing the actual backlit keyboard."
3.0,like it
3.0,Out of the 3 one has already quit working on me and it's only been a week...they're durable wires and the length is great but they're not compatible with iPhones and don't charge your phone. Not sure what the point of a charger is if it doesn't charge your phone
3.0,STOPPED WORKING 1ST WEEK... WOULDN'T CHARGE- FROZE... SAD PURCHASE
3.0,"Average product. Works as intended. The cover hides half the volume adjusting buttons on the ipad air, so that is a little bit of a pain."
3.0,"This device does not transmit sound as the DisplayPort and HDMI will. It converts the DisplayPort signal to a DVI signal which is sent over HDMI. So if you plan on using this adapter to connect your computer to TV expecting picture and sound, THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK!"
3.0,"Be very careful when you order this screen protector!  I accidentally ordered the wrong one, because it says &#34;Microsoft Surface Pro 3 12 Inch&#34;.  After looking through reviews on several different types of protectors for the Surface Pro 3, I clicked the order button and must have missed the &#34;not&#34; on a separate line in front of those words.  The outside of the packaging says nothing about the size, just &#34;Surface 3 Screen Prote... Display, 2015 Version) New&#34; which I did check to be sure it was right before opening.  I had no way to know it was the wrong size, before I opened it so now I have wasted the price - unless Sparin comes through for me, and lets me exchange it.  We'll see what happens next."
3.0,"There were hiccups on the initial setup. The AP would reboot every couple of minutes. I considered sending it back then, but decided to update the firmware and try some other settings. It has now been stable for a couple months and we love that it covers the whole house!<br /><br />I chose this model because of the price and POE (Power Over Ethernet) support. I just had to run the single Cat-5e cable to my closet in the middle of the house and that cable carries both data and power from my basement office.<br /><br />Update 8 months later: still using the AP on POE. It hasn't rebooted on its own anymore, but I occasionally (once or twice a month) have to reboot it manually. I still think it is worth the price, but wish it was a bit more reliable."
3.0,its okay i highly recommend a new battery and a new graphics card the battery will have shot outs and i'm not the only one that has these problems so the min i got the computer i changed the battery for it didint even bother with the battery

3.0,"I really like the color and it's useful; however, one of the bottom four white pads was not glued on in the right place. It doesn't mess it up, but if you have even a hint of OCD- it's annoying. Overall, I'd say it's a good buy though."
3.0,"I've loved this cover for its versatility and protection, however, the edges have unraveled after 18 months of use. I've requested a replacement since this product has a lifetime warranty. Update: The sellers replaced the first one and the second one has already peeled at the edges and corners after less than two months. Will try a third time in case I&#34;m just getting lemons. Also, the second one did not hold the iPad as securely in the corners. If I dropped it, I feel sure that it wouldn't protect it or keep the cover in place. Downgrading to three stars for now."
3.0,"Sounds great, The wiring is RCA type and solid into the speaker. The older logitech I had used speaker clips I didn't like as is would damage the wire before moving the speaker when bumped. I also like having volume control on the front speaker instead of a remote. The bass control is on the back of the sub which would of been better next to volume.<br />Edit After testing I discovered the speaker with volume control distorts on certain sounds even at low volume. The rest are perfect :/"

3.0,"This device is a great value for the money. The battery life is excellent (around 6-8 hours), the keyboard and mouse are serviceable if not spectacular, and Chrome OS is very easy to learn and greasy-quick for start-up and restart times.<br /><br />My complaints, which are mostly undone by the ridiculously low price, are these:<br />The video processing is minimal. Gaming is not an option, and even Youtube videos struggle on full screen in HD. Use this for email and Drive, not fun.<br />Office and Drive programs still do not play nicely together. Be prepared to have formatting issues when uploading and editing documents.<br />The Chrome Store covers the basics, but is limited.<br />One USB port on the back is annoying. A second would be welcome, especially for plugging in external hard drives (very low internal memory, helped by Google Drive, but still.) or peripherals.<br /><br />A three star review to me is fair for this computer. I like it, especially at the price tag. It saved me as a college student who suddenly found himself down a laptop and needed something economical to finish school. It covers the basics, Chrome OS has its high points, but I would not recommend it as a primary device unless price is the deciding factor."
3.0,"Even with help from the manufacturer, I could not get this to work on neither of my computers. It's not ready for Windows 10 yet, but will be sometime soon. However, it would not work on my Windows 7 laptop either. The customer service from the manufacturer was prompt and detailed, but nothing would work to get this item to operate, so I returned it."

Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information."
3.0,"Bought it for my old Mac laptop. After connecting to the wifi network, the usb adapter is getting hot. The internet connection speed is very slow compared to the wireless card came with the laptop."
3.0,Keyboard seems to take a while to sync.  I type for awhile and nothing happens or I get double letters.<br />mouse is fine.
3.0,"Happy with the device, NOT SO HAPPY with the software interface with Windows 10.  VERY FLAKEY  won't read the RPM's on it's own device, or my MSI GTX 970 vid card installed on a Asus m/b 2011-v3 Intel CPU  The fans spin on the cooler, but don't register in their software.  There is no tweaking of the setup, Everything is default in this Windows 10 setup."
3.0,"I like everything about the Fire HD except watching videos.  I usually use it for reading books, etc - and it's great for that, but when I try to watch an Amazon Prime Video it just bogs down.  I watch a couple of minutes and then it stops to load, the it's good for a couple more minutes and back to reload, and so forth.  I don't think it's my wireless network because I can go to my Kindle app on my Note4 and watch the same movie with no problems.  It just seems that the Fire just doesn't have much processing power. This is my third Kindle and I don't think I'll be buying another - I'll just use the Kindle app on some other device."
3.0,"Among the many PCIe eSATA cards I've purchased so far this one is the most compatible with external RAID enclosures, able to recognize 8 drives over a single cable with port multiplier and transfer to them at reasonable sustained speeds. That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that if your PC is under heavy CPU load, the driver for this card can cause a blue-screen crash that shuts down the PC (it is a fairly rare crash and may take up to 25 minutes of sustained heavy CPU load before it triggers). For this reason I've had it disabled for some time in my PC. I'm hoping the new 4 Channel Vantec might have less crappy drivers."
3.0,"The sound quality and packaging on these headphones are exquisite. There isn't much to say that hasn't been stated in prior reviews, and they feel quite sturdy. The metal frame holding one of the ear cups is bent however and now they do not sit  on my ears properly and sound escaped plus they feel uncomfortable due to the awkward angle the ear cup bows out at. If it isn't wasn't for this defect these would be my favorite headphone."
3.0,Nice typing experience. Fashion design. But why there are BLUE led among the red... Lose two stars for that.
3.0,It's not good enough
3.0,I have a hp envy 15t k200 laptop and when it arrived I found that horizontally it was too narrow and vertically it was just a millimeter more or less to long but other than that it is a decent product.
3.0,"Even though it says new, charge is weak."
3.0,Adequate case. Nothing special.
3.0,Shortly after purchase and giving these headphones a good review the 3.5 jack broke inside the computer. I had some complaints about microphone volume being low dispite internal volume being maxed.
3.0,Have to unplug and plug in every time.
3.0,"I was very satisfied until yesterday, when my speaker completely didn't work... maybe u have an explanation for this"
3.0,It is what it is. :) Good enough for protection around the house or quick travel in a bag.
3.0,It is a sturdy case but hard to remove once on and hard to swipe text.
3.0,"I'm not completely happy with this item. It's quite heavy compared to the Apple competition. Battery life is really short. I had it get stuck in a game and couldn't get out of it for a day. Have no idea why that would happen. This came with no actual manual, you're supposed to look it up online or on the device itself, so what are you supposed to do when it locks up and you can't use it!! Thus I just let the battery finally run down and I turned it completely off and when it recharged I was unstuck. This also gets pretty hot on the back when I'm reading a Kindle book. Packaging of the device when it was shipped was ridiculous. A padded envelope ONLY with the normal carboard box holding the actual device just shaking around in there. I didn't consider that adequate for an electronic device. I had ordered Turkey Jerky at the same time and it came in the standard amazon box with air pillows inside. When I saw the 2 packages I was positive the Fire was in the box and the Jerky was in the padded envelope. Imagine my surprise and dismay when I got them opened. I wasn't even sure the Fire would be usable after all the shaking."
3.0,did not work. supplier promptly refunded my money.
3.0,There are no screws or tape as described. Also does not stay together well. The top falls off easy.
3.0,"Sounds decent, nothing special, bass is horrible, and the shape isn't great. Cannot hide them very easily. The price is very good though, so can't complain too much."
3.0,"I bought this because I did not want to drill holes and tear up drywall to run new wiring to our new T.V.  We set up the new T.V. in the middle of the house where there is no good way to run wiring without opening drywall.<br /><br />The IO GEAR GW3DHDKIT installs in minutes. I have the transmitter setup in a room that already had a Direct TV Genie box running. I have the receiver setup one wall away and about 18 feet away.<br /><br />When it is working it has a great picture and the sound is good too.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Every now and then when you turn on the TV the IOGEAR transmission just starts to flip out. I have noticed it always does this on the IOGEAR channel 8 and 9. I have to turn off the unit to try and reset it. I wish there was a way to make it stay on one channel so I could avoid channel  8 and 9.<br /><br />When I fast forward and sometimes when I pause the Direct TV Genie the IOGEAR starts to look for a new channel and it blanks out the screen for 15-30 seconds while it is doing this and I really hope it does not end up on channel 8 or 9 because I have to turn it off to reset it then. This is very annoying when you are trying to fast forward through commercials, I would say it does this 2 out of 3 times.<br /><br />I have tried moving both the transmitter and receiver to different locations to try and mitigate these problems but to no avail, it is always the same no mater where I put either unit."
3.0,Works fairly well but the green is actually blue.
3.0,It has a nice feel when typing but it is too thick to allow the MacBook Pro to close completely.
3.0,"Did not fit my Infocus 10&#34; tablets.  Easy to return, prompt refund. Thanks!"
3.0,Good for the price. Loud at load.
3.0,"The case I received is NOT the one shown when I placed my order. Lovely to look at and will undoubtedly do well to protect my brand new toy, but as a stand it is useless. It holds my Kindle in landscape but the screen's contents will not re-orient 180 degrees so using it in its correct stand configuration doesn't work and it does not function as a stand in portrait unless folded back with tab folded under (easy to holds, however) and then  placed in another stand. How disappointing!"
3.0,"Great idea...but will not fit if you have an Otter Box case (Galaxy S4,5,or 6)"
3.0,"I couldn't tell from the picture that this provides not protection for the actual ipad.  The keyboard is very nice and works quite well but I'm just not comfortable sending my daughter to school with her ipad unprotected for the sake of having a keyboard.  I'm sending it back, just don't believe in naked devices."
3.0,Doesn't have as much space as I thought it has.
3.0,"I bought 5 of these to give to officemates.  They only worked when they were straight and would not when bent to send the air where you wanted it.  After playing around with it, I got a small bend tat the fan worked but, I also had to move the computer to get the best air flow as if I bent the fan anymore it wouldn't work.  It also has a loud sound. Once I worked this all out, the fan is ok.  I do have 2 out of 5 fans that don't work at all!"
3.0,"It was a really easy setup, but here in DC my xbox is about 10 feet from the window and I get 0 signals. So I am marking it down two starts because it is not very strong."
3.0,"A bit expensive for 3 screws, but i needed them"
3.0,"Didn't work. I'm happy with the price and the quantity; I fully expect something else will convert successfully.  I do not blame the manufacturer for this; it is just the way my computer recognizes a usb keyboard. I'll live. Thanks, Aleratec; you DID do a good job providing a good product."
3.0,"Work perfectly fine. Good noise canceling. I haven't had a chance to try the mic out though. The only problem for me is that they're way to tight on my ears. My head is pretty big and fat though, so you might now have the same issue."
3.0,The mouse wheel automatically jumps when I'm in battle. The mouse is outstanding but the mouse wheel is a whole other story. Too stiff of a mouse wheel and mine seems to be fine but it automatically activates without control.
3.0,"Very nice keyboard, the incline for this is actually a lot more extreme than other keyboards, but my friend that I bought this for likes this feature. The overall feel of this keyboard is good, easy to type on with no weird key placements.<br /><br />Only thing I think that could be improved here is the lights need to be MUCH brighter. They are practically non existent under normal room lighting. There is no brightness level change.  This is one of the main selling points of the keyboard and is very underwhelming."
3.0,Took over 30 days to arrive. I guess that was because is was shipped internationally. I won't order from them again. Units are OK but not what I would call high quality. They work. They were cheap so what can you expect? I got pretty much what I paid for.
3.0,"The cover absorbs whatever oil you have on your hands or fingers, and leaves marks you can't get rid of. The green cover is fairly transluscent and after a few days of using it, there are fingerprint marks all over it."
3.0,I purchased a polyurethane case first.  It sucked!  Now I have the more expensive leather case and it is not much better!!!  Cannot access the on off buttons without taking it out of the case.  They need a better design!!!!!
3.0,Just have to learn how to use
3.0,"It has no protection against collision and if falls, hard to recover data."
3.0,ok
3.0,It was fine and is doing the job it was purchased for.
3.0,I wish that the keyboard cover was the same color as the laptop cover.
3.0,"The mouse is alright; clearly a cheap Logitech clone; vastly inferior build quality - which is fitting for the price point to a certain extent.<br /><br />Mine works alright for now, but shipped with a broken internal part - an internal clip of some kind that snapped off (Image: http://bit.ly/1LFh0mu), that I had to shake down to the butt of the mouse and out through the open battery cover.<br /><br />So, I'm giving it 3 stars because it's \\""okay\\"" - it seems to work well enough; but the build quality is immediately disappointing. The broken clip I had to shake out of the mouse's innards put me over the edge here. That's immediately shoddy."
3.0,"Like the color of cover, but too large for IPad.  Wasn't a snug fit and the cover kept covering up the camera when taking pictures."
3.0,The cords are already giving me trouble. All other items good.
3.0,"This router lets you connect USB drives to act as a media player, but does NOT support DLNA.  You can access the shares on a connected drive from a PC or other networked device, but you will not be able to see or play them using a Roku.  Router works ok otherwise, but very disappointed not to be able to use it as a media player sources for Roku."
3.0,Two defects on screen that looked like bubbles.
3.0,Works well but the size and mechanism are a little clumsy.
3.0,When I got it I loved it as it fit the need.  Nothing really amazing but it was good.
3.0,To short of wifi range
3.0,Was the right cord for the job. Prime shipping would have given it 5 stars
3.0,Doesn't always help in the dead spot which is why I purchased it.
3.0,"Works, but the plug that inserts into the monitor doesn't want to stay in; had to tape it to the back of the monitor. But for the price, it's fine."
3.0,I'm kinda bummed that you have to jump through hoops in order to get Google Play games when it should already be compatible because it is an Anroid
3.0,I can charge my Surface Pro only when it is off.
3.0,It certainly is not an I Pad.  If I had it to do over I would not have gotten a Fire HD 7
3.0,I assume it was good but it did not resolve the problem. they did deliver the product as stated online Thanks eric
3.0,"Functional; however, when attempting to use in the latitude or portrait position, stability of the Tab S is not as good as expected."
3.0,"If you are looking for a sleeve simply to protect and hold the surface pro and the keyboard then this is the product for you!  However, if you are seeking a carrying case to also transport your many cords that are required to project or to give additional USB ports then you can forget this case - it is too small and tight!  I do love the color and the feel of the materiel but it does not meet my needs when I am running to a meeting and need to bring the Surface and it's many many parts."
3.0,Good
3.0,"Color was brilliant. Fit was good too. But once i removed the casing to replace on a new laptop, and it broke. It can be quite a struggle to loosen a fixed case."
3.0,Status lights too small.  Which makes it difficult to determine what's going in if there is a problem.  Otherwise seemed to work O.K.
3.0,Broke rather quickly
3.0,The nice thing is it's place nicely on my keyboard but no more glow in the dark and it's so sticky make you feels uncomfortable when you typing. It just look nice. That's all
3.0,"It works great, but beware!!!  I had mine for 2 years and I didn't get Apple care...  I found out this unit has a bad battery!!!<br /><br />So if you buy this, make sure you get Apple Care!!!  Or get the newer model..."
3.0,Slow response sometimes
3.0,came in a timily maner.
3.0,just another way to spend money.
3.0,Was not exact replcement. Add clearly states the model number it is and it is larger and diff style.
3.0,"Amazing and so convenient. My only complaint is that the end that connects to the wall adapter heats up very quickly and becomes extremely hot. Not sure if I should be concerned, but I am avoiding certain fabrics and materials when charging my devices because of this."
3.0,way bigger than expected
3.0,"It works as a stand, I have an iPad 2 so I don't have to use the cardboard insets, which although nice cardboard are still cardboard. I didn't expect it to be quite as big and clunky as it ended up being. the adjustable part as other have said is just a rubber band around the pole that holds the top part up, it's adjustable, but not dynamically so. I don't intend to use it in bed, but I really wouldn't want it kind of a stretch to expect people to put a giant metal plate under their pillow and then awkwardly slide under the pad holder.  You can swing the holder out of the way, but the whole thing would be incredibly awkward and cumbersome to set up for bed use and if you are just using it as a stand it take up entirely too much space."
3.0,"Thought this would be a great idea, but there's too much movement from the stand when touching the screen. It's kind of like a bobble head."
3.0,o<br /><br />k
3.0,"Just OK.  The case is very thin.  The inside handles only function when they are outside of the zipper, so the case will be open if you plan on using the inside handles.  After looking it over, it doesn't appear to be water resistant.  I expected a little better quality for this price range."
3.0,I just got it Let u all know if it works ...in 6 hrs to full charge
3.0,Made signal slightly stronger
3.0,The two credit card slots were not functional because they were not properly cut or slit during production. And there was a reddish ink? stain on the front cover.
3.0,Been using it at work. No problems in the few weeks I've used it.
3.0,"Tried fitting 4 of these into a Silverstone FT02.  The clearance is pretty tight, and I'm using Silverstone's own sata cables and CP06 for power.  The amount of room between each CP05 connector is just barely enough, and it takes a bit of elbow grease to fit them in place.  I am a bit disappointed in the build quality, as the sata connector for one of them broke when trying to fit it in.  (Ironically, the one at the end, which I didn't apply any pressure to while fitting in.)  It's useless, so for now I'll have to use the original CP05 that came with the case in its place.<br />Since these are all Silverstone products, I'd expect there to be better coordination on size tolerances.  Otherwise, it works as expected and does reduce cable clutter in the end.  Just be careful when putting them in.  Also, you'll have to re-crimp the CP06 sata power cabling.  just flip each connector to the other side of the cable and you should be fine.  (Youtube sata power crimping if you need a guide.)"
3.0,Does not give you the protection you really need but does help a little
3.0,I love it so far.  This is my very first laptop computer.
3.0,"Wasn't able to get the Wireless portion to work much better than the Router alone (TP-Link ArcherC7), but the extra LAN port it allows for made things a lot easier for me, given the distance between the router and the bedroom (roughly 90 feet), along with interceding wall structures."
3.0,"Worked great at first, but here I am one year later and already buying a new one. The main cushion-y part of the strap is badly frayed, and the spring has come out of one of the hooks, so it's constantly coming unstrapped."
3.0,"FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. This drive will destroy your data.<br /><br />Plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.

3.0,ok
3.0,It worked well other than the height was way off (too short). The description was not clear online about the size.
3.0,"The keyboard is delightful, super comfortable, and the separate number pad is super handy.<br /><br />But there are significant issues with &#34;ghosting&#34; where holding down even 2 or 3 keys at the same time can cause weird behavior.<br /><br />For example, a key combination I use frequently - capslock+alt+s (I re-map control to capslock because it's more ergonomic to move my pinky a little bit than to curl it under my wrist) - simply doesn't register at all.  Another combination that I discovered playing a video game: right-arrow+space+d.<br /><br />Many keyboards have issues with ghosting when subjected to stress testing, but this one has a half-dozen combinations I need to consciously work around that I discovered through regular use.  I really hope that Microsoft does another iteration (perhaps with a &#34;gaming&#34; label, since that's what it seems to take to get anti-ghosting configurations) that fixes these issues, because otherwise the keyboard is just fantastic."
3.0,"Didn't do much for me, they look cool though."
3.0,It works good but gets very hot. I wouldn't use it for a long time.
3.0,ok
3.0,"I really liked  a lot of things about this.  It's black and matte, so my high precision mouse really sails over it.  It's thin, so I don't feel like I'm scrolling on marshmallow. and it covers a large space, so I have plenty of room to maneuver.<br /><br />BUT...it's not the most durable.  After just a few month, the edges are curling where my wrist often sits, annoying the heck out of me and causing the mousepad to move."
3.0,"Here's the thing. This camera is the best HD webcam out there. Better than Microsoft's even. But it has a massive issue: it is NOT supported on the Mac (OS X). Seriously Logitech? It's just absolutely ridiculous they wouldn't support Mac. It's stupid even - I mean, don't they wanna sell more cameras and make more money? -<br /><br />On a Mac, the camera will work as a generic webcam device with Skype. It also works with Wirecast. You can record with Quicktime too - but you won't get any of the setting goodness needed to get the best out of it. Download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech from the AppStore and you will get a bit more. There's an app called Webcam Settings too (3rd party - $7.99) which will give you even more control... but this all feels too hacky... not officially supported. Also, for my life, I wasn't able to make this camera be recognized by Adobe Premiere 2015 or by iMovie so it's pretty unusable for me..."
3.0,Do not ecpect to get good fps at 1080p and heavy textures But for games that dont require much it is good for
3.0,Seems to have some problems.  Freezes u.p Deletes messages at random..  Just downloaded latest version of operating system.  If this does not solve the problem will try Apple store.
3.0,"I was looking for a laptop mainly for gaming and for school, and it fits both needs. For this price, this laptop can run big games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Garry's Mod, Rocket League, and more, all at 100 fps on average! This is the best cheap option out there. I also really love the new Windows 10 OS. It's simple to use, and all in all pretty aesthetically appealing. The only flaws are that it has a slow boot-up, due to the lack of a solid state drive, and occasionally the internet is slow as well, but maybe it's just mine. I highly recommend this, and I took one star off just because of the boot-up.  EDIT: It's about a year and 3 months after I bought it, and it is not holding up well. I didn't expect it to hold up perfectly for so long, but at this point it is really really slow. I had to dock another star due to ho poorly it is holding up."
3.0,I'm not a fan of the matte after trying it. Really degrades the screen resolution.
3.0,I cannot believe I paid $25.49 for what is clearly a $5.00 product.  It cam without batteries that were to have been included so I don't even know that it is really worth even $5.00. This order was a learning experience for me.  I ordered the reading light on August 5 and it arrived on August 31.  Why?  Because it shipped from China.  Shame on me.  I will now pay much closer attention to where my money is going.
3.0,Good!
3.0,"Over the past 3 years I've had 2 sets of these headphones as my primary mic/speakers on work laptops. Both sets were supplied by my employer so I won't show up as a verified purchaser.<br /><br />I've found the headsets to be very comfortable to wear for long durations of time (sometimes the bulk of the business day) and found the audio and mic capabilities perfectly suited for what I was doing - teleconferencing via Webex/Skype etc.<br /><br />The only reason this is not a 5 star review is a significant one; both sets have snapped after 1-1.5 years use. The small plastic &#34;slider&#34; that allows you to extend the headset seems to be the weak part here. I don't pull these things apart far to get them on my head, and I definitely don't have them set too small for my head, but both sets have died the same way. Looking for an alternative rather than a third set from my employer for now."
3.0,"Nice case & fits ok but covers over control buttons, speakers, & charging port."
3.0,The good news is that one of the tablets don't work & I got a full refund. Thanks to Paypal great customer service skills!!!!
3.0,Nice color and the magnetic closure was nice..... it just didn't have all the features I wanted so returned it.
3.0,looks good feels cheaply made and sound is TERRIBLE. but it looks cool ill give it that
3.0,I bought a white one and a black one. The white one works perfectly but I'm having problems out of the black one.
3.0,"The installation of this glass screen went smooth.  The only issue I am finding is that it has chipped on the edges in 3 different locations.  First one was a little after installing, without dropping or bumping it.  I have had a few other glass screens and haven't had an issue with chipping.  Might be just the one I received, but be careful."
3.0,Gift to granddaughter for college and it is too bulky and combursion for easy mobility
3.0,The screen is easy to read even in sunlight.  Text is very clear and the functionality is straight forward.  It's a nice reader.  I do notice black shadowing at the bottom of the screen.  The battery life given is also based on 30 minutes reading time a day when in actuality it is 12 to 16 hours if the device is on constant.<br /><br />I would buy again.
3.0,Would have gave it five stars but the install instructions are very limited so my AFN sd card is still running slow
3.0,Windows not genuine on this but for 125$ that's still a deal
3.0,"There were a lot of positive reviews for such a great price, but now I realize why it's inexpensive. It cuts out frequently - at least 3-4 times in one viewing session. It will disconnect from my wifi then reconnect, which isn't generally a problem unless I'm streaming Netflix; then it interrupts what I'm watching and I have to go back into my Netflix app on my phone and Chromecast it and restart the show. It's more annoying than anything else. I can deal with it for now, but it's inconvenient to say the least."
3.0,Plug missing - returned
3.0,that's okay.
3.0,Had to keep this (no return) even though I received a new camera and no longer needed it.  Great option for my 13 yr old camera but wish I could have returned it...
3.0,Did not last long. Got 1 year out of it before it was at 25% life at full charge
3.0,"I love the PC, worked like a dream for the first couple months, but then I made he mistake of upgrading to windows 10, it gave me the black screen of death and I still not have been able to fix it."
3.0,"After receiving the Folio, it was not what I expected.  I was looking for a case which housed the total Ipad.  I then contacted Zagg and purchased the type of case I was looking to buy.  This does not reflect on your service, but, I should have researched it a little further."
3.0,"It worked right out of the box.  No missing parts or visible damage.  It came on time as promised.  It immediately recognized my WiFi network and connected without issues.  Other than the huge windows updates that came after initiation, it worked OK right away.  I primarily purchased this laptop because it still has the windows 7 operating system and the relatively fast four core AMD processor.  It could be a really nice laptop, but HP fell short on this one!<br /><br />The reason for the three stars is two fold.  1-  Although the description clearly states that it has a USB3 port, it does not!  2-  It is agonizingly slow.  I would have returned it primarily for reason #1, but I really needed it for work and could not wait for the return and replacement delays.<br /><br />On the positive side, it has a nice keyboard, well functioning track pad and a nice display when you look at it straight on.  It has very little tolerance for off angle viewing.<br /><br />It claims that there is a user replaceable RAM slot.  But I don't dare open the back because it does not have a separate opening for access to RAM and the hard drive.  Adding a second RAM and updating the HDD to an SSD would probably make this a more usable laptop.<br /><br />Bernie"
3.0,Mine doesn't fit perfectly some people claim.  I can't get it to snap on.  Afraid I will damage the screen if I press too hard. The keyboard  is nice.
3.0,It was not the quality of leather I expected but the product is well designed and functional ....  I would consider that leather moderate quality ...  If you're looking for I am high-quality this is not that ...  go buy Bosca.
3.0,"I remember getting mine for Christmas a couple years ago, I was excited because it was the first one I've ever gotten, I've used it constantly but have come into troubles. Among my first couple of uses with it, it just stopped working in a particular area. After a while I got used to it, with a couple frustrations here and there due to the urgency of what I was working on. Sometimes it would bug out and stop working completely for a couple of moments. Today it stopped working after a few minutes of working with it. I had tried multiple things to get it to work, such as unplugging it and then putting it back in, as well as restarting my computer but it just wouldn't work, I'm hoping this is just today, I have too much to do with it for it to stop now. I remember trying to contact customer service at one point in time, but I couldn't answer all of the questions they had asked me, so I couldn't get my issue resolved. It's good, but I wish I could have a less buggy tablet."
3.0,Good unit but does not work with newer versions of MAC operating systems. I had to buy a separate router to use it which has to be pregrammed with each wifi that I connect with.
3.0,It is good.
3.0,It is nice but I cant find the stuff I had on my old Kindle fire.
3.0,"I purchased this battery about 17 months ago and I've had right at 224 charge cycles on this battery. I felt this was an appropriate time to do a review because it's right when the warranty expires.  I would say this battery is average or a little below compared to the OEM battery. According to Apple website the OEM battery should get 300 cycles with an average lifespan of about 2 1/2 - 3 hours (see attached image). I'm at 224 cycles on my Anker battery and I get about an hour and fifteen minutes of use time. This is just minimal usage with the screen all the way down while I'm in class.  I feel like I should still be getting a little bit more usage out of this battery, but overall its ok.[[ASIN:B0075ZZUQ2 Anker New Laptop Battery for Macbook 13&#34; Apple A1185 A1181 MA254 MA255 MA472 MA561 MA566 MA700 MA701 MB061 MB062 Series - 18 Months Warranty [Li-polymer 3-cell 5600mAh]]]"
3.0,ok
3.0,"For the price it's fine, it's built cheaply. I bought 5 of them for resale and 2 of them have had the fans come off the plastic mounting. A little super glue fixed it but hey."
3.0,It's very confusing to install & directions are very complicated...  May return it...
3.0,"First problem: The tablet restarts games frequently. Second: I only recently bought it and it will not work properly. It has stopped responding to my touch. It is fully charged and the screen is on, but it won't sense my touch."
3.0,"They are not as confortable as I wished. After a while my ears hurt; I use glasses, so it's only worst. The sound and mic are awesome, but I can't use then for too ling without feeling disconfort. The older version was better, I wished they would still sell then."
3.0,"This protects my keys well, but turns them a grey color. It also is less-flexible than other brands I have used and thus I have to press harder to type."
3.0,Nice cover
3.0,it is OK.  Nothing to wow one over.
3.0,"Been using this keyboard for about a year and a half now. No wires is great and stays charged. Would have given it more stars but the lack of a caps on light really annoying me now, especially when you need to constantly enter in passwords and can't see if it's in lower or upper. Always have to open text edit or type somewhere else to see what I have. Never thought it would be a deal breaker but I would reconsider this purchase if need to be replaced at some time. Yes, its that annoying."
3.0,"for the price it's okay, processor can become bogged at times but for streaming Netflix or playing games for small kids it does the job."
3.0,"I bought 2 of these, one still works but the other one broke within 1 month."
3.0,"Tape didn't stick that well, but came fast and was just the right size!!"
3.0,"This fixed our problem but arrived with a banged up carrier and chipped system board corners. We were unable to do a drop in installation because of the bent motherboard carrier, which required us to remove the system board from the metal carrier and swap out the metal carrier with the one that was in the dead server. We had to replace the button CMOS battery (not a big deal) but this did work flawlessly after installed."
3.0,Nice case but has a surrounding plastic clip to hold Fire and leather exterior. Does not fold as comfortably as a simpler case I had with my earlier Kindle which had elastic corners that held the device.
3.0,"Good for an inexpensive tablet. Can not complain for that. It is, however, slow."
3.0,"Works well but has a petroleum-like smell that hasn't gone away in over a month of airing out. Don't have time before trip to test a different one, so will use and then discard."
3.0,"Great remote, but died a little over 1 month after buying it. No warranty other than Amazon 30 day return policy."
3.0,Good product.  Pyramid configuration doesn't hold well.  iPad slides flats.
3.0,"The product was fine.  However, it was not delivered as promised...it was delivered a day late.  I know that doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you pay extra for it to be delivered by a certain date...that is what I expect."
3.0,"only two out of the three worked, but hey I had two spear. My family always is in need of one."
3.0,"This works, but the manufacturing was a trifle sloppy, as I had to trim some excess plastic to fit some connectors. Other than that, it does what it says, without costing an arm and a leg."
3.0,much slower charge from the charger that came with the power pack
3.0,"The mouse arrived on time and worked wonderfully after downloading the software from the Korean website listed on the boxed packaging. I play RTS games such as League of Legends and Star Craft so it was perfect for my needs in allowing multiple profiles to configure my buttons for each game. I loved that this mouse was a little heavier than a usual mouse and after 13 hours of play a day, was fairly comfortable to use. However, the mouse has recently died on me and no matter how much I eject the mouse and then reinsert it into the usb port, it remains to be nonresponsive. I've only had the mouse since May, 2015 and am disappointed that it died."
3.0,"Decent sound, weird interface for setting up the balance of sound. The headset itself is very comfortable and decent weight. The software that came with the headset doesn't work well with Windows 10, however it seemed to work while I had Windows 7 installed. Would recommend for those not willing to spend anymore, but keep in mind that it has some strange interface / software quirks."
3.0,"I wanted an inexpensive cover for this tablet, and this one fits that need well.  This cover is very reasonably priced and the design is good - very functional.  Material quality is decent - it will probably hold up pretty well - and build-quality (stitching and cuts) are quite nice for the price.  The material is not extremely soft.  It feels a little cheap, but then it IS a very inexpensive cover - so I won't deduct a star for that.  My only deduction is because it isn't available in a tan or brown color.  Also, my cover was shipped in a thin, soft mailer and was deformed (bowed), with bent corners when it arrived.  I believe this will be okay with time, as the case was not actually damaged (otherwise I would have filed a claim).  It will just take time to regain its original, flat shape.  For the vendor, I would just suggest shipping these in a more rigid container.  Overall, this case is a good value and it fits the tablet very well."
3.0,"Perfect travel companion for your files and laptop bag. It's a very sturdy nylon and you can tell it's quality. It's wide enough to fit all my files and cords. The front pocket is great for the extras and the handles have a good grip. My only thing is the very sad shoulder strap. You would think after seeing this bag that the shoulder strap would be as good as the rest of the product but it's flimsy and digs into your shoulder because it can't hold the weight. Also, we don't need to see the name brand smack dab on the front. That cheapens the product making it seem like it was a free give away at a convention."
3.0,"This item was great-- my daughter opened it at her birthday dinner and was able to use it immediately!  It arrived already charged.  Very nice!  But I got this with the understanding that there would be a 2-year warrantee that comes.  She is 8 and I'm worried it will break at some point.  I understand the warrantee is very good, but I don't se any indication that I actually got the warrantee.  The description when I placed it in the cart said that the warrantee was in the bundle-- with the cover-- but now all I see is the kindle and the cover.  Do I have the warrantee?  If there is a problem, whom do I contact?"
3.0,"Right now I am only give it 3 stars because I have not really used it a lot and I am not very tech oriented.  So it will take me a while to give you a honest report on the Kindle Voyage.  I will say I do love the case I bought for the Kindle it is a Vintage case made of PU Leather.  I have no idea<br />what PU Leather is but it is very well made and holds and protects the Kindle quite well.  I will say I am not happy with the color purple I choose as it is darker than the picture.  I would have choose the turquoise one if I had known that the purple was that dark.  On the computer it looked like a nice<br />royal purple but upon receiving it, it turned out to be a dark purple.  But hey for $12.95 I cant complain and it is too much trouble to send back for just<br />the color."
3.0,"I like my other one better, the only reason I had to buy another was the fan went. The base on this one is too light"
3.0,"the clasps were a little glitchy, but I was able to file down the extra plastic.great value for the price!"
3.0,"Descent headphones.  Good for gaming such as trying to hear bullets fly by and for music; But, its missing the bass and may sound somewhat flat when watching movies.  Treble is very good on the other side and bullet like sound should be crisp.  On the downside the volume knob is very tiny it would have been better if it were in the headset.  The headset also feels like it was made for a kid's ears.  Over time you'll have to re-adjust it and may give you discomfort on the ears since it won't cover the full ear."
3.0,"I've had this case for about eight months now and I have to say, I'm not terribly impressed. I'd like to start by saying that I'm not hard on my computer. I never travel long distance with it and it rarely, if ever, leaves my house. A few weeks in to my use two of the little pads on the bottom half of the case, the ones that keep the computer from scratching the surface beneath it, popped off. I was able to superglue them back on and thus far they've held. A month in one of the clips that keeps the bottom case attached completely broke off. Now I have to fight to keep the bottom case on and it's constantly collecting crumbs and other nastiness between the case and my computer. I don't even eat over my laptop, so yeah, gross. I also dinged one corner of the top case when I was moving it from my desk, creating a little crack in the plastic, which has since spread and even chipped off an entire chunk of the case. Nothing like putting duct tape on your computer.<br /><br />To be honest, I think this case is exactly the same as the cases you see here on Amazon for ten or twelve dollars. My mom purchased a case for half the price of the Kuzy and it looks identical (minus the Kuzy logo). I'd hoped that with the slightly steeper price this would have equated to a slightly better quality case, but mine is practically coming apart and my mother's is still in decent condition. In fairness I think the case has done its job at protecting my computer. I can't verify that, though, because I'm pretty sure if I take the case off now it will fall apart.<br /><br />To sum up: if you want a temporary cheap case, buy a cheaper one than this, because honestly it's exactly the same and not worth the extra eight or ten bucks."
3.0,Not resistant to permormanse live or workof field
3.0,I Returned this because it was too compact it was uncomfortable to type or game on. If I got use to it might have been a nice keyboard it was well built just not well designed. I ended up buying another keyboard from corsair the k70.

Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

3.0,"I bought this laptop (Asus calls it a notebook), because I needed a device that had USB ports so I could program remote controls in the field. The USB ports failed after 4 months. I called Asus support, who by the way are excellent, and tried about five different things including reinstalling the BOIS. Nothing worked so on my 3rd. call to them they suggested a total system reset and assured me that would fix the problem. It didn't. So now I guess I will be sending it back to get a replacement. Asus support is EXCELLENT. It's not their fault the computer is defective. I'm certain I will be able to get a new computer because when I purchased it through Amazon.com it came with a 1 year guarantee against fire, water, dropping, or any other mishap that might happen, plus it's still in warranty. One thing I hate about this computer other than Windows 8.1 is you have to hold down the function key and volume up/down to adjust the volume. Really? Two fingers to adjust the volume? Plus these keys are on opposite ends of the keyboard, a really poor design. The battery life seemed to shorten considerably since I purchased it. At first it lasted about 7 hours, 10.5 months later I only get about 3 hours out of it. All in all it's about what I expected from a $200 computer. If you just need a basic computer it's not bad."
3.0,"The middle button is extremely sensitive. I have mine set to bring up the Start Menu on a double tap, and every bump with my middle finger seems to activate it. It also took me more than twenty minutes to get it to go into pairing mode. The bottom button is extremely difficult to work with, and the &#34;light&#34; that shows it's in pairing mode actually comes on AFTER pairing mode is activated, not AS pairing mode is activated. (In other words, by waiting for the light, I was holding the button on too long, and the mouse was power cycling off.)<br /><br />Kind of annoying that a mouse manufactured by Microsoft IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MICROSOFT MOUSE AND KEYBOARD CENTER! Seriously, you can't make your own products work together? In order to customize it, you have to download an APP from the Microsoft store. So far, the app ONLY allows you to customize the middle button and scrolling rates/feedback volume. I expected, for a mouse that retails for $64, to be able to set a two or three button click as well.<br /><br />I like that it seems to have less lag than the cheaper Optimal Shop one on my Win10 tablet. It also loses connection less frequently. I like that it flattens out, but the sensitivity of the middle button remains a concern. Hopefully I'll get used to it, or Microsoft will recognize that maybe their products should work together and allow the Keyboard and Mouse center to work with it."
3.0,Seems cheap and flimsy

3.0,"I love the concept of the Logitech Headset. It is seriously lacking in execution in one critical area. The wire that plugs into the computer or phone is very delicate. Extremely fragile. Even with careful handling expect it to last 2 months at best. At this price however, it's worth it. Sound quality is excellent and the microphone works great. If you do not like earbuds this is a decent alternative. Remember to handle the plugin wire gingerly."
3.0,"It's fine, it's not very far reaching though."
3.0,"Ordered 7 of these monitors. None had dead pixels or flaws. Display is fine. The biggest issue I had with these monitors is that vertical part of the stand cannot be removed. I was very surprised to find that the horizontal base comes off and that's it. I mounted these displays on an articulating wall mount using the 100mm VESA mounting holes. As a result, the vertical piece sticks down behind and below the monitor. Bottom line, if you're wanting to mount this monitor, you'll have and unattractive black &#34;handle&#34; sticking down."
3.0,Instructions are there but vague. I will try the removable ones.

3.0,"I've owned a number of tablets over the years.  Most recently the 2012 version of the Nexus 7.  I decided I wanted to go back to the larger 10.1&#34; size,  but wanted to keep the cost low.  After looking around,  reading reviews and specs,  I decided to go with the A10X.<br /><br />Anything written here has to take one thing into account,  and that is:  you get what you pay for.  I spent about $68 for the tablet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The price.<br />*The wifi is excellent.  I use it a lot for Netflix and Vudu and I'm very happy with the performance.<br />*Along with that,  the quad core A33 processor seems fast.  I have no complaints about what I've seen it do.<br />*Bluetooth works perfectly.  Connected to my headphones with ease.<br />*Though plastic,  it seems to be solidly made,  and is rather lightweight.<br />*A good size,  5000mAh battery.  I don't plug in the charger regularly,  and it's lasted me for a lengthy period.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The screen.  At 1020x600 pixels,  the colors and resolution are miserable.  Viewing angle are,  to put it nicely..... horrible.  Straight on,  the tablet picture isn't bad,  though again,  colors are fairly washed out.<br />*Compatibility.  I've tested some games and they work fine.  On the other hand,  I play The Simpsons: Tapped Out on my other tablet,  and it does nothing but force close on the A10X.  Very annoying.<br />*Charging is through a cable provided,  not the USB,  as with most tablets.  If something happens to the charger,  you can probably find another,  but not as convenient.<br /><br />Is this tablet a bad buy?  Not if you're looking for something that is very low price,  and does the basics.  For someone looking for a first time tablet,  you could find worse.  For a seasoned tablet owner,  you will probable find it lacking.<br /><br />One last note.  Please don't trust reviewers that say they got a review copy and are doing an honest review.  They're not."
3.0,"Very good for the price. I like that it is glare-free. I prefer the controls on the original Kindle, especially the buttons on the sides. Newer kindle has touch screen to change pages which doesn't work very well when using a waterproof bag. Convenient size but screen is too sensitive to touch."
3.0,Works as expected.
3.0,I loved the product but it broke after a few months & then it was too late to get a new one.  :(
3.0,I returned it because it wasn't what I was looking for.
3.0,"This in OK headset, it will work for about six months, then the sound starts to get scratchy"
3.0,ok  it works.....gets hot

3.0,Doesnt work the best with windows 10 I have had a few issues but it seems to work very very well.
3.0,"Won't stay connected to the WiFi, am having to constantly log in no matter where I am (public, home, etc)."
3.0,"Lasted me a year. Up until about a month ago it worked terrifically for me and I had no complaints. Cheap and simple. It met my simple needs for Dota, CS:GO, and other less intensive games. Now the wire is beginning to fail and if the usb or the wire near the usb gets even gently moved it has trouble reconnecting to my computer. Not great but it's okay. Still works, but I'm replacing it because it can be a pain."
3.0,"Works. Very slow. Android is always updating apps, which leads to screen lockup."
3.0,i have installations problems
3.0,"Did not fit my need of wanting a hot spot closer to my primary computer, but appeared to be made well and installation ease was moderate."
3.0,"Headset is comfortable even for long duration use. Sound quality is very good. Battery life was alright, usually around 4-6 hours of use, if charged while in use took about as much time to reach full charge again. Mic was plagued by issues since unboxing, driver issues with Windows 8/10 not picking up the mic as a recording device. On the same note, Windows had issues at first with the wireless connection, but after troubleshooting there were no further issues. On/off button isn't an analog switch, needs to be held down 3-5 sec to turn on/off. On/off button worked inconsistently, some days worked instantly on first try, others took multiple attempts holding down button longer each time. Overall decent headset, but I would recommend other similar headsets."
3.0,"Touch difficult to use, mostly windows. Has refused to start up twice,"
3.0,I bought this for a budget gaming PC and it's great so far. Overclocking is kind of subpar on this and the BIOS is terrible to use. If you can get over the bad BIOS and overclocking then this board if for you.
3.0,My laptop wireless card is better than this
3.0,"Works fine, but lacks the customizable features. Not compatible with OpenWRT nor DD-WRT. So you cannot expect more from it other than a router."
3.0,"I purchased these usb cables as replacement cables for our 3 Kindle Fires and my new S6 Edge.  I love the fact that the cables come in different colors as it is easy for my kids and myself to recognize which charger is ours.  The feel of the cable is very nice and they are very flexible.  However, for our Kindle Fires and for my phone I have fast chargers.  When I replace this cable (while still using the fast charging power adapters) with either Kindle's fast charger cable or my phone's fast charger cable I get a notification stating that my device is connected to a low power charger.  Interestingly enough if I replace the cables back to the originals that came with the devices my chargers function fast as expected.  I'm not sure how or why these cables are causing that issue but it is a pain unless we are charging them overnight while we are sleeping since they aren't in use.  Another issue we encountered was these cables not holding a snug fit into the devices we used them on and they were easy to fall out of the port.  Overall these cables aren't bad but they certainly aren't the best.  These would work great for PC use but I can't say I would really recommend them for charging use given our experiences with multiple devices."
3.0,Color is supberbe but it was not the right size
3.0,Quality seems to be good but I could not see the keys in the dark.  This keyboard cover blocks the keyboard  light.
3.0,"I bought this yoke to use it in my Flight Simulator Software in my Mac (X-plane). The quality is quite good although it came with a very wide &#34;null zone&#34; which means there is a very large neutral area where the X and Y axis do not move at all (pitch and roll in an airplane). This is not normal in any other joystick/Yoke since most of them replicate a real airplane yoke which in real life have a little or almost no &#34;null zone&#34;. After adjusting any possible option in X-plane software I called tech support who offered me good help but no other solution that to send it back in order to be repaired under warranty.<br />Reading other past reviews I realized that this issue is an old one (over 3 years old issue) and I can´t understand why Saitek has not addressed it yet!<br />If we leave aside the &#34;large null zone&#34; issue in X and Y axis, the unit has an excellent quality and good functionality. The three lever control is smooth and works awesome.<br />Saitek/Mad Catz: I think it is time for you to review your program code in the internal electronics! This is not a potentiometer or mechanical issue but a firmware  issue. Please check other threads about this issue which has been solved by other users using bypassing the original USB controller and using an alternate controller with excellent results (Leo Bodnar´s BU836A 12 Bit Joystick Controller."
3.0,The only thing I don't like about this is the 90 by the ball/swivel. If that were a hinge or optional straight this product would be the shiznit. It really limits where I can locate the mount and still have it hold the iPad Air 2 at a decent enough angle to still be convenient.
3.0,It does not hold the charge as much as I expected. if it goes on like this I have to return it
3.0,"I was looking for a replacement for the spare mouse I carry in my bag.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot because this is my &#34;spare&#34; and not my daily use one.  The thing I liked about this one was the fact that you could place the receiver in the back of the mouse.  On the previous model I was using I had to remove the battery cover to access the holder slot for the receiver.<br /><br />So I ordered this unit.  When I got it, it just felt cheap and not as well made as the previous mouse.  It takes two AAA batteries instead of the standard single AA all my other mice had.  The on/off button is recessed so you have to use a pocket knife to turn it on and off.  For someone that uses this mouse for their bag turning it on and off is a requirement and always having to pull out the pocket knife or find a sharp object to turn it off is not always practical.  After setup the right and left mouse buttons would not work.  It was just not what I expected.  So I dinged it 2 stars for those things.  Next time I will probably just spend a few dollars more and get the Amazon basics wireless mouse I was using before."
3.0,These do the job transferring files to sewing machine!  Just a little disappointed that the cover does not stay in place.
3.0,The only thing I don't like about this adapter is that the plug-in prongs don't retract in the power box like the original adapter that came with the surface. I wish my puppy didn't find the original adapter and chew it up.
3.0,It is made very well but the microphone does not work like it should with my computer
3.0,Looks good
3.0,It only charges my laptop up to 93% and stops.
3.0,"It worked, however my son destoroyed it in days. Not sure how, but it didn't hold up. I know it is not supposed to go through whatever he did to it, but still. I'm sure if it is used properly it would be different, but it easily broke by an 8 year old."
3.0,Great display.
3.0,Works very well
3.0,"It was very nice in many ways; but the GPS did not function well so I returned it.  If you do not plan to use the GPS, it's a Great tablet.  It is a true GPS, but it would lose contact with the satellites."
3.0,Bottom portion of the case does not stay on very well. Top portion is a great fit. Not sure if I can recommend this case.   **Update 11/26/15** It's only been a few month and the case has a small crack already from just normal usage. My MBP has never been dropped so I dont know how there's a crack on the case.
3.0,"I've been a lifelong fan of HP, but this is probably the worst computer I've ever gotten from them.  At least once a week, it encounters a problem and shuts down while I have important things open that I'm working on (this has been happening since I got it from the box).  This is probably the biggest issue.  Besides that, several drivers have had to be reinstalled since I bought it, just a few months ago.  The touchscreen is really too heavy for the keyboard, and as a result it tends to fall backward on any soft surface (like my lap), and is very tippy on hard surfaces too.  The touchscreen is okay...but it tends to be a bit &#34;sticky&#34;.  It's not glass like most smartphones are, so my finger tends to drag and leave smudges much more easily, and after a while of using it, the touchscreen gets jumpy and buggy because of this.  It also makes it hard to be precise with the touchscreen.  The power button is quite difficult to use as well - sometimes if it's on sleep, I press it and the computer comes back immediately.  Other times, I press it and nothing happens after a few moments, so I end up pressing it a few times trying to make it come back to life and the computer inevitably ends up restarting itself (again a pain).  Also, and this is such a tiny issue, but has bugged me - about two weeks after I got it, one of the rubber feet fell off the bottom, so now it's a bit lopsided, even though it's still quite new.  All in all, this is just not HP's best offering at all."
3.0,"I've been using this keyboard for about a week, and overall, I like it just fine. The case fits my iPad Air 2 perfectly, and closes snugly. Seems to hold a charge well, and the swivel works smoothly in both the horizontal and vertical positions. The viewing angle works for me too. One thing I have learned - the cover only closes properly if the horizontal orientation is such that the home button is on the right. Although you can position it to be on the left, the case won't close properly that way.<br /><br />It is MUCH less expensive than similar keyboard/cases, and I assume that the materials used are why. My &#34;a&#34; key has gotten stuck a couple of times, and I think it is because of the plastic used. But -- so far so good. Comes with a 6 month warranty and a mini USB charger."
3.0,This product looks good. The only thing I don't like is its a bit harder to type on it because the silicone over the keys seem to be a bit loose. But it may be something I can get used to.
3.0,"i wish there is a way to turn off touch screen, then turn it on depending on my use. Also, battery keeps running down. I either have not figured out how to turn off something or it stays &#34;on&#34; in spite of being in AIRPLANE mode when not using amazon store.  suggestions"
3.0,"Not an original Drobo power supply, but it does work. Also, power supply delivered does not match the photo. They appear to be using a photo of the original Drobo power supply, which is not what they are selling. Over-priced for a third-party product."

3.0,"I believe that this cooling stand will work quite well for some and so I urge you to know what you are purchasing and read both specs and reviews to determine whether you fall into that category.  That being said, I see both positives and negatives to this design and I'll give my impressions based on having tested several laptop coolers over the years.  To begin with, I almost always use a cooling stand when doing any real work as I am running a high end graphics laptop that runs on the warmer side (with a high end graphics and two HDD's) and is housed in an aluminum case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The stand is relatively sturdy.  It is a mixture of some type of metal and plastic.  It is heavy enough not to feel cheap and light enough not to be off-putting.  The fans are fairly large and for the most part cover each of the corners to the middle of the stand giving it a large area of coverage (for fan effectiveness, please continue reading below).<br /><br />The stand comes with a standalone braided usb cable (which should help with wear and tear) which gives plenty of reach from the back of the stand where the USB inputs are to any USB input on your laptop.  You will also find the fan controls on the back of the stand near the USB inputs.  There is cord management on the bottom center of the stand which is convenient as the USB used to power the stand is not connected permanently on one side and could get lost otherwise.<br /><br />There are two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand that are meant to keep the fans off whatever surface the stand is resting on.  This is a great feature as it increases air flow around the fans on the bottom of the stand which is especially important if you're using this, for example, on your bed on top of a comforter which would leave no space between the bottom of the stand and the material.  These &#34;feet&#34; are plastic and while they seem sturdy, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over the long run. There are also two feet on the top of the laptop (the side that the laptop sits on) which are smaller and also made of plastic.  There is no documentation with the stand to explain what these two smaller feet are for and I can only assume it's to counter the slant that is created by the feet on the bottom of the stand (basically, it helps the laptop to sit more flat relative to the surface the cooling stand is on).  I've not seen this feature on any of the cooling stands I've used before and I think that it is a smart idea as I do not always want a significant slant when typing as it can cause discomfort in one's wrists (see more on this below).<br /><br />Finally, the 12-month warranty the AMNIE offers is a very nice feature and I appreciate a company standing behind their products.  Could it be longer?  Any warranty could always be longer, but I believe at this price point $25-$30, a one-year warranty is absolutely appropriate and one could even argue it's more than appropriate when many electronic components come with 90-day warranties.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I found the dimensions of this product to be less than 16&#34; x 11&#34; (and the dimensions are actually listed as slightly bigger than that online).  I wish that I had taken a picture of this before returning the product, but I was more concerned with getting a product that would work for my needs as soon as possible.  This was a significant issue for me as the description states that it supports a 17&#34; laptop, which I have (I actually pulled out a measuring tape and measured the length and width prior to ordering for this very reason).  Had the measurements been spot on, it would have fit perfectly, however it does not.  The irregular shape of the stand also adds to issue because a slight overhand is compounded in the areas where the shape angles in towards the center of the stand (in the middle of each side).<br /><br />With regards to the two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand, as I mention above, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over time.  With regards to the two smaller feet on the top of the stand, I quickly found a design fault.  Being that they are smooth plastic and most bottoms on laptop are metal or some other smooth surface, there is absolutely no traction/friction and a laptop could easily side off of these feet if, for example, it was accidentally bumped or while you are moving the stand and laptop.  It would have been a simple addition to add a rubber-like pad or some other material/coating on the end of those feet which would create friction.  This is a real surprising oversight on the designer's part.  Unfortunately, I did not take note of whether this issue exists on the bottom set of feet.  However, I feel that this would be less of an issue due to the fact that the feet are larger and therefore have a larger surface area and also have the weight of the stand and the laptop bearing down on them which would impact their stability in this area.<br /><br />This is personal preference of course, and I will explain why, but I feel that the stand-alone USB power cable is less than ideal.  I truly disliked the fact that the cable used to power the stand, a USB cable, is not connected permanently to the cooling stand.  You might conclude that not being permanently connection makes it easier to pack up and store and not worry about damaging the connection, but if it were permanently attached, there is no need to have such a vulnerable connection.  The connection could be made internally and the only thing protruding would be a malleable cable with one usb connection.  This is a design choice of course, but it could become problematic because it makes the cable easier to lose.  How many times have you lost or forgotten a cable?  But &#34;what about the included cable management&#34; you ask?  How many times have you packed up for the night and didn't put everything away because youwere in a hurry or [insert any number of excuses here]. Sure, you can replace this cable, but it is one more expense and it would be a definite inconvenience.  Also, again there is the increased chance of damaging the male and female USB components at the stand connection point where there is normally only one (if that cable was internally connected as it is on my current, time tested, laptop cooler).<br /><br />Finally, perhaps most important (aside from the size issue because if it doesn't fit, what's the point?) is the effectiveness of the fans.  As I mentioned previously, I have a laptop that runs warm and sometimes downright hot.  If you have a laptop that runs warm-hot, I do not believe this will work for you.  I found the fan output to be very week when leaving my hand next to them.  That being said, it appeared to keep the surface of the stand (which I believe, if I remember correctly, was some sort of metal) a relatively neutral temperature.  So, it's not entirely ineffective, but I can say with certainty that it is not equipped to deal with a laptop that runs quite warm.  In case there are any naysayers who will try to make the argument that a laptop shouldn't run that warm/hot and that is a bigger issue, that's really neither here nor there.  Some laptops run like that and have since the day they were first powered up.  As I said, this cooler isn't ineffective, it's just not going to be effective enough for certain laptops.  Also, my GPU is located in the upper left corner of my laptop (under the Escape key essentially) and so I need more cooling in that area than anywhere else.  In fact, the rest of my laptop is almost always room temperature.  So, I was taking a leap of faith with this cooler stand, hoping that the decent fan coverage in the corners would be enough to do the job...Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Since the lighting that accompanies the fan operation is completely unnecessary, I would only make sense to cut out the fancy unnecessary blue lighting and use the extra power to amp up the fan output.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The AMNIE AE-CP1501 appears to be well built for its price.  If you have a laptop less than 16&#34; you should be fine with regards to product dimensions and for the average laptop (not build for serious graphics work or gaming) it will likely do a decent job cooling your machine.  In that case, I'd say that if you like the way this looks and the price is right, give it a shot.  If you have a 17&#34;+ laptop, I believe that you'll find it runs a bit short which makes managing both the laptop and the cooling stand a bit much and as it is an irregular shape (not a rectangle, but with several additional angles added in for show as opposed to increase air flow), it makes that even more cumbersome.  I ended up returning the product and ordering the newest version of the cooling stand I had purchased twice over the last 5 years [[ASIN:B00ED3WMTC Cooler Master NotePal U3 PLUS - Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with 3 Moveable High Performance Fans (Black)]]).  The only reason I purchased something else (the AMNIE cooler) was because I was looking for an alternative that did not come with a fixed incline, but I suppose I learned not to mess with what isn't broken as everything else on it perfectly for my needs and also came with an extended warranty."
3.0,"It lasted almost a year to the date. Naturally, it had to fail on the beginning of vacation. Lost a couple dozen photos that did not make it to the cloud when it failed."
3.0,"Works well, looks good, but oh my God is the price a ripoff."
3.0,There's not a hole at the bottom that allows me to leave the case on while charging it.  The keys get stuck to the leather and come off easily.  My tablet doesn't fit as snug as another case that I had.
3.0,"It works fine, but just a little disappointed that it doesn't stay in the open position without slipping into flat mode."
3.0,"The build quality is good, but the tracking is less than desirable. I also have the Razer destructor which has WAY better tracking. The goliathus causes my mouse to jump and skip around every now and again, which is supper annoying in any gaming situation; never had this problem with the destructor. But i like the size and it is more comfortable to have my wrist wrest on this than a sharp jagged edge like on the destructor."
3.0,The bottom pads have fallen off but it protects my computer wonderfully and it's a great color
3.0,"Works OK. The plug into the laptop is loose. It charges, but if you move the laptop, the plug wiggles and falls out. Made in China."
3.0,This modem can't be used for phone service. I wasn't aware of this until I got it.  Probably lack of research on my part.
3.0,It works. But you will find it is bulky if you are a traveler. I wish the made a thin model.
3.0,The Quality not that much
3.0,"I gave it three stars cause I'm really disappointed that I didn't get it in the right color. I would get a replacement but I don't want to have to spend more money for it to ship faster. Other than that it really is great, the tablet that I have fits perfectly in there. I can also fit in a binder,  (but not to easily) 3 composition note books, pencil bag,pro folio, & a couple of small things. Hope this review helped"
3.0,Is fine but a bit cheap made
3.0,"I've played with all of the display settings but finally gave up. The display resolution and colors are out of whack. I also really wish it had a backlit keyboard, but otherwise it's been as good as promised."
3.0,This cover does not provide a secure stand for the G4.  As you work with the tablet the stand will give way.  It does protect the tablet when being carried.
3.0,"Works fine.  Not a stand out product and not a bad product, but my email is much more difficult to open with this mouse than my former Mouse.<br />Otherwise, it is functional and serves purpose."
3.0,"I absolutely love this sleeve. It's almost like a denim material with daisy pattern on it. Strong Zipper. Nice and fuzzy on the inside. AND it fit my brand new mac with a case on it. Overall, its made very well and I am overly satisfied with this product. It shipped fast and got here in time for me to use it in class. (NOTE it does not come with a charger bag, but im sure you can fit in in your regular bag!) Would recommend!  Edit: never received the small case for the charger."
3.0,satisfied.
3.0,Worked great until it stopped..
3.0,I didn't know there was a larger size kindle Fire.  So this is too big for my kindle.  But the case is very nice.
3.0,OK for the price!
3.0,Arrived quickly but it doesn't fit my HP laptop .😦
3.0,Went bad in about a month
3.0,"Did not fit my dell M1330 without modifying the laptop.  The original battery has a notch cut into it in the center, but this battery does not.  I had to cut a tab off my laptop for this to fit.  Not a big deal considering the age of the laptop but many might not feel comfortable doing this."
3.0,Good enough for who its for.
3.0,it works but it isn't as impressive is i thought it would be
3.0,Works only with certain POUSB devices; induces too much resistance for most.
3.0,It worked..
3.0,I'ts ok for the money.
3.0,"This is my second Drobo; I got the 800FS a couple years ago.  Although I liked the idea of the 800FS, (reliable, foolproof, flexible) I found the speed (or lack of it) to be so bad it made the unit unusable.  I also did not like the fact I couldn't manage security properly. PROS: The 800i fixed all that.  It is much faster, and security is a breeze.  In fact in all the most important ways, it behaves like it was installed right in my computer. Having fixed all the technical issues, my only complaint is the price (but all these NAS drives are way overpriced). If you need a good reliable RAID like system, this is the solution for you.  Real plug and play once you know what you are doing and their techies will walk you through iSCSI with a smile. CONS: When the DROBO warranty runs out, you are screwed.  Extending it will cost an unsupportable $250 or so PER YEAR.  A lot of the inner workings are &#34;proprietary&#34; and the techs won't share that.  So you are on the hook for a whole lotta money or like me, you are thinking about selling this thing online.  If Drobo opened up their tech department or went open code, I would be their friend for life.  As it is, it's a great solution for a year, then it's a high end doorstop."
3.0,"Responds well to movements. Changeable DPI. Adjustable buttons with downloadable logitech drivers. (from [...])<br /><br />Only thing I don't like is how the thumb buttons are relatively close together. Also no \\""back/forward\\"" function with a left/right click of the middle mouse button (Don't know how else to describe that action. But instead of a press down on the scroll wheel, it tilts left and right.) Would've liked that but since I don't really adjust my DPI settings I just use the DPI buttons for back and forward.<br /><br />Bought this in July 2015 and now the middle mouse button stopped working. Seems to be happening to others (based on a quick google search) so I'm a bit disappointed and I can't get it replaced due to the length of time so I am going to just have to buy a different mouse I guess."
3.0,"Does the job.<br />Pretty loud fan though, you can get better for the same price elsewhere."
3.0,"Nice and bright lights, but no on/off switch. Easy to use... Plug in and go.Left front wheel kept falling off. Kept in place now by a small piece tape."
3.0,"I was excited by the prospect. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The instructions were less than clear, so I could not tell if the device was actually recording. I did get one recording from it, but since it is limited to 2 GB of output, about thirty minutes, it proved to be too difficult to be of real use.<br />The support staff was attentive, and really tried to help overcome the deficiencies, but, for me, it just didn't deliver as advertised.<br />Perhaps the use of their software would have mitigated the deficiencies, but it is only for PC, and not compatible with my Mac."
3.0,"Incompatible with one of my computers and an IBM servers (NAS), Got it to work with a coup[le other machines. I could have probably gotten it to work with the PC but the server wanted nothing to do with it. It would not boot up."
3.0,Does not seem to support higher speeds of my wifi router but works ok
3.0,It was to small for me.
3.0,"Although the interface is relatively simple to use and the book is very helpful, i can't seem to get a good resolution on the mac, so the faces are blurry, therefore making different facial expressions pointless. The annoying part is that the resolution only has a setting for windows as dictated in the instructions."
3.0,nice to have but it hangs which eventually wears on the cord.
3.0,While the drive is great the CyberLink that comes with it will not load onto my Windows 10 computer!
3.0,"This charger, while it works, upon receiving it it was clear it was not Apple. It is an aftermarket charger, made of slightly lesser quality components. Hey, I can't complain too much, because the price is great!"
3.0,good
3.0,"i would love to buy this keyboard, but unfortunately i just feel that it is way overpriced. Hard to tell how good the material quality is in the keyboard from the pictures but it looks nice. For the price, I'd hope that the quality matches. I just don't know that I would ever spend more than $100 on a keyboard."
3.0,"Decent wireless mouse, but the scroll &#34;surface&#34; is a bit annoying. It is a kind of track pad with haptic feedback (vibration), and it makes scrolling difficult. I would actually prefer a true scroll wheel. When reading thru documents I tend to use my laptop's trackpad instead, which somewhat takes away from the purpose of having a standalone mouse."
3.0,"First the good:<br />The board was shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. It functioned exactly as described.<br />Now, the not so good:<br />As noted by others, there is absolutely no documentation included. Not even a marking on the board to tell you how to attach wiring to the relays. You have to completely rely on the Internet to get any info at all. Even direct inquiries to the Sainsmart website are met with days of silence followed by cryptic requests for more information. Useless.<br />I'm sure it's a great board for light duty in robotics projects, as long as the relays are activated slowly.<br />I intended to use it in a virtual pinball project to control feedback devices. (Mostly solenoids). This board is not up to the task for this application. Rapid input such as fast activation of flippers or jet buttons cause the board to freak out and stop reacting to incoming signals. I stops activating the relays and the only way out is to exit and restart Visual Pinball. There are better solutions that are made specifically for Visual Pinball DOF."
3.0,Good value but the operating system is a little buggy. It periodically crashes and requires rebooting.
3.0,"Returned, it didn't fit the hard drive from my MacPowerbook. It was too thin."
3.0,Symbols on keyboard are mixed..The at sign is not where it should be at number 2...annoys me
3.0,Works but nothing like the pc version so glad to have it but not much....
3.0,"It's Pretty decent. It has all the functionality of a nice Windows laptop.  With such low configuration I would have expected to be little lighter. It comes with half the Memory left and if you update to windows 10, you will be very low on hardisk space because it will keep the windows.old file. So, make sure you delete the old installation of Windows after you upgrade to have any space at all. Other than that, pretty good for basic functionality."
3.0,only lasted for two months
3.0,"It is alright for a cheap tablet but it has alot of cons I will list the main pros first..  the size..the price.. the weight.. it downloads prime music.. speakers are okey..  it works as a reading tablet for my Kindle app.. for looking things up but not working on...  you can add to its memory...  now the cons.. glares.. hard to figure out versus  a kindle... does NOT download prime videos you can't watch them at all... screen scratches  easily..you have to look at it at a certain angle or it doesn't work..so if I would have the money  I would have bought a better tablet I really  like the kindle  fire hdx that my 3 year old has better. Than this but I needed a bigger screen so tried this would I get it again? Probably not  but it's not worth returning because it DOES work it is like comparing walmart things to name brand  if you need it and don't  have the money for a tablet I would get it, but if you can live without it for a month or two longer and save to spend more I definitely  would..."
3.0,"I ordered this case and when I received it, it didn't fit because it was for the iPad Air. I returned it and ordered another one. The same thing happened. So, I'm thinking that this description is wrong and it's only for the iPad Air."
3.0,Home button not easy to push on in case.
3.0,No shut off switch.
3.0,Please note that the 3G version only allows you to by books using 3G. You cannot browse the web using its 3G.
3.0,"This thing is mostly plastic with a few wires inside; at 33% of the cost of a new Nexus 7 2013 tablet, it is outlandishly overpriced."
3.0,Way smaller than expected
3.0,Works great- the cut is just a little too small for the screen and it's kind of a pain to reach the edge of the touchscreen but it was a great price and I love the look of it
3.0,The feet on my case fell off within a week after I purchased and began using it. I have had it for about 6 months in total and it is already cracked in multiple places and chunks of the case have fallen off and I am pretty gentle with my laptop. I have ordered a replacement from a different brand.
3.0,"Only two of the ports are &#34;powered&#34;, and so only these can be used to charge a phone or tablet. The other four ports are only handy when helpful when attached to a computer.  Mostly useful when used as a way of having multiple ports for a computer."
3.0,Pretty good. I've had it for a few months now. My only problem is that the red glow never turns off unless the mouse is unplugged or the power supply is off. Other than that I've had zero problems.
3.0,"This is a great deal but my biggest gripe is the proprietary connection. Special cable, special port. If either one breaks the drive is useless."
3.0,"This wireless bluetooth keyboard case holds the iPad snug and fits well. However, the attachment of the keyboard and case feels a bit flimsy, as does the stand. The keyboard itself works well though. In the end, I would prefer if the keyboard was actually separate from the case but snapped together for easy transport."
3.0,none
3.0,They break easily so if you are careful they will do what you want.
3.0,"As other people on here have mention, the separators in between some of the pockets started shredding a few months after I got this thing. It's great how much space and compartments it has for the price, but it doesn't hold up for very long. Also the little side mesh pockets are too small to fit water bottles into"
3.0,Destroyed to easily
3.0,The finish is too slick for me.
3.0,Nothing special. Just enough to hold the tablet!
3.0,this pad is great for everything besides gaming unless you enjoy hardpads there is no texture difference and  it glides too quickly for precise games like CS:GO but maybe for rpg's but it is very comfortable and has a nice aesthetic appeaal
3.0,"I had this folio case for 8 months of heavy use before the hinge failed. I replaced it with a Zagg key case with a different hinge that hopefully will last longer.  The battery lasted only a few days between charges not the several months advertised.  I generally liked the keyboard, which appears identical to the new one, a lot. The bluetooth connection would drop every few days requiring an ipad reboot.  In general, adding this keyboard to the ipad worked very well, greatly reducing the need to move over to a laptop for document creation."
3.0,"I bought this a few months ago. The top head cushion piece fell off after two weeks of use. Otherwise it's decent, but I should have spent a little more for something else."
3.0,"I don't like having to touch the screen so many times just to turn the page in the Home Device or Cloud settings.  If I could touch the screen just like I do when I'm reading a book would be wonderful.  Other than that I really like my new Kindle.  It has a lot of options that are going to take me a while to learn, but I'm looking forward to it."
3.0,broke after 2years
3.0,It does the job but I don't think it charges super fast...
3.0,"It's kind of slow, but not s bad mouse for its price:)"
3.0,"When the mouse is linked, it works very well. But it doesn't stay linked with the operating system consistently requiring me to unpair then reboot the computer to repair.  Even then, that sometimes does;t work for several tries."
3.0,nice cover--not sure why the clear one slips
3.0,"The buttons at touch pad are a kind of loose, and some of the the keys are too small, but it worked with a MacBook 13 mid 2010"
3.0,I ordered this to charge my kindle faster.  I have not seen it speed the charging process.  I am disappointed.
3.0,"I did not recieve a remote and aux cord that was supposed to come with the speakers.  It also looks like i received a used pair of speakers.  They still work, but i would have rated this 5 stars if i got the brand new one instead of used speakers."
3.0,"Pros: compact, dual battery, longer battery life, M2 slot for extra ssd, mini display port (apple compatible)<br />Cons: only 2 usb port, single ram slot, no disk activity led, no sleep button (for hibernation), awful touchpad<br /><br />I like my x220 but battery cannot last long. Today, x250 is no longer a notebook for heavy and serious business user. Don't try to imitate Apple product. People bought x-series in the past because something could not be easily done in Apple macbook air, like memory and hdd expansion."
3.0,ok
3.0,"I bought the correct size for my macbook and was ultra excited. However once I got it and put it on, the triforce just doesn't line up quite right to the apple. I was a bit disappointed, but at least it doesn't look that from across the room."
3.0,Product appears to be fine but it took almost a month for delivery..
3.0,"The cover was not all red. The corners were black. I didn't like the way it looked.  I returned this item, but kept the black version. It does allow it to stand on the landscape side, but not the portrait side. I've had for about one month. It feels a little flimsy now. Still works."
3.0,"It's  a cheaply made, rubbery-type of material that wasn't what we expected, but glad that we got it for a great deal.  It does the job to protect your iPad from children drops and slips.  Keep in mind it does not have a screen protector.  The case is thick and we haven't had any issues with it not standing up like you see in the photo.  I would buy it again."
3.0,thought I was buying a thunderbolt to RJ45 - can't use this.  Not the fault of the manufacturer but it was in the listing results of my search
3.0,After putting jusy a few items on the unit. AI went to upgrade to Windows 10 and did not have enough space to upload Windows 10. Nice small PC but just not enough storage space. Comes with 32gb but that is before the OS ad all the bloatware. Only about half that is available for use.
3.0,"absolutely awesome. alienware quality and macbook size&weight. run gta5 and dota2 and leagues really well. battery is good. only problem is with windows8.1' not with the laptop.'diagnosing your pc' UPDATED 8/9: SCREW IT'SOMETHING IS BROKEN INSIDE AND I HAVE TO SEND IT TO DELL'THE QUALITY CONTROL IS TERRIBLE UPDATED 24/9: IT WAS STILL UNDER DELL'S REPAIR ! I AM REALLY MAD NOW UPDATED 30/9：Back to me again, 6 different parts including hard drive, keyboard and motherboard have been replaced by Dell in Houston( btw I am in VA) The whole charge for the process is zero."
3.0,"Doesn't  fit  as snugly  as an otterbox, but still  is great for the price."
3.0,"I have mixed feeling about this case. I like the color and the material. The magnetic lock/unlock works as expected.<br /><br />However the ridge/hinge is significant. Maybe that's unavoidable. It's not the end of the world.<br /><br />There are two bigger problems. First, the opening for the power/dock connector is a little small and none of the cables I have fit well. A little work with a rat-tail file will address that. Second, the case rests too closely on the power switch which means that holding the case wrong can easily cause the power button to be activated, turning the iPad off at inopportune times.<br /><br />Again I think this is fixable using the file/rasp but I also think both of these issues could have been addressed in the product design or represent poor construction."
3.0,It's cheap feeling but most certainly get the job done.  Some keys like to stick though not often but it does happen
3.0,This mouse worked great for the about 4 months. After 4 months of using it for about 30 hours a week the scroll wheel stopped working.
3.0,"Needed a tablet to read PDFs in school and I can say that it got the job done.<br />Pros:<br />Can run apps like Clash of Clans and Twitch nicely. (Twitch is probably a bit more demanding than CoC)<br />Can be rooted.<br />Cons:<br />Not sure if its only me or also other cases, but the calibration on my tablet is off resulting in alot of annoying misclicks.<br />Although I say that it can run apps such as stated above, you can't really enjoy them for long periods of time due to the short life span of the battery. It dies really fast, even with only one app running in the background.<br />It can cause issues for certain games (School Idol Festival) because the tablet suffers the &#34;rooted, but not rooted&#34; issue. So you have to go through quite a deal to get this tablet to run apps that block rooted tablets/phones.<br />REALLY small storage, if you plan on buying this tablet you'd have to buy yourself a decent sized micro SD to compensate for the small amt of space this tablet has.<br /><br />I don't think these belong in the Cons or Pros, but the speakers and camera are both below average. Although it may be a con, this is a cheap tablet so I can't really see how you'd expect high quality audio or pictures. However using earphones the audio is fine."
3.0,"I love the case, but the stand doesn't work all of the time and so it just collapses. The case keeps my iPad safe though and I love the pattern."
3.0,Chinese fake
3.0,"I own an ASUS ROG 17&#34; G73JHA1 gaming laptop I bought in 2010. It had came with an ASUS laptop book bag, but that got stolen. My laptop is PRETTY BIG, and I expected this to hold the laptop and conceal it perfectly. However, this laptop bag does not fully conceal my laptop, as the top protrudes from the zipper line, and I can not close the zipper. I can not even fit my charger and mouse WITH the laptop. Terrible buy. It is a paperweight essentially. My Herschel book bag can carry my laptop, charger and mouse, while this cant. STEER CLEAR"
3.0,"Didn't fit into my GT 520 after its fan broke. Decided to test it out either way elsewhere, its a neat fan but it also suffered the fate of my GT 520's fan, the blades are really fragile making screwing it down a pain if not done carefully."
3.0,"Have had one in use for about 3 years and it croaked.  5v power adapter went belly up, produces 0v now.  Unfortunately powering it with another 5v adapter doesn't bring it back. The power LED lights up but none of the ports do.  Something inside is making a high-pitched periodic whine, I'd guess a bad capacitor.  Debating whether it's worth it to try replacing the caps."
3.0,"Fairly good quality product, but very difficult to apply with no fault, ...the smallest piece of dust will create air bubbles that will be there to stay. At least glad there are 3 screens in the pack, I managed to get the third one about right.<br />The sheet is not immune to finger printed either, which is a bit disappointing."
3.0,"The top shell doesn't fit my Macbook Air properly. The bottom shell has no problems at all, but the top one falls off all of the time and won't stay on. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"These decals were tricky to line up, and even when lined up correctly, there is no way to truly get the edges secured. The edge of the decal on the top of my computer are always slightly lifted. It functions well for its purpose of protecting the white computer from dirt and scratches, but I do wish that it were a bit better fitted to stay secure on the computer."
3.0,"I purchased this product on February 6. Looking at reviews, I am one of the lucky ones, I guess, seeing as it lasted nearly 6 months. However, the logo didn't strike me as a knockoff, but I am no expert. Your money will apparently go further with an Apple purchase. I am unable to comment on the return policy at this time, but if something is amiss there, I will update the comment."
3.0,The side of my headphone broken randomly and the thing is I did even press on it that hard. I was just picking them up to put on then out of no where crack. The side was broken. Has everything you want but breaks easily.
3.0,"At first it was crashing my PC non stop before and after installing the drivers, but for some reason out of the blue it started to work and has been working since. Its a good card and haven't been disappointed in regards to connecting to the internet."
3.0,"Disappointed that it doesn't stream videos smoothly: reboots often. Otherwise a good little tablet for the money. Also, doesn't fit any of the cases recommended by Amazon, so don't bother ordering them unless you want to do some modifications."
3.0,"It works to support your wrist but it has a terrible chemical smell.  That smell transfers to your hand and wrist although the transferred smell does dissipate after a few minutes from your skin.  I've had my pad exposed to air for over 2 days and the smell still lingers.  Also, the oval shaped gel portion has flattened a little after just 1 day of use but it still firmly supports my wrist.  The pad definitely stays in place.  The dark blue color looks nice.  But, if you're going to buy a smelly mouse pad you might as well buy a cheaper pad.  I won't return my pad because of the smell but I know better now."
3.0,"Everything did not download I.e. photos, games, Facebook,, iTunes.  A lot of password s disappeared.  I.  Would not do this again.  I am a senior and not very good with this stuff.  I need easy and automatic.."
3.0,it became very blurry after a while
3.0,"I've had this cover for about a week now. It came in nice packaging that I was actually pretty impressed with. It's thinner silicone than I thought it would be, and this wouldn't be a problem if the cover hadn't arrived a little warped. one corner was folded over, so it sticks up now, and the space bar cover doesn't lay flat against the key. it bubbles up in the center. I hope this will correct itself over time.  Other than that, the cover doesn't move around as I type,(except on the space bar and surrounding bottom keys) and it keeps the crumbs, dust, hair and other gunk out of my keyboard.(because we all know that crap never truly gets clean). It takes some practice to type on it without messing up, but its a good product. I'll probably end up buying it in other colors too. I'll update this to tell if the other ones arrive misshapen."
3.0,its kind of slow and the screen will all of the sudden get real big or shrink real small so I have to adjust it again. Its alright but I have some problems with it. For the price I guess I cant complain to much.
3.0,"I'm using this with an Asus N550JX Laptop and as others have commented it doesn't wake the screen after sleeping.  Usually unplugging it and plugging it back in works, sometimes I have to power cycle the monitor.  I'll be looking for a replacement, just wanted for others to be aware of this issue."
3.0,"Meets the standards but nothing impressive, the price was nice but it added extra 20 dollars if you want to buy it from Canada, also make very loud noises when starting system with it."
3.0,"Nice design, Not very rugged, Plastic seems brittle. Placed one on a small dog cage, put fan on high and it's doing the job but if it was on a big dog cage you would need at least two.<br /><br />I was surprised at two things, a power supply was not included and given modern technology in small electric motors and batteries that the motor was as weak as it is. These days there are motors and batteries that can make a small dog cage fly but the company couldn't do better than a 1970's design platform?"
3.0,It's flimsy...hopefully that still protects it
3.0,"This isn't the greatest product in the world, but it works. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the Bluetooth connection going on my iPod Classic, but it does indeed work.<br /><br />Besides the occasionally fiddly connection problem, my only complaint is that if you're listening to your iPod via this thing, you cannot adjust the volume on the iPod - you have to do it on whatever the Bluetooth is interfacing with, like the wireless speaker...which can be a problem if you have a certain kind of speaker that only gets so loud.<br /><br />Beware: this thing is VERY EASY TO LOSE!<br /><br />But hey, for the purchase price, this is a pretty good deal."
3.0,"I got this to work with an Android player called Cubox. I have complaints about it. If you about to right click, it is cumbersome. If you want to scroll up and down, it is not so good. The keypad is a nice idea, but when you hit the keys, some of them double-type, so you always have to backspace over what you just typed. If you want to use the keyboard, you naturally want to hold it with both hands and that covers up the IR. Basically, it doesn't work that well. It is a nice small remote that works for everything else. It is very small. Some people may think that is a good thing, but I personally think it is a little too small. It does feel like a quality remote."
3.0,"Wish the ribbon cable was longer.  Wish the focal point was closer.  I was trying to get it to view my 3d printout as it was happening, however, it needs to be further away, in which case, no detail is shown."
3.0,"Does its job. But it is not sensitive enough, always have a bit delay. Also, when make a click the cursor sometime jumps to another position.<br />I always love logitech 's products, and I feel disappointed this time."
3.0,"Frankly, I've got mixed feelings about this cover. Yes, it's made of quality materials, it protests the device very well, it activates the device when you open it, but it's pretty heavy. Voyage is the lightest Kindle, but with this cover it weights 310 g which is considerably more than my previous Kindle (4) with a much lighter cover (Kindle 4+Belkin cover=240g). So before you buy this cover, think about whether you more often read holding Kindle in your hand or whether you prefer placing it on the table before you. This case is not great for the former."
3.0,"Ordering my 2nd one. My original took a hit for the team and absorbed nearly all the damage from dropping the MBP retina. It landed on a corner. The KUZY bottom case cracked but keep the MPB from getting seriously dented.<br /><br />Yes, I'm getting another!<br /><br />The only downside of the case is that its little rubber feet tend to fall off over time. They are so small, you don't realize until you notice that the case seems wobbly on a flat surface."
3.0,Love the case till one of the bands broke after 7 months of gently use.
3.0,"I have had many different tablets including kindles.  My main issue is the fact that 1/2 of the storage space cannot be used by the child.  So my son is constantly having to delete games to install other games.  He doesn't even have that many installed.  His tablet allows him 4 gb to use.  When he gets close to that, it will turn off his internet.  We won't be able to get it turned back on until we delete something. There are a lot of pre installed items that we have no interest in, but cannot take them out.  It is easy for the child to use (but it is a pain in the neck when I am constantly having to switch accounts to add items to his account).<br /><br />I wish I would have saved the money and just bought another regular kindle, with the child protected case.  The kindle does withstand a lot of abuse and I am happy about that.  My 4 year old is not gentle.  But with the limited space (and no way to expand it) it just isn't very fun for him."
3.0,"Bought this on HSN and put it in the computer but 12+ hrs later still not finished so I had to stop it.  Next time I tried again and this time it took 4+ hrs and still not done so I stopped it.  This shouldn't take this long.  Update -  Contacted customer service via email and they suggested I do a factory reset which I did.  Put it back in and it took 5 hours to complete.  And it found some viruses.  I also spoke with them and they said it can take longer for older computers.  Mine is running vista.  Still 5 hours is way too long.  Strange that when I first ran it, it had to do an update so I don't get why a factory reset wasn't part of it.  Changed my stars from 1 to 3."
3.0,The arrow keys are non standard and the keyboard feels unsubstantial
3.0,Love the concept. Customer service great. Design variation of one pictured and colors much lighter and pastel-y than picture displays.
3.0,Screen does not stay up in the horizontal position
3.0,I hate the windows but the laptop does what i need it to do
3.0,This drive was supposed to come with 200 GB of OneDrive space. when trying to register this drive on-line it did not recognize the serial number so I could not register the product to receive the cloud space. After writing to Seagate why it woud not recongize the serial # they requested an invoice and pictures from the drive and the box. It seems that the registration department had no idea about this drive. Finally after a few days a nd telling them I would send the drive back I could register it. But all together it was a hassle to get this going.
3.0,good but a bit loose
3.0,"As soon as I got these I was pretty disappointed, the build quality seems pretty poor, they are very flimsy and seem like they would break after a decent amount of force had Bebe applied to them. When I got them the mute button for the mic was missing but I couldn't be bothered posting them back to America just to get a mic mute button. The sponge on the actual ear pieces is very tough and uncomfortable at first but after a few days or a week of use they will soon soften up and become pretty comfortable. Overall these headphones are top tier but if you're looking for a temporary pair of headphones whilst you save up for a top tier pair then these will do fine as they are easy to set up and use."
3.0,"Actually the item probably worked better than I'm giving it credit for, but, not being a Bluetooth guy, the instructions could use a little work.  Once I got it up and running, everything was great.  I have a keyboard for my Kindle and I still use the screen as my mouse."
3.0,Ok
3.0,"Cool backpack, but it started ripping wide open at the seams at the top less than two months in.<br /><br />Great concept and look, poor execution it appears. Hope the next version will be better!"
3.0,"When my girlfriend saw this bag, she commented, &#34;Ok, that one is cute!&#34; While this alone wouldn't detract me from liking it, it really is very small. Once my 13&#34; Macbook Pro is placed in this bag, there's maybe room for another notebook or small textbook.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's ok. You should recognize you're getting only $50 or so of leather bag...which is not a lot of leather bag. The hardware, leather, etc is all noticeably cheap, and it's very easy to spot the cut corners. The leather is quite stiff for how thin it is, possibly because of the lining. The look of the bag isn't too bad, though, so if you're looking for a cheap, decent looking bag that won't last too long or carry much at all, this may be worth it to you.<br /><br />Part of me thinks this deserves 4 stars for a product that roughly meets expectation for the price point, but I do want to emphasize that this isn't a high-quality product. Amazon does identify 3 stars as &#34;It's okay,&#34; so we'll go with it.<br /><br />2.13.16 Update: I just noticed this is the  most &#34;unhelpful&#34; voted review I've ever written. I checked, and sure enough, at time of writing, every single negative review on this bag older than a month has 19-20 unhelpful votes. Perhaps &#34;RusticTown&#34; (the seller) is about 20 employees strong? If you are reading this and sincerely feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to leave a comment with some feedback."
3.0,The color started wearing off after one month of use.
3.0,Much cheaper (flimsy) item than I expected.
3.0,"Monitor works fine.  It should not have been labeled as a HDMI monitor. It is actually a DVI monitor,"
3.0,The top left seam broke the first time I slid in my tablet. But I was able to fix it easily and completely using Loc-Tite superglue. Am very pleased with the Bluetooth keyboard and overall product value.
3.0,"nice, but doesn't stay on good."
3.0,It's ok
3.0,"Have been using it for a year now and its still in good condition, nothing (that I'm aware of) has torn and neither have the zippers gotten stuck or have broken. Even with a couple of notebooks and the 15.6 laptop, the straps help ease the load, but you will start to feel it weighing you down and hurting your shoulders after a while.  EDIT 12/29/2016: I bought this bag in November 15, 2014, and is now tearing at the straps. What I carried is still the same as above. Not sure if a life expectancy of 2 years for a backpack like this is normal, but I'm going to bring this from a 4 star to a 3 star."
3.0,Easy to fit.
3.0,I'm so sorry that my review doesn't meet your expectation. I'm having personal problems right now and can not try this product out. My laptop was stolen..... I don't have INTERNET set up. I don't have a home computer right now . That's in storage. I'm sure it's good. I have not bought anything that was in poor condition as of today.
3.0,does not stand well
3.0,"Fabric started stripping within 1 month of playing as it rubs against the table. Quality, its alright I guess. Sad to see that strip of wire gone."
3.0,"This kindle has a lot of nice features like dual cameras, but I am not at all impressed with the speakers. I hooked up the kindle to an auxiliary speaker to listen in the car and could barely hear the audio book. Couldn't turn up the volume any higher. I also had a terrible experience with support and was told there was NOTHING they could do for me and that I would have to purchase a new kindle (this one) and did not have any discounts.Left a bad taste, especially since I have purchased 4 previous kindles for family members."
3.0,"Received late in April , 2015 and has already begun to fail ? Has gone out and in since early August ."
3.0,ok
3.0,Can't personalize or connect with google.
3.0,3 stars for the keyboard. zero stars for the case. The case offers no support.
3.0,Good unit but too slow
3.0,Still an issue with reflection when<br /> Outside.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Some of these were dinged and one did not work, for whatever reason, but they were cheap!  And shorties, too."
3.0,cannot connect to Internet when it is plugged
3.0,"If I had ordered this in time to use from the 1st day I received my Dell XPS13, I might have been more willing to put up with the loose fit and less responsive feel. I have not used one of these before, but had hopes maybe I could keep the keys more pristine. Since they were already showing signs of being shiny from use, I am not using the protector now. If I were in a place where spills were a concern, it could be a help."
3.0,"Works as a keyboard. Nothing fancy, no problems, but also not exceedingly nice as far as build quality is concerned.<br /><br />Works if you need a backup. Would not recommend as primary keyboard."
3.0,It works but the pic isn't great. But...you can watch movies on you phone and project them on your t.v. that's cool.
3.0,"I purchased the straight (non-angled) short (6&#34;) cable which is probably better than the angled cables since it does not have a 90° soldered connector which is more stressful on the very thin internal wire which may cause this cable to break and fail more easily.<br /><br />Anyway, this cable is working as intended to charge devices and even use as a data transfer cable. My problem is this cable is really slow to allow charging current to my devices, taking a long time to complete a charge.<br /><br />Otherwise, this cable appears well made with solid (firm) connector ends. Okay to use for long-term, undisturbed charging."
3.0,I ordered 2 and 1 was defective. Not happy!
3.0,"Everything worked fine (magnetic closure, triangular fold, fit, etc), except it only lasted a few months before cracking. The reason this happened is that the right side is almost entirely exposed, instead of just cutting out holes for the power button and audio jack. There is only a tiny, fragile piece of case on the corner that broke off and couldn't be fixed with superglue. Also, since the right side is unprotected, I always have to watch out when slipping my iPad into my bag, making sure that side is not facing the bottom and potentially getting damaged when setting my bag on the floor."
3.0,Did not work for a long time however customer service refunded me even after 30 days
3.0,Amazing tablet. I can watch a full HD movie and download what I want. I  want to buy 3 of this product and give to my family.
3.0,not enough wind power
3.0,"Excellent layout, very convenient and professional looking. It has places for everything  I need to carry as an executive consultant.<br /><br />EXCEPT for two defects:<br />1. the zippers are very fragile and break easily<br />2. the stitching on both straps pulled out. (I didn't overload it, except the 17&#34; laptop it's supposed to carry)<br /><br />If someone made a version of this laptop with proper workmanship, I'd love. this one barely lasted a 18 months."
3.0,Good thank
3.0,it is to touchy.
3.0,"No HDMI port, if I would have noticed, would hade other choice"
3.0,ok
3.0,"First and foremost THIS IS NOT LEATHER!!!!! I don't care if you call it PU &#34;leather&#34; it's NOT LEATHER.  Nor does it stand up like leather.  That being said, it works good, the sleep function works well, wakes up easily too.  I have abused mine by stuffing it in my back pocket and the front & back cover show little to no wear.  However, it's not leather and it's not durable and I love folding my cover back on itself to read one handed and after only having it a few months the spine is about to give up the ghost.  For less than $20 I guess it's ok, but I'd rather shell out the extra money for REAL LEATHER and know it will last longer."
3.0,"Battery works great. Size very slightly different. Seems to fit fine but cannot slide the lock lever into place. Old batt locks fine and could not spot any difference, but this batt will not lock. This is the only reason for this 3 star rating."
3.0,"I bought this for my wife to use in her Nikon D800 (she's a professional family and wedding photographer). The memory card can store a ton of photos however my wife admitted it's not as fast as the other cards she uses, primarily SanDisk Extreme. Maybe this is due to the larger capacity of this card, I assumed the PNY card would be faster due to the advertised speed, but there is a pretty noticeable difference in performance between this PNY card and her 64GB SanDisk Extreme. Outside of this the card offers a ton of capacity which my wife needed for wedding shoots. She recommends this car for anyone needing a lot of storage space and an affordable priced card, just be aware that the advertised speed may not be 100% true."
3.0,"It lasted for almost 5 years with almost no issues, now it crapped out.  It still works if you plug into the Ethernet port, but the wifi doesn't work.  It lets you connect, but there's no data being sent/received.<br />The wifi signal was never super far, if it was across a house and on a different floor you couldn't connect, but I think it was standard for the wireless N routers at the time.<br />While it was working, I did have to reset it every 6 months or so.  Not very often."
3.0,"It works great, but it is top heavy. If you put more than one cable, you have to be careful when grabbing them because the charger welk fall off."
3.0,"I bought this Tablet 2 years ago and seeing as it's finally given up on me I decided to write a review.<br /><br />It was much cheaper when I bought it ($69) but I still feel as though the newer higher price is still fair. It's a great tablet that's easy to transport and works incredibly well.<br /><br />However, I encountered a lot of trouble with the USB port in the last couple months of use. First off- the port around the MiniUSB port is very small. I haven't found a good nonWacom Brand cable to replace it. (The Wacom brand cable is $22, a lot more than I'm willing to pay for a USB cable.)<br />When googling to find an alternative, I learned this tablet is known for having an easily broken USB port. This is apparently easily fixed via soldering but I don't have access to those kinds of materials.<br /><br />Also, I found the drivers would occasionally switch off while drawing but this is a fairly easy (if not annoying) fix."
3.0,"One of the &#34;rubber&#34; feet fell off, they are just stickers. Also, when I open the laptop the case sometimes &#34;clicks&#34; off a bit. Otherwise, it serves its purpose."
3.0,NO COMMRNT
3.0,"It's a great case! However, it has a magnet for the closure. You cannot put credit cards in their because the magnet will erase the information on the card."
3.0,It only lasted a week. It seems that USB 3.0 drives have a reliability issue...
3.0,"October 11, 2015<br />I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 because the cable, right where the end plug is, has lost connection. They are less than two months old. I can move the wire around to make it work but it is intermittent. This may be due to my son's habit of playing with the cord, wrapping around his fingers, etc. Or it may be due to poor design or quality. I'm not sure. If it failed because my son was playing with the cord then perhaps these won't work with us. We are headed on vacation in three weeks so I just ordered another pair of headphones.<br /><br />Remembering that our son used the Kidz Gear headset for years before they broke I'm switching back to Kidz Gear. When the Kidz Gear (two pair) broke it was the volume control in the cord that went bad. The new Kidz Gear headphones no longer have a volume control in the cord. I just ordered another Kidz Gear headset. (I later found out Kidz Gear still has a volume control, they just redesigned it.)<br /><br />Original Review<br />Good headphones for the price. The best thing I can say about these is my five-year-old likes them. They sound good, fit good, and I'm hoping the no tangle cord lives up to it's name.<br /><br />We had purchased two of the Kidz Gear headphones. The first pair lasted about two years, and the second about 18 months. That is pretty good service for a headset that is used often by a child, but... Both Kidz Gear headsets had to be tossed out due to the volume control in the cord which ceased to work. From what I can see Kidz Gear seems to have eliminated the volume control from their latest offering so they must have had too many complaints. However these Sentey were quite a bit less expensive so I thought we'd give them a try."
3.0,The suede on the bottom breaks really fast - 6 months. The reason I didn't give it one star is that Jan Sport replaced it. We lined the new one with duct tape so it doesn't happen again.
3.0,"I just received this product and I was delighted. Although my Kindle Fire HD 7 fits in this case it doesn't seem as if this keyboard is compatible. But I do still think that this case is of good quality. I will try to get a refund and by looking at the other reviews, It seems as if the customer service of this product is reliable."
3.0,works fine but there is no UL sticker so I hope there is no fire here.
3.0,"It is super nice looking but too light to carry a Laptop, could be a little sturdier.  Must get a strong laptop sleeve with it."
3.0,"Great item, but there was not an invoice ir any other proof of purchase with the product. For me, it is crucial in the case of any problem."
3.0,Good but locks up too often.
3.0,ok
3.0,"It works ok, but for a cost to performance ratio I don't know if it was worth it. They increase on our back deck is negligible. I added this antenna as well as the version without the base so I was hoping for a bit more from the two of them."
3.0,Great!
3.0,"Lenovo Product Management MUST resolve Very Pesky issues that destroy the Experience of using this otherwise great laptop: (1) Disable the goddam Automatic Gesture Recognition feature. There are so many Non-Standard Gestures, that ONLY after you loose data or see weird behavior that you realize that the fricking OS is doing something on its own in the background. Very Frustrating. The system messes up my word processing Everyday. Again, Everyday the mouse jumps around because the Laptop is doing something weird in background and Mis-interprets your commands. Horrible. (2) Sit the frick down and hire some good english-speaking designers to write a Better Manual and Instructions to use the Gesture Recognition. Make sure Instructions are Organized, well-composed, logical and clear."
3.0,"I had Anywhere mouse 1 for the last few years, as a general purpose netsurf, occasional 3D app use. Worked fine mostly inspite of the well-known flaws of double right click issue. Main attraction for me is wireless, works with unifying stick, has some extra buttons, side tilt, and relatively small size and flatness. But the weight with 2 AA batteries remain a wrist breaker for me. So I was super excited by the new Anywhere mouse 2 with no more battery. Imagine my shock when I found out - not only you need to install a new software (Logitech &#34;Options&#34;)that doesn't do anything the existing SetPoint doesn't do, you are allowed only ONE custom profile settings.  Logitech &#34;Options&#34;, with one option. Wow, seriously. Sadistic.  I thought, this can't be true, searched the net, there's a long thread on Logitech's own forum full of angry former Anywhere mouse owners, who feel misled, cheated, at least UNDER-informed. Whether this is yet another typical Logitech sales tactic (sell you a 70% okay 30% frustration product so you will buy another one soon hoping to solve your dilemma), or idiotic oversight, it is immaterial now. I've spent $100 on yet another piece of Logitech waste-ware. I can't return it because I found out more than a week later.  If like me you are seeking a light weight small form factor mouse with at least 5 programmable buttons, horizontal tilt, AND unique profile per application, don't get this. Until Logitech fix this issue. Or check out Microsoft Comfort mouse or Razer Orochi with similar feel and usage.  (UPDATED JANUARY 2016) Less than a month after this complaint Logitech has finally updated their software Logitech Options to include Per Application Profile functionality. Their existing Logitech SetPoint continues to act stupid and conflict with Logitech Options. But for now Anywhere 2 is usable again. Unfortunate for me, I spent another $80 on a corded multi-button gaming mouse since. From 1 star I added 2 more stars."
3.0,Not as good as the older generation. It could be that it ships with the soft tip instead of the firm that was shipped on the first generation.
3.0,I ordered this for my 6th grader son to use as a school bag because he loves the game. The bag looked ok but it was way to big.
3.0,Ok
3.0,"Shipping was quick and the follow up by the company was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the problem with my laptop still exists.<br />Apparently, it is my computer and not the part.  I actually would buy it again if I needed a battery."
3.0,"The keyboard is too sensitive,  the cursor always moves without tapping. No more defects.<br />The laptop has generally outstanding performance. Touch screen is perfect."
3.0,"its a decent headset, my only issues is that certain programs that are outputting audio are not being handled correctly by the provided soundcard. for example. i play a game called league of legends, and whatever sounds it doesnt know what to do with, it will just send them to the right ear only. this goes as well for games like saints for 4, lucius, path of exile, etc. umm, as far as sound quality goes, it takes a while to tweak around with the EQ, but once you get your preference, it doesnt sound as s***ty out of the box.    tip: do not have your surround sound enabled for music rhythm games such as osu!. it will lower volumes at random points, you will have to disable surround sound.    but boy, this headset sure is comfortable, sometimes i forget im even wearing it. the earcups dont even touch my ear. just around them.    cable is perfect length. thing about the inline cable controls is that the mute switch is kinda hard to push up or down.    the software was easy to install.    id give this headset a 9/11"
3.0,"For me, this card is unstable. It only became useable for me once I reduced the voltage and the clockspeed. That's dumb. A top-of-the-line (at the time) card should be stable."
3.0,ok
3.0,"This is a good little tablet...don't get me wrong. I love my fire phone but Fire HD 6 is a little less stable than my Fire phone. I got this for my wife as I thought she would like the way it works. But, it freezes up quite a bit. She needs to restart it about twice a day. Too many problems for what I expected based on my experience with the phone."
3.0,"disappointing, purchased brand new and when received the back space button would not work. I had to send it back. not yet sure on turn around time."
3.0,The hardware supports the WLC2504 in a standard 19&#34; rack. But the cost from Cisco is crazy high for what you get.
3.0,"If you have an 8&#34; tablet and are looking for a keyboard and case, this is a great combo. The keyboard stays charged for a long time and is easly removed. It's held on by magnets and hasn't fallen out on me but I can easily remove it when I need to.<br />One of the clips that hold the tablet in place did break on me but that is because I remove the tablet a lot and it eventually wore out."
3.0,Keyboard a little slow.
3.0,It looks very nice and sturdy but it not fit my ipad 3 need to return
3.0,I've had this for six months...the screen seems to be getting a bit of a short....otherwise great! Great battery life...great backup to my Mac...UPDATE I'm on a year and the screen has pretty much shorted out...I could open the lid about 30 degrees otherwise the backlight would turn off. Not sure what's up...
3.0,2 products have changed two was problematic.
3.0,"Not really efficient to cool off the pc (-1 to -5°C max), pretty quiet but could not be considered as silent.<br />And this coolpad is definetly thick. So if you want to use your laptop keyboard with your pc on it, you better crank it down to the lowest level, and even there it get some times to get your wrists used to it."
3.0,I received this as a gift and use it weekly. I use several on-line libraries for content. Books from the library MUST go through Amazon. (weird) I am frustrated with the device and its requirement to link to the internet. Several word games require contact with the internet. This is not widely established as a policy/requirement from Amazon. I download all my content via USB. This degrades the usefulness of the device. I would recommend a different device because of this design or operational requirement. Perhaps Amazon will modify this in the future.
3.0,"..just ok for facebooking,,,other than that this product is not good for productive use..."
3.0,"The blue plastic pieces were very thin, not durable."
3.0,"Worked very well with my ASUS transformer but it are still slight glitches in the touch.  So, just three stars"
3.0,Good but not great for gaming.
3.0,Good
3.0,It's a fine keyboard and mouse but the keyboard turns off every time the computer goes to sleep or turns off and you have to turn it back on again however the mouse light is always on. It took me a while to figure out as well that you have to press scr lk to turn on the keyboard light
3.0,"Works well but the clamp was very cheap and literally fell apart with no way to reattach it. I now jerry-rig it to where I need it to be but a working clamp would be much easier! Otherwise, it stays in the position you bend it to and holds the device well!"
3.0,Nice protective case but a little bulky makes my tablet quite heavy!
3.0,"On first use of the charge adapter it would spark when plugging into the AC outlet. I tried several outlets. Very concerning, and I discontinued use immediately.<br />After notifying the seller they shipped me a new adapter the same day. It worked fine. It was unfortunate that the first adapter didn't work, and that I needed to wait for another, but I really appreciate that the seller addressed the issue immediately and shipped the replacement product same day. It's been some time since the purchase, but I'm pretty certain that they upgraded the shipping for me as well.<br />The seller made the best out of a bad situation.<br />I will buy from this seller again."
3.0,the right and left clicks sometimes not working properly when i play dota 2.
3.0,"didn't fit my setup, if i ever get the right setup i will give more or less stars"
3.0,I must say I was shocked at how fast I was able to unlock a lock easy to use and cheap it's a very simple tool
3.0,perfect fit!
3.0,good
3.0,"The mouse works well like a mouse should. My only complaint was that when the product arrived, one of the clickers was lifted and I had to fix it in order for it to work. Otherwise it does the job!"
3.0,"Not what i wanted or expected from RAZER, felt like cheap plastic....price tooo high!!"
3.0,"Only gave it a three because honestly I have not had time to use it. I will next week and rate again, however I love my Kindle 7. If it's anything like that one it's great."
3.0,"The case itself:<br />Luvvitt brand cases tend to get discolored over time. I'm not sure due to what but I have a friend that has a case for her phone that's Luvvitt brand and it has turned a brownish/yellowish dark color that does not look very clear at all over time. That's something I was willing to live with however because I know from experience that the protection itself is great and sturdy. Also I don't think I will be taking my iPad around places &#34;naked&#34; with a complete front-covering case.<br /><br />With an all-around protection case on it + Luvvitt case:<br />I really just needed protection for my iPad since I already have a case with a built-in bluetooth keyboard (Belkin). This case + iPad Air still fit in my keyboard case, but I feel like over time the case is going to get worn out from me removing my iPad from time to time. It does work for now though.<br /><br />With a screen protector on + Luvvitt case:<br />You pretty much have to forego having a screen protector if you are getting this case. You can also cut the top off your screen protector, but who wants to create more bubbles and have a tacky cut on the screen protector? Because the case wraps around the edges a little too snugly, the case tends to push your screen protector out or lift it up which made me SO ANNOYED. I mean who doesn't have a screen protector on their touch-screen electronics these days? That's like leaving the house without shoes on."
3.0,"First one I got worked well for a couple weeks, then completely stopped connecting to any device. Anker was good about sending me a replacement, and that one worked pretty well."
3.0,"handle started cracking and shell face shows a pink color when scratched. Not too go a quality, IMHO"
3.0,The kindle HDX 8.9 is an amazing tablet . I gave the tablet a 3 out of 5 stars because I wish it had more apps to choice from in their app store and also I would of loved it more if I was able to personalize it with my own background pictures instead of amazon automatically placing their own background photos.
3.0,Reasonably fast tablet. Easy to use.
3.0,"This graphics card is amazing for gaming. I've yet to have a better one, however, its fans are extremely noisy."
3.0,Thanks
3.0,"good product, worth the money spent. Thanks"
3.0,works as good as the rest.
3.0,"It has been about five months since I installed this power supply on my computer, so far so good.    Update:  It died after one year."
3.0,Fired up just fine simple enough and throughput for wireless and hardwired products is great. However I am very surprised at the archaic interface just barely a GUI at all. And lack of information about connected devices or network monitor is nonexistent. The access control module seems backwards to me. Just my opinion maybe more experience with the product will provide better review.
3.0,Great reader. I went from the old push button kindle to this one and it's a dream. Love the light and font features.
3.0,"Okay, I paired this up with my [[ASIN:B00JXLGE70 Dell XPS XPSU12-8000CRBFB 12.5-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Laptop]] and yes it did work... if the objective is to simply extend the battery time with an extra charge.  With that said however, starting with a battery that was down to 17% when I connected the Power Companion, it only charged the laptop back to 74% after leaving things undisturbed for 5 hours.<br /><br />The directions could be a tad more explicit, it took a few minutes to figure things out, but once I realized which cord to use, things went smoother.  Also, be aware that you will need the original charger unit to plug this into."
3.0,Good product. Enough space to carry your laptop and a lot accessories in spite of it doesn't looks bigger...
3.0,"I recently managed to buy what is apparently one of the biggest, if not the biggest laptop still available on the market (an ASUS g751). It's 17.3&#34; and 8.4 pounds. None of my myriad carrying solutions is sufficient to fully enclose the beast and I am partial to protecting it when mobile.<br /><br />I bought this Case Logic backpack solution as it was highly regarded by other reviewers. The features and benefits of the pack are as described and It has proven to be rugged, comfortable and efficient for all the extra stuff I stow (not only is the g751 huge and cumbersome,but it's power adaptor is also large and awkward).<br /><br />I took two rating stars off because when I firmly nestle the laptop down as far as it will go and give an extra tug to the pack's fabric siding, the zipper strains around the corner of the laptop and the device,s shape can be discerned from how it distorts the carrier.<br /><br />Since I bought this for one purpose: to port around a leviathan of a laptop. The laptop is a 17.3&#34; device which the pack is billed to fit. While I don't do gymnastics with it on I suspect that the strain from the weight compounded by how tightly the zipper's teeth have to clench around the device that I'll probably be replacing it because of a busted zipper or torn fabric.<br /><br />Shame on me for not getting out measuring tape and double-checking...I foolishly assumed a 17.3&#34; pack that claims to hold a 17.3&#34; laptop would require extra precautionary steps to ensure it would actually contain the g751 17.3&#34; computer. I knew going into this that the device was unwieldy."
3.0,This was an ok mic but it broke after not that long. Maybe a few months.
3.0,"Bought this one because another one by another manufacture made too much noise with the tablet was secured in it.  This one is much quieter, no noise with it in or out; however, the build is not that high of quality.  The padding on the bracket to protect your tablet is already falling off.  In addition, the way the tablet mounts is top heavy causing it to swing down (not fall off, the bracket just swings down) unless you consistently re-tighten the bracket before every use."
3.0,"These headphones provide really nice sound, and the noise cancelling is pretty decent. And they are nice and lightweight.  But I found them to be uncomfortable after wearing them for over an hour on a long flight."
3.0,ok
3.0,"Had the same problem as others.  It's pretty unbelievable, but this product is too wide for a standard 3.5&#34; drive bay.  You must do some filing/sanding to get it in there.  Most likely you will still end up jamming it in.  Almost sent mine back due to my disgust level.  Decided it was not worth the bother.  Stupendously crazy situation.<br /><br />The 4-pin power connector is very, very cheap, and extremely short.  I replaced mine with a much sturdier spare I had lying around.<br /><br />The USB cable does not have a motherboard header connector on the end; it has a standard USB male plug.  You would think they would show this in the pics...oh well.  The USB cable is 17.5&#34; long.  You can route it through a hole, or an empty slot in the rear to a back-panel USB connector.  That was too much of a jury-rig for me.  I purchased an adapter with a 5-pin motherboard header on one end, and a USB female on the other, so I could connect it to the motherboard.<br /><br />The whole thing is rather wonky, and there is some play in the USB connectors.<br /><br />Mine has two lights on it; a red one for power, a green one for when a device is connected.  No telling what you may get.<br /><br />Other than the physical problems, it works OK."
3.0,"I purchased this item a few days ago and it was easy enough to setup by logging thru its web tool menu. www.tprepeater.net<br /><br />I was hoping that it would provide better 5GHz coverage (compared to another range extender such as Netgear AC750 EX6100) but it did not.<br /><br />You really have to be at least between 10-15 feet in order to get good AND consistent signal.  Any further you begin to lose signal or get disconnected.<br /><br />The 2.4GHz signal and coverage fared better.  I tested it by putting it on the 2nd Floor and situating myself on the 1st Floor and vice versa.<br /><br />This was tested using Verizon FiOS 75/75 Mbps service and connected thru an AC1200 Dual Band Gigabit router.<br /><br />My irritation with this product is that there is no way to 'Hide the SSID' feature unlike the Netgear AC750 EX6100 range extender or others out there.  So beware of those prying eyes and WiFi piggybackers and freeloaders!  It does provide the maximum security available WPA2.<br /><br />I emailed TP-Link Technical Support and received this response:<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />Thank you very much for your email requesting information about our product.<br /><br />I am sorry to tell you that RE210 does not support hide the SSID currently.

I'll post an update if we end up using it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this product upon reading reviews and recommedations of its current users.  It is also designed compactly, non-intrusive with other outlets and it seemed to be well-priced.<br /><br />I wish TP-Link would've considered all the other features that most AC750 range extenders have.

3.0,"unnecessary, but still okay to buy"
3.0,"i am not sure how to delete email accounts that i dont want , and also the email history. It keeps my password and wont clear it . when i am checking a random email account"
3.0,One of the antennas was missing; did not come in the box
3.0,Would not stand up the way I wanted.
3.0,Charges devices much slower than shorter cables and Apple cables.
3.0,"I bought this battery as a replacement for the stock Sony Vaio battery that I had been using for about 3 years.<br /><br />This battery worked fine as a replacement, but doesn't work nearly as well for a few reasons.  First, the battery itself looked different than as pictured.  The actual battery that arrived protrudes from the laptop about an inch, tilting the laptop downward.  This isn't normally an issue, but because the battery sticks out, it can often get caught on my desk if I'm trying to slide the laptop closer to me.  This can cause the battery to get pulled out completely, shutting the computer down unexpectedly.  Also, the battery does not charge nearly as fast as the stock battery.  While the computer is in use, it takes about 4 1/2 hrs to get to full charge from 10%.<br /><br />This product works fine, and it keeps a charge much longer than the old one I was using previously, but because of the issues above I would have a hard time recommending it to friends."
3.0,Doesn't fit my lifeproof case.
3.0,Only a few weeks in and it shows signs of wear in the area of use. Used a G502 on it. Now using a MX518 because the g502 was garbage.
3.0,As expected in description
3.0,doesn't hit read/write speeds as specified
3.0,"Nice cover except I could only use the top which is wee bit loose, the bottom part didn't fit even though it listed it was for Macbook Air."
3.0,"Yes it is a nice tablet, a little bit heavier than i thought.. to read its just fine."
3.0,"Nice back lighting, not too bright, not too dim. Also the key presses are very nice to the touch and are not loud. But after a month or so of very light use the backspace key stopped working."
3.0,"The Kindle was a gift from my son and I am still getting to know it. I have ordered a new book with the upmost ease. My next project is to get connected with the library system. I need reading glasses, read in bed in the evening and find this is wonderful--no glasses and well lighted."
3.0,"Had this Grantwood Technology charging device for about 8 months. It works alright for the Kindle Fire, but seems to be rather slow to charge. I would advise getting a charger that delivers more power. Sometimes my Kindle flashes &#34;connected to slow charging device&#34; or something to that effect."
3.0,I've using two of these on my new TS-253p for a week now and it looks like they are performing like expected.<br />WD and Amazon are advertising these drives as NASware 3.0 but I received one 2.0 manufactured in 2013 and another with 3.0 manufactured in 2015. Based on what I read it looks like is not a big deal in an event of a failure but still the description from the manufacturer is misleading. I will also post some feedback to the seller about the way Amazon ships drives.
3.0,Product construction not as expected.
3.0,"I'm not a pro gamer or anything, but I've been using this set for about 8 months, and I'm not really sure if this is the way it's supposed to be for this kind of keyboard and mouse.<br />Pros<br />Very Sleek<br />Great design<br />Very responsive keys<br />Looks great at night<br /><br />Cons<br />Back light has to be turned on when you need it.<br />Keys are only visible when light it's on.<br />A little too much noise when typing.<br />Mouse left click started having responsiveness issues after some months of use.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />For a gamer I couldn't tell if this is the right mouse, but for me as casual user of video games and PC networking, I can say that this product has too many unused features, and some missing basic qualities, such as mute keys, mouse response, lightweight, and key guides or visible letters. Back-light it's not really necessary, but it's somewhat cool to see."
3.0,I love the unit ad a whole...it's small enough to fit in my laptop bag but big enough to my laptop.  I don't use it that much and the fan has stopped working.  I very disappointed in that.  I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for that.
3.0,Very unhappy there are a few apps that do not work with this tablet but work on other tablets not using lollipop.
3.0,Still having a hard time getting used to Windows 8.  I wish this tablet's battery supply was longer!
3.0,everything was great except for one magnet. I guess the glue used to keep the magnet in place wasn't used properly so one magnet came out right away. I just glued it back in and now it's decent
3.0,3 stars because I couldn't get it to work with my Mac.
3.0,"Comes off really easy, which I hate. Its okay."
3.0,Overall this works ok but it loses sync pretty often and I have to restart the computer to get it to work again. Somewhat annoying.
3.0,"The power connector looks like it was run over by a forklift. The bins are somewhat smashed, but eventually I was able to force it onto my drive. After that it seems to work ok. The instructions aren't very good, so I would not recommend this unless you know what you are doing with a bare drive."
3.0,"This is a good economical tablet for web browsing and basic functions like that.  My son uses this one and bought it specifically for his games.  The one MAJOR downfall of this tablet, especially if it is for kids who like to play games is that out of the 16gigs, it only allows you somewhere around 2 of those gigs for apps/games. We haven't as of yet found a way to reallocate the memory.  This is a point of real frustration and disappointment.  My son saved all of his birthday money up as well as money he earned to get this tablet only to be disappointed.  It's a great economical tablet if you aren't using it for games and it would be well worth your money."
3.0,Great looking bag. The handles seem a little oversized but big enough to carry as a shoulder bag.
3.0,"Works decent for my school work, but not good for watching videos or movies. You have to keep it at an angle to be able to see."
3.0,"Everything was going great.  I liked it.  I thought it provided the necessary protection.  However, it recent broke on one of the corners.  It had been kept in a sleeve in side a backpack.  Not sure how this happened but was not shoot about it."
3.0,Item is visual pleasing and is made well with above average material.  Down-side; there is no &#34;groove/slot&#34; to brace iPad / monitor when in upright hands-free viewing position.  iPad  falls backward or slide forward flatting which becomes annoying if watching a video or typing.
3.0,Great
3.0,"My son loved it, but I bought the leappad platinum for my daughter last Xmas and when the leappad 3 arrived I noticed how much smaller the screen was"
3.0,"I love the simple and industrial look of the design. It was easy to put on and I have dropped my oversized phone hard, twice, without any visible scuffs or damage to the case. Tough and nice for the price. Also, the landscape stand is a fun feature, though I've only had call to use it once in three weeks. BUT, I probably won't keep this case. There is a glitch with the volume button covers. I think it may be that the hard edges of the backing are just a little too close to the soft rubber button covers, but when I push volume down, almost every time it stays depressed, taking volume all the way down to zero. Then I have to push volume up to get it back to the desired level. I suppose I could try cutting the button covers off or shaving off a few milimeters of the soft inner button push, but for $12, I might as well just write it off and buy a better one."
3.0,Did not do the job when I had a cABLR cO. CONNECT IT.
3.0,The mousepad works great. The top surface of the mousepad started peeling back the first week i got it. It is almost peeled halfway off and I've only had it for a couple weeks.
3.0,As expected.
3.0,great price and product arrived on time thank you
3.0,It does tend to come out of the laptop port a lot but it was inexpensive and does provide power/charging to my laptop
3.0,"Does not match Asus zenbook, too spacey"
3.0,"I got this to play Majora's Mask and it works really well, but it is definetly generic. It doesn't quite fit nicely in your hands, and there is a small area in each joystick that doesn't do anything, but it prevents drift.<br />Overall, totally worth $9, considering it does what is intended, and the real version is around $40."
3.0,i am not sure if this might be to big for my computer?  it doesn't fit right on the corners.  other then<br />that i like it.
3.0,"Purchased to replace wrist strap on cane. From Amazon product pictures appeared that clasp holding strap to elastic piece was similar to key ring similar to the previous wrist strap. However, clasp is a ring with abutted ends. Installation was a bit difficult as I had to pry open the ends, slip through the cane post, then crimp ends closed. The strap works (and perhaps elastic allows for easier installation) however if you are purchasing to easily loop ring through cane post this strap is a bit more labor intensive than the photos suggest."
3.0,"Not a bad case for the price. Seems to be decently made and looks good.  I have two issues with it though.  One, the case covers too much of the screen making it a bit difficult to swipe the edge of the screen.  Two, the case also covers a bit too much of the power and volume buttons as well, making a bit difficult as well to get to the buttons.  I'd return it, but really not worth the time and effort."
3.0,"It was great having a long cable and worked great for 2 months. I bought this June 17 and now on August 29 i am getting an error reading &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34; on my iPhone 6, and it stops charging.  I had the same problem with non-apple charge cords in the past so I was careful to check that this was 'Apple Certified' but now it stopped working again."
3.0,****UPDATE**** Very disappointed.  Haven't even had the case 1 week and the gold coating is already chipping off the front of the case...   Nice case... feels durable but makes the phone very heavy. Also power and volume buttons very hard to press.
3.0,Used it with Adobe Connect.  The ball unit is very fragile and the gears can strip if you are not careful.
3.0,The item works.  Unfortunately it was the external drive that crashed and not the power supply.
3.0,"I am a little lost at the moment. I bought this and no matter how much I google, I can't seem to find anything on the internet with the issue I have. The mic keeps turning off on me and it is randomly that it happens. I thought it was a connection issue, but the mic is secure in its slot. I checked the drivers and everything is up to date. I also do not have the option of SBX or Scout mode when connected to my xbox one, so I do not like that they do not specify at all about how it exactly works. I am contemplating returning this because it is more trouble that what it is worth. I do enjoy the sound though. Great quality"
3.0,"Some of the parts were broken and out of place. But it wasn't something that it would be worth returning, nothing that's too noticeable but if you do look for it, you'll notice it."
3.0,"Not as well lit as I would like.  Will continue to use my Fire HD when at home, and take the glare free to the car wash, salon, etc."
3.0,"Mouse moves smoothly on it and that's pretty much all I want. It is perfect except that it has a really strange smell. I put it under sunlight for a week and it didn't work. It's been half a year now and finally I can't smell it unless I get very close to it, yet it still gives my mouse that smell since I use it on the pad for a long time."
3.0,"Unfortunately this product wouldn't work with my computer, each time I plugged it in my computer screen would turn black. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the USB ports on my computer or what, but it was quite disappointing. The box and instructions are all in another language, of course it is self-explanatory how to use the thing but I still want to be sure I'm using it correctly. I am starting the return process. It honestly is not bad for the price though."
3.0,Excellent delivery. Slightly disappointed with keyboard.
3.0,"I like the protection, but it's kind of bulky"
3.0,"Just got it delivers today. Took it out of package and noticed a warped crease in all 3 pieces.  I've been wanting an anti glare protector eagerly so I thought I'd try apply one anyway and see if the dented part would flatten out.  It became an exercise in frustration.  The creased part did flatten out somewhat but not completely, there're still 2 small lines with air under that would t go away no matter what I try. There's also other bubbles that are difficult to get rid off.  I read other reviews saying it takes several tries to get it right so I thought I may get better luck the more I practice- that's why 3 pieces were provided. Well, I ended up using up all 3 pieces and still have some bubbles and the creases won't go away.  I tried using the s pen on it and it works fine, so that part is good.  However, I still need a replacement or refund, since the item came damaged. ===UPDATE============= After contacting the seller, I was told to place another order on amazon and the price will be refunded to me after sending them my order number. So they did stand beyond their replacement warranty.  This time the package was better.  I watched several youtube videos on how to apply screen protector this time and the result was more successful, with only one tiny bubble. It took me about an hour though.  I wish it was easier. So now I change the rating from one star to 3."
3.0,It good but it falls out unfortunately.
3.0,stopped working after 5 months. asus rma process is hit and miss. if you get someone who speaks english it goes ok. if not then not so much. when it was working it worked very well.
3.0,Heavy and bulky than expected
3.0,"Bought to play Game of War on it, which of course would not run on it.  Otherwise might have been great, just not what I wanted it for."
3.0,"cost too much money for what you get, a plastic box made in China"
3.0,"if you have a MSI or ASUS AMD AM3+ board and use all four RAM slots it doesn't quite fit. it hits against the RAM in slot 4 and and bends it in a little when ther fan is tightened down. you can only orient the fan in two directions and it didn't fit in either direction....it would have worked if i took out the RAM chip in slot 4...too bad,  looked cool and was pretty easy to install...keeping it for maybe another project"
3.0,As described.. love the feel and color
3.0,It does not fit my ipad tightly and the case cannot stand. It is just okay for the price. I wish I just buy Apple original cover.
3.0,It looks like a good protector. But it is stained with some black colour from the laptop bag I use. So be careful if you want to have your laptop with this skin in a dark coloured bag.
3.0,"the scroll wheel mechanism does not allow you to remove the detent mechanism, for smooth scrolling."
3.0,I expected the color to be more on point but I still like it.
3.0,"I really liked this, but I do have a few complaints. It has very good picture quality especially for how cheap it was, and I loved that it had the manual focusing. The things that I didn't like were that it was very light so I had to tape it down so it would not move. Also for some reason it took forever to like my computer. I have a fairly new windows laptop and it took a couple of times of me plugging it in and pulling it out and plugging it back in. Overall it was just okay."
3.0,desk pod controller went bad.  ordered new one 15 dollars  info@cyberacoustics.com. thanks to S. Murphy at cyber acoustics
3.0,"The case looks great, however, it is not made exactly for this tablet. It covers a few important buttons (like the power button) and has a camera hole in a different place than the camera on the tablet. I'm not a fan of returning items due to shipping costs, so it will work for now. I guess there might have been a couple variations of this model..."
3.0,"It's a nice rubber case, but the stand is hard to fold, when the kids are watching videos."
3.0,Good and bad. It can cause screen issues on my iPad mini.
3.0,"Original battery holds up to 7 hours, but this only holds up to 3 hours..."
3.0,The battery life seems a bit shorter than my old kindle paperwhite.  I also find the adverts rather annoying whenever I open the cover.  I can't seem to find a way to cut these out.
3.0,"no way to turn off blue light, keeps lap top cool though"
3.0,The USB cable is not good.
3.0,Not as fast as I expect4ed for boot up.
3.0,"It was very, very difficult to set up.  We had to go thru 2 laptop computers, 2 different OS's, and 3 different Internet browsers until we got the right combination that communicated with the Wi-fi extender.  I still cannot access the functions of the program that updates it or allows changing settings but at least it does work as a wi-fi extender.  Why can't they include the program on a disk instead of the flaky URL connection?"
3.0,none
3.0,"It does exactly what I needed it for, which was to use my old non-HD monitors with my brand new PC. It works like a charm and required little to no setup other than plugging both ports into my pc/monitors. If you have a DVI compatible monitor and would like to use it in a modern computer, this is a good way to plug it in. Not much else to say other than it does the job and I'm satisfied with it."
3.0,"It worked well for only 3 months, and stopped charging.<br />Update: the seller replaced this item. I am now on my second charger. It is working fine. Will update in a few months if this one doesn't last."
3.0,"This is a nice screen protector. It's cut very precisely and fits the tablet very well; because of this it's a little more difficult to line-up with the screen without overhang. However, if applied properly it is very inconspicuous and looks great. The anti-glare properties are very disappointing. The protector reduces glare but not enough to make the screen significantly more readable under direct light; reflections are still very noticeable with this protector applied."
3.0,"Slim and therefore lacks a lot of space. It's fine for carrying around a 15 '6 laptop, a textbook, and some notebooks, anymore than that and it's a tight squeeze. Also, the zipper and straps seem rather fragile. After lifting the bag with only two textbooks inside, the top strap snapped off in one piece. Overall it's a simple bag with so-so build quality."
3.0,Very loud but it works.
3.0,Somewhat bulky but operates well.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Good length<br />Good braiding<br />Interesting colors<br />Seems well constructed<br />Cons:<br />As others have said, the micro usb portion is too long so it sticks out. This does not hamper the operation but in my opinion it could cause them to brake more easily.<br />They seem to work better in via a USB 3.0 port vs 2.0 at least with my Xbox One controller, which is odd as I think they should work the same in either port.<br />Need even more color choices<br />Summary:<br />Would probably buy again if needed.  But if someone sold the same items and fixed my list of Cons then I would purchase those."
3.0,"Cool design, but again, this is just more expensive that it should be."
3.0,"For casual users, I think they will be ok with this modem. That said, I personally had an issue with this one. If you are a gamer, toss it to the curb. Every 5-15 minutes, my ping to, say Google, would go from 35 to 560 for about 3 seconds. ISP confirmed there were no issues with my connection. Crippling for any online gaming. Range isn't great either.<br /><br />I just replaced it with a Motorola modem. No more issues."
3.0,"My family and I have used Belkin products before mostly as covers for our Kindle Fire's and this seemed like a nice product to try as an addition to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 that we have. I have been looking at possibly purchasing a new laptop or just getting a keyboard for my Galaxy. I decided to try this keyboard case in hopes of getting something that would keep me from shelling out big money for a new laptop and just see what I could accomplish with this keyboard case. Hopping that this would cure me of wanting a new laptop. I was pleased with the design of the case and the keyboard itself was very sturdy even though it didn't seem to add much additional weight to the overall product. In other words, it didn't seem overly bulky or cumbersome.<br />One of the issues that I had was that it didn't seem to pair very well with my tablet and connection kept dropping. Even though it started out as something I was very interested in and wanted to really be happy with it ended up rather disappointing. It does have a QWERTY keyboard with the functions of most laptop keyboards and the case itself fit very well. I was happy with how the case set up in the open position but when I was just using my Galaxy for reading I would just take it out of the case. Ultimately, even with some nice features,  I found that it was something that I really don't see myself using very much."
3.0,I wanted the Kindle with Wifi and 3G but this one only has wifi. When I realized this I tried to exchange it and was even willing to pay the upcharge but Amazon did not allow me to do so without paying for a whole new one. This was very disappointing to me as I have normally received good customer service from them but not this time around.
3.0,"These are ok.  Just for a child I think.  The sound does not come out evenly on both sides.  Our son does not notice, but I could never use these for any amount of time.  He finds them very comfortable and cool.  He would give them 4 or 5 stars."
3.0,The range is short. Won't work well for 5ft distance
3.0,Simple to configure. Video quality is not that good.
3.0,Nice while it lasted.
3.0,I haven't had to use it. If I do I'll adjust my rating accordingly.
3.0,"Missing the 3rd pin on one of the two outputs<br />When i got it, one of the 2 pwm outputs was missing the 3rd pin and so with some testing, i was able to move the 4th pin to the 3rds place. it was really strange to why one of the pins just didnt exist but since i dont have any pwm fans, it was a quick fix and works. In short, im sure it wasnt a design flaw, it was just maybe a quality oversight still recommend and dont need to return it :D"
3.0,They are loud but not as loud as I expected.
3.0,"Really like the design, and the fact that it can be used both as backpack and shoulder bag. Neat.<br />The one main complaint is that the zipper for the large compartment broke (the slider got disconnected) after four days of normal use. That part of the bag seems under-dimensioned for the wear and tear it will go through. The zipper is 'incorporated' with the bag, which means there is no way to reattach the slider. As the main compartment opens sideways, this makes the bag useless as a backpack."
3.0,"Seems to be okay.  The instructions are not correct to connect the mouse, but just refer to the reviews to see the correct procedure."
3.0,"This product isin the bottom tier when it comes to SSD speed. I used this and an PNY 240GB value SSD in the same machine, same OS, etc and I could tell the difference easily. The PNY was much faster, and was only 10-15$ more. I would only use this in older/less powerful laptop/desktops."
3.0,A bit flimsy but works fine.
3.0,"Nice size, nice display. A little slower than I had expected. Love reading books on it."
3.0,"The surface is a little large for me, but that may be good for others. I would have also preferred a fuller base for balance, but I'm comparing it to one that was used for years. The survace of this is durable and can be wiped with a damp cloth. The light stores in a zippered area at the top of the padded bottom, so it does not always have to be out, but that also means it is felt on the lap while using the desk. I have no need for the drink holder, so it is not used."
3.0,"Case is okay, for the money. Pen fell apart within a week."
3.0,Worked but cabling is difficult to route.
3.0,"For $800-$900, I don't wanna get heavy weight laptop, slow hard, average battery.<br />I don't recommend it"
3.0,I bought this for my husband
3.0,"If you are going to offer a product that works only for one operating system, you need to put that information in the very first thing the potential customer sees. Our purchasing agent didn't read two paragraphs into the advertising hype, when it states this is a Win7 product only.  HP is one of the companies we use with confidence, but this Windows 7 Only device was a disappointment. You guys might want to make the limitations of this product a bit more obvious."
3.0,"The thing came with a free upgrade too Windows !0, which came out the day after I got it. Wow!! What a pain that was!!  It didn't load right & I had to restore system several times. I thought it ruined the machine, but I keep trying to make it work. Sometimes it will just zoom in and magnify what is on the screen. I'm not a pro computer guy, so I just keep pushing the minus size to reduce it, when it happens. I like being able to scroll down the screen with my finger, which really helps when the machine won't recognize the Mouse arrow, when I try to scroll with it. I suspect it is more the new software's fault then the machines.<br /><br />Al"
3.0,Good for the price
3.0,"I purchased two of these tablets for my daughter. The first one functioned well but slow. The second one required you to hold the power button for ~12seconds to start and it frequently locked up. It worked well when it worked but I had to reinstall apps regularly. I also own two fire kindles, a Samsung Galaxy and an iPad so it was easy to see the difference in video quality.  It is a good starter tablet for a child."
3.0,"Update ( 1 year 10 days later )<br /><br />Developed an air bubble on touchscreen, and won't stay on if not plugged in. I contacted iRulu which forwarded me to Amazon and got &#34; sorry out of warranty &#34; response. Good tablet for a year. Personally I won't buy from this brand again.<br /><br />Ordered IRulu Walknbook 10.1 Hybrid Laptop (the green one) Windows 8.1 was preloaded and had it upgraded to Windows 10, that took several hours so be prepared. You'll want to add a Micro SD (Sandisk Ultra 32GB not included) because Windows 10 is a big file and won't fit on the tablets internal hard drive. Inserted the Micro SD and it loaded very quickly and was able to use right away. The wireless keyboard is, honestly, a gift because the tablet is worth the $199 and works fine (it is a little on the flimsy and sometimes a glitch here and there but again it's a gift) Apps run smoothly, I installed malware, spyware, and antivirus without any problems but it is slow to scan (more of a overnight thing for very thorough scans ) The Microphone is nice to have but for serious microphone usage a third party one will be needed. I'm ordering a HDMI cord to hook up to my television I'm very hopeful for that and Finally the touchscreen is very responsive no issues whatsoever. I'll be getting a wireless keyboard for the TV use of it. The only Con would be the power input and micro USB are not as one. That would have been nice because micro USB is more common than the 2.5mm round pin connector.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the product would be very open to a 2nd one for the kids or future models because it is affordable for my use."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. As identified by CPUID, of the four supposed identical items in the package two were made by Crucial (refurbished as Crucial is their own seller only) and one that was PNY and one Kingston. The RAM PCB boards were different shades of green with A-Tech stickers on them. The latencies of the ram were the same for the Crucial and totally different for the other two. I expected 8GB Ram at 6400 speeds but only ended up with 5400 because one stick wasn't up to par. I bought 2 packages 4GB kit (2GBx2) of DDR2 PC2-6400 so 4 sticks of ram total."
3.0,Good picture easy to down load stuff but the volume is so low it's hard to hear it and there is no way to increase the volume unless you have superior hearing like bionic woman it's not a good buy
3.0,I am not truly satisfied.  I cannot slide to. English.  All the languages are speaking.  I cannot delete them.  I think instructions Should have been included along with the iPad.
3.0,"We connected this to a 2.0 USB port when my fiancee's ethernet port stopped working after the upgrade to Windows 10.  I am pleased to report that this adapter fixed problem, and does work on Windows 10 with included drivers!  The speeds are comparable to what they were before, but for one reason or another (perhaps using a USB 2.0 port instead of 3.0?) we have occasional unresponsiveness when loading webpages in Chrome.  Web pages occassionally refuse to load without clicking refresh, but downloads seem consistent and online gaming seems to work fluently.<br /><br />Overall, it is a steady connection with some occasional web browsing slowdown.  It is Windows 10 compatible, and with the exception of when it slowly/doesn't load web pages, it works fine.  Not the most consistent device with a 2.0 port, but with 3.0 it may perform much better.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for honest feedback!"
3.0,"The Logitech M320 is a stylish, functional mouse. The buttons and scroll wheel provide good feedback, and the invisible optical sensor tracks laminate smoothly. The sides of the mouse are not rubberized like the (less stylish) M310, but they provide adequate grip. I would have preferred if Logitech enabled configuration of this mouse through SetPoint and/or updated Logitech Options to support legacy devices since my older Logitech keyboard uses SetPoint."
3.0,"no documentation to help with the M-disc writing on MAC, despite sold as compatible."
3.0,Very nice when hooked to a tablet that it is compatible with. Not compatible with the tab 3. Wasn't very impressed with the mounts two broke in the first week. Aside from that works nice and not bad for the price.
3.0,"So far battery sucks, doesn't last long, doesn't hold charge,"
3.0,"I purchased this Inspiron 7348 2-in-1 three weeks ago, based on a good experience owning a Dell ten years ago, and I wish I hadn't done it. Two main issues: Basic functions such as wifi and charging are deeply problematic; purchasing experience from Dell also quite terrible. Long story short, I have fixed both of these issues, but it took a lot of Googling to learn how to get the basic functions working reliably and a lot of perseverance to get Dell to forward the appropriate refunds.  Basic Functions: Wifi drops, or connects erratically, or ignores my printer  -- all quite haphazardly. I am a working person with two jobs that require computing -- nonprofit management and college teaching -- so this has been very frustrating. Reading up on Google, I see that the random wifi drop is a long-known issue, at least as far back as 2010. My workaround for the wifi issue was to disable the internal wifi and add a wifi usb adapter. Works perfectly now, and immediately re-connected to my printer. These usb adapters are generally inexpensive (Net-Dyn under $10) but seriously; if it's that easy and inexpensive for a consumer to fix it, why can't Dell fix it?  The charger is another issue: constant error messages such as &#34;not recognizing charger&#34; and, early on, actually not charging! Scary. (Using Dell charger that came with the laptop.) Again, Googling showed, in dozens of forums, that it has been a known issue as far back as at least 2010. By accident, found a workaround, by having to use a two-prong adapter one day when there wasn't a grounded wall socket available. Ever since then, works perfectly, although still gives me error message (which is itself now an error).  Purchasing from Dell: This laptop, the one I wanted based on numerous professional reviews (a lesson right there -- go for customer reviews every time, and not on the Dell website either), was part of a promotional package including a &#34;free tv&#34; which I didn't want. Long process to get &#34;special permission&#34; (salesman's words) to drop the promotional tv, which he insisted was &#34;free&#34; and did not have its price included in the final price. However, when he gave me my final price, it was $170 less than before -- a &#34;discount&#34;. So much for &#34;free.&#34;  In addition, when I received my statement, I saw hundreds of dollars worth of service contracts I had either not ordered, or explicitly declined. At that point, I didn't even want the specific service contract I did order, so I requested a refund for all of them, and, by dint of constantly monitoring the process (and making sure I asked for everyone's &#34;name&#34; and contact info), I finally received $250 in refunds. (In case you are following along, the &#34;free&#34; tv plus the unwanted service contracts total $420 in &#34;discounts&#34; or refunds altogether, a not insignificant sum.)  Moral of the story: Be careful buying from Dell. Read user/customer reviews carefully first, not the CNet or PCMag type reviews, and not the ones on the Dell website. I now have this brand new computer reliably connected to wifi through an old-time connection system and charging well with a two-prong adapter. Imagine that, in 2015."
3.0,"I could not get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone. I tried with home and hotel wifi. Would connect, but never stay connected for more than a few seconds, no matter what I tried. I could use the usb drive connected, just not wifi. I easily returned for full refund. Couple of weeks later I bought Hootoo Tripmate Sith TM05 from Sunvalley Tek again. This time it was a success. I do have to turn off the cellular connection to stay connected with wifi."
3.0,This battery doesn't hold a charge as good as i think it should but it does work. I received it in good time. Have had really no problems with this product.
3.0,"Id like to say, There isnt as much treble as i'd like. The bass is more than enough and even though you can control the bass input with the knob I find it very difficult to find a nice adjustment on them. The desk speakers were a let down though. There's too much mid coming through and not enough high."
3.0,"I was very disappointed with the laptop, it was not what I wanted. I did a search for backlighted keyboards and this laptop was listed. If it lights up, I can't find a &#34;switch&#34;."
3.0,Does not work as a network drive as my previous LaCie Little Big Disk did.
3.0,A little to tight but very nice
3.0,"kind of dissappointed, had an ipad before, will buy another ipad next time"
3.0,"We've had it for a few weeks. It works. It has a background &#34;hum&#34; when there isn't anything being delivered. I'm not sure if it is the headphones or the computer I use them on, but I didn't have the hum with the other headphones I was using. Otherwise it sounds okay. We want some durability, and we won't know the answer to that issue for a while."
3.0,I got the packages and the lengths are correct but ITS NOT TEAL. It's GREEN. This disappointed me but overall the quality is great
3.0,Good case not great it does the job also holds 2 memory cards and business cards.
3.0,"I have both an iPad Air and an iPad Air 2.  Product works great for iPad Air and uploads hundreds of pictures from my Nikon SIM card in under a minute.  But unfortunately my iPad Air 2 does not recognize the device.  Five stars if not for that.  Since my first review, the product has stopped working for all my iPads (all on IOS 9).  It appears there is an issue in IOS  9 that affects devices like this.  From blogs and forums elsewhere, even the Apple SD Card reader does not work on IOS 9.  If anyone is aware of a work around please advise."
3.0,"One major design flaw keeps this from being a 5 star product - the PC board. It's simply too low to the bottom that it interferes directly with the capacitors on the edge of the motherboard. Thus, you can not use it &#34;as intended&#34; - at least on my board, as well as many others based on reviews. I made a mount and mounted it in my 3.5&#34; drive by internally. It's annoying to have to open the case to power the lighting on and off, but since I keep my computer off during the nights to conserve power anyways, the lights or normally running 24/7 when the PC is on.<br /><br />3ft is plenty to do a nice ambient effect inside of your case, I feel the 2m length would have been slight overkill as these LED are plenty bright even on the lowest setting. I'm using them in a Phantom Original with a modified window side panel, accenting a Red/Black build with white / red / blue fans.<br /><br />Works as intended with the exception of the mounting for the switch.<br />3 solid stars."
3.0,"It is too heavy for me, and I found I didn't use the keyboard much at all."
3.0,The Ethernet port kept losing connection. Bought and external card and problem solved. Returning it is not an option since the computer being used for work and if I return it I will lose money. The external card was $20 so it was worth it.
3.0,The challenge is that you have to fold your cable in half and hook it on the reel and then it rolls up both sides together.  Then when you unwind it is a challenge to pull cable off to get the reel to stop and prevent it from winding again.  Does keep your cables nicely wound up.
3.0,It OK you get what you pay for .
3.0,Works pretty good. Just bought a internal wifi adapter thinking it would work much better. It didn't. And it cost 30 dollars. So this is a good cheap way to go.
3.0,It works well but I am disappointed in the range.  POE and the management interface work well.
3.0,made headphones sound tinny and seemed to have some potential shorts. Ya get what ya pay for! It was very cheap. I would advise paying a few bucks more to get a better quality product.
3.0,I didnt like this product as much as I hoped. Its smaller than I expected and not very comfortable to have on my lap.
3.0,Had to return them.  We ordered the wrong thing.
3.0,Don't use very often.
3.0,"This is better than the plastic version of screen protector, but inferior to the Anker glass screen protector.  I could not get it to lay flat at the edges, there is a little overhang so there is a little hollow edge around the entire perimeter, and a corner that has an air pocket of my ipad3.  I purchased the Anker screen protector for my husbands ipad air, it was 1/2 the price of this one and is perfect ... plus the company did a backflip for us when my husband broke it while he was installing it, and sent a new one out free of charge!  If Anker made one for ipad3 I would have returned the intelliglass one without a doubt, since it just doesn't really fit."
3.0,It does a great job when it's closed but it doesn't hold up my tablet very well. If I use it to watch a movie I constantly have to move the cover back to the rift position.
3.0,Be nice if it had a longer cord
3.0,The keyboard cover stopped laying flat on my keyboard long ago and the purple has faded quite a lot.
3.0,"I purchased 15 of these to make an extra battery pack for my electric bike and tore all of them apart. The individual battery cells inside the pack are rated at 1800 mAh which are on the lower end of 18650 cells. Although the cells are generic no brand Chinese cells in green color, they are not fake since I did a capacity test using my Imax B6 smart charger and their real capacity was around 1700-1800 mAh. Therefore the real capacity of the whole battery is 3600 mAh or 40 Wh so the 5200 mAh rating on the package is not true.<br />The overall quality of the battery pack is OK, however there is a very critical issue with the battery management circuit board inside the pack: THERE IS NO TEMPERATURE SENSOR! I don't care about this, because I just needed the cells out of the pack and threw the rest away, however for someone who is going to use this in their laptop, it is not safe! the battery might overheat while charging and melt or catch fire since there is no temp sensor. Be aware of this and do not buy these if you need a safe battery for your laptop."
3.0,"Loved the tablets they were a little hard to set up and will be fine for teenagers who are more tech savvy but not so much for an older person, although they fit nicely in your purse and the pictures was clear it was hard to get the programs to get to work properly.  The case colors were nice and they charged easily.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way."
3.0,its a printer cord if it does its job then its worth it...although I really think it should come with the printer and not be sold separate.
3.0,"I ordered this particular battery because I searched in Amazon for a replacement  for an old HP G60 &#34;Altec Lansing&#34; laptop and this came up and the price was reasonable.<br />It arrived on time and dropped right into place and I started to use it. However..............<br />I have noticed that the wall charger (aka brick) gets uncomfortably warm. I am worried that it may melt, short and start a fire.<br />Switching back to the old and lifeless original battery keeps the charger much cooler.<br />I looked closely at the replacement battery and noticed that its ampere rating is 5200mAh versus 4700mAh for the old one. So the new battery seems to be drawing more current and heating things up.<br />I don't feel comfortable leaving it connected to the charger for too long."
3.0,"Would not buy again.....times out and is a pain to get started again.  Is ergonomically uncomfortable to use, and a waste of money for the wireless.  Buy a plug in!"
3.0,"Not what was  described ,  trouble to use<br />Not really effective against drops and bangs<br />And fairly expensive"
3.0,Doesn't seem to keep a charge or charge completely
3.0,"When it works, it is a solid headset, even with drivers installed and every. This Headset is not True 7.1 surround sound as advertised it is only emulated through software, but it is still superb.<br /><br />there is a problem i am constantly getting with it though that is knocking the stars down by 2, it will randomly turn off even after a full charge, and it is the most annoying thing if i am in a call and all of the sudden my headset turn off, its just a minor annoyance that turns into a big one when its every 15 minutes for an hour."
3.0,"I really love the color and it fit really well on my MacBook Pro,  and the price was really great it just didn't last very long before it broke"
3.0,"after 6 months of normal usage, it starts to crack and broke. Cheap plastic I guess. You get what you pay"
3.0,"This card is on the short list of cards rated for the GoPro series camera. I found it too slow compared to the new ones out there right now (Aug 2015) which are up to 80GPS from the 45GPS. It worked OK, but you do notice the speed is so much slower which I thought was rather important since you are dealing with 64 GB. 50% fast means several minutes."
3.0,Difficult to work with as it kept sticking to the wrong sheet for application. Took a while to get it on the transparent sheet so i could apply it. Looks good once it's on however.
3.0,Weak signal. Sent back
3.0,"Ok it is USB 3.0 on the outside, data transfer and recognition of USB 3.0 devices .... i better don´t start to curse here .... kept it because cheap and the buttons are great to switch on/off attached equipment like headset/camera etc. when needed. DON´T by tu use it for your USB 3.0 HDD or USB drives LOL!!!"
3.0,"My cable seems to actually have a big of packet loss, curious if it's due to the nature of it being flat or because of less shielding than other cat6 cables.  So, I am not recommending you buy this unless your network can tolerate that."
3.0,Be careful. The keyboard is no longer available.
3.0,The case is OK - the problem is that the top part where the sleep button is - it gets stuck.... like the case pushes the button in and it stays pushed in.  It's all funky.  It would be great if it wasn't for that.
3.0,I have to replace every six weeks as they end up getting bent on the end
3.0,Unfortunately it didn't protect a screen crack when it slipped from my hand and fell.
3.0,"Didn't work out for me.  Not clearly stated that a transmitter needed too, & didn't feel like spending more money.  Sold it on EBay."
3.0,"Is an excellent router, install it is very easy"
3.0,For the price it it ok
3.0,"a little snug, but I do believe my Sony Vaio Flip 13.3 is slightly wider than the average 13.3 laptop. Despite my title, I did not wash it, nor would I. I just thought it would be run to rip on the Sleeve aspect."
3.0,Uncomfortable but actually practical. Shield is in the way usually so i took it off
3.0,The print is a bit loud but it fits well.
3.0,Okay
3.0,Looks like a good product
3.0,Ok sound
3.0,"UPDATE 4/15/16... Look Out!  to small of memory and hard drive... They should know this when selling as a good unit for students!   Purchased this unit on 8/8/2015 for $299.00 + extra warranty years for extra money.  Unit is still working well for my son at college, however DO NOT BUY this low memory (RAM 2GB) or low hard drive, 32GB unit as it can NOT handle any of the newer programs and the amount they require to run correctly.  I found out the hard way and now the unit is almost useless for a student or office working conditions. Spent many hours talking to help desk/techs/and local repair shops to find out it can not have windows 10 + M/S office working together without grabbing all the memory.  We can not upgrade the software now due to low memory.  It always freezes now and we end up having to reset/dump pending files all the time just to get it to run for a day or two. We thought it was a very good unit..  It is but don't buy the min memory or hard drive.  First review out of the box...... This was one of the better buys I made for my sons college requirements.  Although I question how much &#34;school&#34; type work he does on it as every time I see him he is on some social or gaming site.  He informs me it is way cool and does the job.  He was worried at first about the &#34;hinge&#34; where the units comes apart until he had on hands experience with it and tells me there is little or no worry now.  Seems to be built well there. (we will see as he is a football player).  He does like the size and fits easily in his backpack.  Tells me its easy to handle in class and on the field when needed.  Also lasts about three to five hours of real use (not standby). I am hopeful it will last the two years.  I did purchase the extended 2 year drop/service program as I have replaced his iPhone four times in two years. I smartened up and bought the 2 year service after the first year there!  I use to fight it, but they are active 17-20 year old somethings that are full of life.  The way I look at it is I pay a little extra to back ME up not them. The computer is a good deal and works as two units.  I hope apple comes out with that style in the future as we are a mixed family of PC laptops/apple desk tops, and iphones-ipads.  Why do we need all this crap?  Ha!  UPDATE 10/1/15 - Still working well and does the job, however we didn't get there clean.  First problem was updating windows 10.  Afterwards things started (software wise) coming apart.  Icons started dropping off, the internet icon just disappeared. Next the USB port stopped working and other little things.  Called/Chat ASUS service and was online about 45 min going over and downloading things (drivers/Bios) updates that did not take in the upgrade.  That so far has corrected all the issues.  I will say the rep/agent I got was very good and seemed to be cool with me not understand some of the terms they used.  I do recommend for ALL users to purchase more memory or drive chips. Load all non system software on them to free up the hard drive for your system use.  We really like this system and hope it will last."
3.0,Works as expected.
3.0,"Not sure if it's my laptop's power port or the charger, but it needs re adjusting ALL the time, it's actually very tedious. If I could get another and it works perfectly I'll change my review to 5 stars. The length on the cord is amazing however, never have to worry about getting to an outlet."
3.0,Works fine. Got it plugged into a Toshiba laptop. Got to keep devices plugged in specific ports as if you unplug and mix the serial/USB ports get confused and keep adding ports in the device settings.
3.0,It is a good travel size. Microsoft replaced the traditional scroll wheel with touch strip. They did feel the need to make it feel like a clicking wheel when you scroll. Totally unnecessary! I thought something was broken in the mouse at first. The scrolling is not very consistent either. The page doesn't  move in unison with your finger movement. The bluetooth connection isn't great either. It will disconnect intermittently.
3.0,"The unites work well.  They do feel somewhat cheaply made, but nothing much too expect give then price.  They are good enough for school use."
3.0,"I have bought this three times because the plug insert opening on the headset and the charger line plug are weak. After about half a year or so, they become deformed (i.e, bent, etc,.) and the contact between them becomes bad and it cannot charge power any more. So I had to order another one for replacement. The current one is a third one I bought. Other than that defect, the product is fine. I think the defect is a critical defect."
3.0,"mic doesn't seem to work.  I have to yell and the other person on Teamspeak says they can barely hear me.  sound quality is decent though.  Cord is terribly short.  I have my PC under my desk and have them plugged into the back and this allows me enough room to sit straight up with my legs under my desk, but I can't lean back or they fall off from the short cord!"
3.0,"Well, it works, but it is very picky about how the ethernet cable is set in it, if it gets bumped even a little, it will disconnect."
3.0,"I use a MacBook Pro and while downloading the driver for Macs was easy enough on the AOC site, not being able to control the contrast or brightness on the monitor became a big problem.  Within an hour my eyes hurt and I had a headache.  The monitor was too bright and seemed like it was vibrating.  I messed with the display options/tried to download programs to control external monitor brightness, but nothing worked.  You can't even calibrate properly without being able to control the brightness/contrast.<br /><br />This is a really great deal for the price, but i recommend only using with PCs.  I've looked in to it a bit and looks like for mac users GeChic monitors are a better option."
3.0,I was hoping for better sound quality but for the price they are ok.
3.0,I find it hard to type with the keyboard cover .  I will keep keyboard covered for protection - and the look .... And hopefully get used to feel of cover .
3.0,This does not work with Google. So beware. Better to get the Edge-n or the NEO that supports U2F which is more prevalent with Cloud based services. I'm having to return mine.
3.0,"The hard drive comes sealed on an anti-static bag held by special suspensor so the packaging is great. Something interesting I found is that though the drive itself says it is 1TB (LBA 1.953,525 168Sectors), it says as well at the label that the capacity is of 8455 MB (CYL16383, H16, S63)"
3.0,good.!
3.0,Cord is shorter than original one. The adapter also gets extremely hot.
3.0,I like the rotating screen and color but disappointed that in the desktop position the screen keeps falling.
3.0,"This iPad cover fitted perfectly on my iPad 3, but the corners were sort of hard to fit in at first. This ipad cover didn't hold up as much as I wished it had. The leather started to wear off by the tab and edges after 6 months. I thought it would hold up since belkin is a good brand that I have bought other products from. It wasn't as durable as I expected it to be but it was good while it lasted."
3.0,Great headset but if you spread them to put over your head they tend to break
3.0,"Only three usb ports. the optical DVD drive takes two and the mouse one, where do you plug the printer in?"
3.0,Good mouse. The feel is not for me. I've learned that my hand prefers a larger mouse. If you do too then this mouse may be a bit too small. though it is a great value solution.
3.0,"I am having trouble using the paper white , but I figure it is due to my lack of experience with this sort of device , no trouble buying books almost to easy . Hard for me to hold as it is touchy and I keep turning pages with out meaning to ,very light and easy to read I have to figure how to do things on it and being old makes it hard for me. I read more than most people so it is a big help to be able to get the books with out going to the library. I read at least a book a day. Thanks for the prompt service Virginia"
3.0,Doesn't last long.
3.0,"It is a good price but it does not fit perfectly, smooth. Also when I have shorts and use the laptop in my lap and I open the computer the case pinch my skin and is SUPER painful...."
3.0,"It does work tho sometimes pulling or pluging something in will cause other things (flash drives,etc) too be not readable unless you fiddle with them. Kinda wish they made frame a little more stronger and not wobbly."
3.0,Case fits great. Screen protector glass seems to have slight impact on responsiveness when typing etc
3.0,Did not fit fit my iPad 2 as it said it would
3.0,"It fits, but there was a little damage on the edge and fingerprints leave smudges to look dirty. It looks nothing like the picture."
3.0,"Super cool to be able to watch my over the air programming on my xbox one.  The guides are clean and responsive but directly changing channels is a bit slow.  I had my antenna connected to my Sony TV prior to buying this and it worked great as far as reception goes.  The Hauppauge Tuner does work mostly well.  However I lost about 4 or 5 channels that work perfectly on my Sony TV.  If you have really high signal strengths in your area you should be good if you are in an area where its a bit weaker you might not be happy.  My biggest complaint is I spent about an hour trying to troubleshoot why it wasn't working out of the box, xbox simply wouldn't see it, it would only light up for a few seconds at a time.. Turns out the USB extension cable was bad, even my laptop wouldn't recognize the device, swapped out the extension with one of my own and it works without issue.<br /><br />This was an experiment to try and centralize how I was accessing all my content.  But now I'm starting to feel I may have to go back to my TV since the signal quality is so poor now.  I'm a bit bummed..."
3.0,Great at first but didn't last long. The teeth that connects to your phone wouldn't stay in the phone after a couple of months.
3.0,its not stable case
3.0,delivery time is perfect.quality is good eventhough not perfect.
3.0,"I hate using my laptop at home, because it doesn't have a numeric keypad, so I jumped at the chance to try this. One of my favorite things about it was that setup was simple, you just plug the dongle into the computer and wait for it to install, which takes less than a minute. However, the keys aren't the most pleasant to type with. They type the number you want, but it's often hard to tell if it did or not. When you press them, it almost feels like there's something soft under the keys. I would have preferred if they &#34;clicked&#34; more or felt more decisive when you pressed them. Also, There's no power button, so you have to take out the batteries after use, or they will be drained. I made this mistake. Not bad, I'm glad to have this, but it's not my favorite. I received this item free for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"This is a mixed call on this product.  I returned the unit as it was used as a repeater about 45 feet down the hall in a clear path to help keep a strong signal throughout the house.  Most the time it would pickup the signal from my Netgear #1600 dual band router.  But from time to time it would &#34;fade&#34; and or drop the signal all together (and you know what that means). That does not work for me, the other issue was it would not pickup the pass code's for the dual bands.  It took only one pass code/password and allowed users to use any band.  Netgear lets you apply different codes so your higher band is used ONLY as you direct.  This unit did not let me have that option.  So back it went and I will try another brand."
3.0,"The tablet is good, no problem so far, but I got a non-functional charger!!! I think they just picked up a random charger, because it is not even manufactured by Samsung! Other than that, I like the tablet. I hope amazon will consider replacing the charger or something..."
3.0,Nice keyboard/mouse combo that is good for anyone building a brand new budget PC set.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Mouse wheel can get pretty squeaky.<br />Mouse clicks?(lack of a better word) can get stuck and cause one left (or right) click to click twice and cause some issues.<br />Keyboard doesn't allow for multiple keys to be pressed.
3.0,"Cool art, but the quality in person is a lot less than what i expected."
3.0,I am not very techy so this was difficult for me to figure out and consequently use.  I'm sure it was no fault of the product more likely &#34;User error&#34;.
3.0,"Alright the car fits over the tab, it was not made for a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch.  It covers the charging port and is hard to use the menu and back buttons.  Would've been a great Case if not for this."
3.0,Not a tight fit.
3.0,these are okay but sometimes when you crimp to tightly the clips on the ends get bent down and they do not secure into the jacks
3.0,"If you are going to offer a product that serves only one release of one operating system, you might want to make that a bit more prominent...like, oh, I dunno. Maybe within the first two sentences of the product subscription? It's 2015. We have rovers and orbiters on/around other planets, and even RealPlayer doesn't suck any more. There's no excuse for such a limited product when it's not pointed out immediately."
3.0,Should have gotten the one with the light.
3.0,"great for the price, however not very good touch screen"
3.0,Cheap but looks nice. One of the ears stopped working after a few weeks from the day I purchased it. Most likely loose contacts.
3.0,It's a decent protection pad. The fact that I had to put all 6 thin sticking tapes to the pad for it to become sticky was very antiquated and time consuming if one wants to make it look perfect.
3.0,didn't need it.
3.0,"It is hard to type on this computer. It registers other letters than what I typed. I don't know why, also I am going to put more hard drive into it to make it faster. it is OK. I had to upgrade to Windows 10. I just don't know why when I type certain keys they don't show up on the screen. I really wanted a Lenovo, but I couldn't afford it, I thought the keyboard would be better."
3.0,"Got this quickly to replace my old headset that died. I like it, it's good quality, but you need to plug in the USB and both plugs, kinda confused as to why they have the USB on it if I still need to plug in the microphone and headphone jacks  Update: Well after 3 e-mails and 2 calls at 10pm at night from the company telling me what the USB is for and telling me to give them a 5 star rating, I will not change the rating simply because I feel a bit harassed. The USB is to light up the headphones, wow, so amazing."
3.0,The range isn't what I expected.
3.0,"Pros: Somewhat light for a gaming laptop, great performance, doesn't heat up too much.<br /><br />Cons: Screen is kind of tinted so it has bad viewing angles, gets hard disk failure every once in while, I received one with defective speakers.<br /><br />This laptop has a history of hard disk failures and other defects from other customers. Overall it is a great laptop if you can get one that is not defective, but the chances of that are slim. There are other ASUS laptops with better reviews, I would suggest looking at those.<br /><br />I would recommend getting a laptop with a 965m, since it is not that much more and you get even better gaming performance."
3.0,It's pretty lightweight and cheap.
3.0,Only reason i gave it 3 stars is the fact that it sparks every time i plug it in. You can still use it but i dont know if you can leave it on the whole day.
3.0,I give this 3 stars because a the monitor Kept shutting off while I was trying to use the computer. But the seller was wonderful to work with to get the problem handled
3.0,too heavy
3.0,Cumbersome to use.  Ads pop up all the time.  Carousel hinders more than helps.  I like to use hard copy of instruction manuals but I cannot find a way to print one so ordered one.<br /><br />I think Amazon Prime is great.  The fire is an ok buy for the money.
3.0,It does work. It fits my 2014 model Mac Mini but it is a very tight fit indeed.
3.0,Everything was great except the hard drive space is much too small. I need a small back up DJ music computer but this past all tests except hard drive.
3.0,It serves it's purpose but it turns the kindle on if you accidentally open it even the tiniest bit. I wish it had an outter pockecy since I use my kindle case to store things
3.0,"Excellent deal via Amazon promo, but the screen is so dark. I knew it wasn't lighted, but this is pretty dim. Ended up finding a Paperwhite on eBay for great price and it's much easier to read!"
3.0,Need extra deep box or open wall - connecting a HDMI cable on the back side to a standard box will not fit
3.0,Numerous issues keeping both tablets linked to WiFi and Bluetooth keyboard
3.0,A lot bulkier than I expected.
3.0,"OK, I want to write this reviews to tell your the truth. I love thinkpad and I do not mean not to by thinkpad, I have received it for half a month, and I find some problem about this item! 1. The SSD in this laptop is a very cheap one and it is a primary product! So the voice will be more louder than other laptop'And also because of this problem, the computer will heat hot very quickly! 2. When I put my computer in the table, it is not stable. The 4 fulcrum is not in the same level. I don't believe it. So I put it in  absolute horizon vibration isolated table, it is still not stable.  3. I really not satisfied with the screen about this item. It is really a bad screen. I asked them how to solve this problem and they do not give the reply! 4.The lip of this computer can not be closed tight"
3.0,it's alright.
3.0,"I have been using this for about a year. It is still working nicely, def worth the money."
3.0,"The drawing area is way too small for most tasks -- even as an entry level tablet, and the thing feels a bit flimsy. It works just fine other than that."
3.0,"I ordered this in conjunction with a Excelvan 32GB Wi-Fi car black box/car DVR Recorder, as suggested by Amazon and customers..  The dash cam broke just days after the return policy time expired.  Now I have no use for this product either. The disk operated as expected, was hard to reinsert but still was able to be used.  The camera was the problem, leaving me with a disk for which I have no use. Of course that was the attraction, being able to record while driving and then download if needed."
3.0,"working fully and correctly but just a little bit of unexpected issue, its showing 124g instead of 128 that it was suppose to be...."
3.0,OK
3.0,"I wanted to love this keyboard. I researched the legendary blue switches and everything. It’s great for touch typing, and if that’s all you do, you’ll probably be satisfied. But the keyboard has several flaws which ultimately forced me to abandon it. (I used the Das Keyboard with an Apple iMac for about five months.)<br /><br />First, it can be painful to use. If you use the Command keys (on either side of the space bar) frequently, it’s going to hurt. I use Cmd-Tab and Cmd-Bracket extensively to navigate apps, tabs, and files, employing my thumbs on the Command keys, with my wrists on the table. As others have mentioned, the Command keycaps have a sharp edge — polished, of course, but still sharp enough to dig into your thumbs. This was the real deal-breaker.<br /><br />Other issues include:<br /><br />Fewer F-keys (15, vs. 19 on the Apple extended keyboard).<br /><br />Asymmetrical modifier keys. Mac users will feel disoriented by the extra, and useless, modifier key on the right side of the keyboard.<br /><br />Illegible keycaps. The tiny trendy typeface on the keys is impossible to read, and even though I can touch-type, I’m usually juggling a keyboard, tablet & stylus, and a trackball all at once, so I’m rarely near my home keys. I purchased some large print labels (http://tinyurl.com/mnreskg) to address this issue (see photo). These are high-quality 3M adhesive-backed labels but their application needs to be very precise or you’ll feel the edges of the labels sticking out.<br /><br />Design. It’s an exact replica of the original keyboards, except for the beautiful glossy black exterior. But for some reason I had expected it would be better than the original. Nope — just the same clunky casing and non-ergonomic layout. Big and boxy, the Volvo of keyboards.<br /><br />Sound. I liked the sound, though I would have preferred it to be quieter. But the tone of the Delete key (different keys sound different) really got to be irritating, driving home precisely how much I had screwed up the typing and how much time I was wasting!<br /><br />I’ve returned to my flat Apple Chiclet keyboard and really appreciate it now. Despite its drawbacks, it seems easier to use than the Das Keyboard."
3.0,"Surely it generally does what it claims to do.  Although, beware: if you have intentions of plugging your keyboard into it, the USB ports on your keyboard basically become useless.  All-in-all, it's a nice, handy product but it definitely doesn't fit in seamlessly with the iMac and/or its accessories such as the optical super-drive.  Apple products are indeed metallic but they are matte-finished with a higher-end look while this product is glossy with a plastic look.  Oh and it won't lay flat on your desk if you have a 27&#34; iMac like me -- you'll have to put something like the optical super-drive under it."
3.0,Good tank you
3.0,"For $6 it is kind of worth it in a pinch, but this will fail on you. I got about 3 months on this particular charger, but I didn't know how much longer I was going to keep using my old laptop, so it worked out for me at the time.<br /><br />If you keep this charger stationary it may last a lot longer as the cord from the power brick part to the laptop is the one that will fail. After a while I had to wrap the charger cord around the laptop to get the charger to work, and then it finally stopped working all together."
3.0,"Seems to give my celeron CPU a bit too much voltage. I'm not sure if it's an inaccurate reading on the motherboard's part, if the CPU is bad, or what the issue is, but either way it makes me a little nervous to see it getting 1.53 volts when it really should only get like 1.2-1.1."
3.0,"I like this case a lot. But they have not actually planned on a standard ATX power supply. I used a standard PSU with the exhaust fan on top. Boy does this thing heat up. The case is a constant 110 degree F. I can place and hold my hand on it, but it is uncomfortable.<br /><br />I have emailed the manufacture and spoke with Amazon. Of course Amazon is awesome and willing to pay to ship it back. I'm hoping the manufacturer has some info for me in the next few days<br /><br />I am really disappointed as I was very excited for this build. I did cut my self on the 5.25 drive bay, but that's ok, I should have been more careful.<br /><br />3 stars for now, let's see how good customer service is."
3.0,Good quality with incrediblely high price. That's the reality of apple products.
3.0,In my opinion it's difficult to use.
3.0,good product fair price
3.0,great!
3.0,"I am not sure what I had expected but I am not impressed. Yes, the extended batter life is good and I like the new font but these two features hardly justify the cost. I would not recommend upgrading to this version."
3.0,"They sure break easily.  Made cheaply overseas, and they're three dollars apiece?"
3.0,The cords aren't very long. But they work.
3.0,"Was getting about 8-10Mbit/s with my old card, bcm4312 based, which came in my Dell Inspiron 1545. Our Android devices were pulling much closer to the 30Mbit/s that our cable connection provides. Some forums suggested trying a newer card, with some people saying they had good results with Intel, so I tried this one. After some driver issues, I got it to connect to the router (WHR-HP-G300N) as N, but it doesn't use N speeds very long. I can sometimes get 12 MBit but usually it's more like 4. Similar behavior on Ubuntu and Windows 10. Now I find dozens of forum postings with similar results from Intel cards. Will try an Atheros-based card next.  Update: On the Windows side, I had installed the latest drivers but I guess I hadn't rebooted. Today the speeds are more or less OK on Windows, 25-30Mbps. On the Ubuntu side I found that the iwlwifi settings &#34;11n_disable=8 power_level=5&#34; gets me to near 20Mbps... some of the time. Speeds still fluctuate a lot though, and connection speed is pitiful after resume from hibernate."
3.0,"Pretty good for what you would order this for, and you get some uses out of it that you wouldn't have expected. Would recommend to anyone looking for this type of gaming side keyboard. I will say that I think Razer's version is a little more comfortable, and the joystick is way better than this Logitech version. I also like how Razer's has more of a mechanical keyboard feeling to it. However, the LCD screen is half the reason I bought it as I upgraded from my G510s keyboard and missed it. I also think the key setup and ergo design is better on the Logitech.<br /><br />A few cons with the many pros also. The joystick doesn't do volume up. For some reason it does all the other inputs and even volume down. Was hoping to use that as a volume and media control, but couldn't get it setup to how I wanted it because of this. Another complaint is that I have to put a cloth underneath, because for some strange reason the thing the sit level and wobbles standard. Other than these complaints though, would recommend to most people. Almost on par with Razer's, but the pros of this Logitech can't be found on Razer's version either."
3.0,The sticker started to peel of on one corner and its lost its stick. But just be careful putting it on thats all. I'll probably just tape it down.
3.0,"Pretty flimsy, but not bad for the price."
3.0,You will have to do your research on how to use this device.  If you do not it will not work.
3.0,It is smaller than expected. My laptop fit fine but wont fit additional such as charger or headphone.
3.0,"I needed to replace my Kindle Fire, since mine was having issues with the charging port and I was told it would be almost as expensive to fix it as to replace it.  My old Kindle was a 7 inch, but I thought a 6 inch would be just as good, just more pages.  I was wrong.  The print on the 6 inch Kindle is much smaller than the print on the 7 inch.  I wish it had the same size print but with more pages.  If and when I replace this one, it will definitely be at least a 7 inch."
3.0,"Simple wire, and it works."
3.0,Needed the small &#34;guides&#34; to make wiring easier.
3.0,"BE WARNED!<br />This laptop is fast, I didn't buy it for gaming but for work.<br />When 1 Tb HD failed under warranty, the ugly side of ASUS warranty policy came up.<br />ASUS provides shipping label with ground shipping both ways (from FL to CA!!!).<br />They don't provide packaging. They don't backup failed HD. They also bluntly refuse to return failed HD so I could back it up.<br />They accused me numerous time during phone call for dropping and abusing the laptop and made sure that if there was any sign of abuse in the laptop, the warranty would not apply. I had never before dealt with ASUS warranty, but I read some reviews when people got their computers back with scratched screen etc., I decided to take care of HD failure myself.<br />I'm not the biggest fan of HP laptops, but I've nothing but good to say about their warranty department. Return box was at the house next day for overnight shipment. I didn't ask backup, they offered to do it anyways.<br />This was the deal breaker for me with ASUS. I thought I had found a reliable performance machine but horrible customer service is just too much."
3.0,My wife enjoyed it but it is quite large.
3.0,"Quite frankly I was surprised at what this little tablet could do for the price. It's basically a full windows machine with limitations due to the RAM (1 gig) and storage (16 gigs). When it comes to tablets, I prefer iPads and android machines but I needed a windows machine for work because of an application that uses Java. It was an experiment for me and what I have learned is that you would be better going with a machine with 2 gigs of RAM and at least 32 gigs of storage. I got a years worth of Office 365 with this tablet (That is certainly worth it if you are an MS Office user) but I couldn't even install it due to the lack of space on this device. Also, I still have not been able to upgrade it to windows 10. It's supposed to be able to run on this machine but it fails.<br />All in all, it's a great little machine for $80 but next time I will go with the higher specs."
3.0,"Been using a usb wifi adapter. It worked alright. So when i bought this one I thought it would work much better. Works as good as the usb adapter that i bought for $5 dollars. That being said, it work right out of the box and was a easy install."
3.0,Cord that plugs into the laptop is loose and frequently falls out.
3.0,"This is an attractive cover, but my ipad falls out of it once in a while. I have to be careful."
3.0,This seems to run fine. Hard to give it 4 stars until it lasts a year though.
3.0,I thought this would fit my iPhone 6 lifeproof FRE case but it was just a tad too big so I returned it.
3.0,"Vents in back of laptop will get clogged by dust like lint in a dryer. You have the dismantle the entire laptop, including 50 screws and remove pretty much every component to clean it. It's made to not last."
3.0,It's ok I guess I never bought this but I have had good luck with other toshiba products
3.0,"I was able to get a black and white image after downloading the updated drivers. I was unable to get sound from the device.<br /><br />After fiddling with countless possible combinations among the settings I gave up trying to make it work. This device is apparently only PAL friendly, which means that if you're in the Americas or Japan, you're gonna have a bad time getting this to work properly.<br /><br />The image received from the device was however impressively decent considering the price of the capture card and the overall quality of other aspects of the product. If you're in a PAL region, this is definitely a product worth getting if you want good quality images and don't want to spend too much.<br /><br />Here's what the image looks like (obviously in black and white): https://youtu.be/MeE1mHPoQCY<br /><br />And I'll attach a screencap from that video (reflecting admittedly poorer quality, so you might as well watch the video) to this review."
3.0,It. Serves. It. Purpose.
3.0,Had to glue in the magnets.  Doesn't really hold it's &#34;open&#34; position.
3.0,"came to me a bit beaten up, really should have came in a box"
3.0,"The case does not wrap around even with the screen so there's a small amount of the edge of the screen unprotected. When folding the case into an upright stand, it's rather unstable and falls if the table is bumped. Overall I like the color but I will probably order a new different case soon."
3.0,it was between being too big to not being big enough if that makes any sense at all.
3.0,"I purchased my first Kindle about a year ago. Just days before the warranty was up, my Kindle did an update, restarted and died. Amazon Customer Service was easy to work with and my Kindle was replaced. That Kindle was a refurbished one and lasted about three months before it became very unstable. I never knew if it would work or not. I purchased a Samsung Galaxy. I can read my Kindle library and my Nook library. I was unable to read my Nook library on the Kindle.<br /><br />Amazon does honor their warranty and Customer Service works hard to resolve any issues."
3.0,It's decent
3.0,"I recently acquired a couple of kits to upgrade two laptops, a Lenovo Twist and a Toshiba Satellite. The SSD is great, no complaints. But the idea behind a kit is to simplify the installation process, except it wasn’t like that.  In both cases the bundled software didn’t work as expected. The bottom line? This software tries to deal with things at low level, like BIOS configurations.  Instead, I used a free and simple option that worked perfect in both laptops, and everything at Windows O.S. level!  I also recommend to check about some tweaks for SSD if you are upgrading storage in Windows 8.1."
3.0,It's hard to adjust but works. It doesn't fit well if you have your iPad in a protected case. I don't know but others but I want mt expensive ipad in a case for knock over reasons.
3.0,"I am disappointed with it. I had hoped that I could use it effectively with my Dragon Voice Recognition program. It didn't work well-I had to repeat may words and raise my voice and emphasize some words. I liked its feel on me, but had to go back to using my original headset which I don't lie, but it works. I truly wish that the Logitech headset worked  for me with my Dragon.  If there's a way to may it more dictation sensitive let me know"
3.0,The white parts (stoppers) on the bottom are coming off already.
3.0,"I was actually looking for a wrist rest, and because of the way this pad is packaged, and the way it is shown on its homepage, I thought that's what it was. Oh well, at least it was'nt too expensive, and now I have a nice spare mousepad!"
3.0,Very difficult to get used to. Ended up getting a click key version.
3.0,Several problems with this unit. In terms of overall performance it works just good.<br />Touch pad just got broken few months after I bought it. Charger AC cable also got damaged within few days after bought.<br />2 (out of 3) USB ports also gave massive problems while one doesn't work at all the another work at random times.<br />One of the hinge protector got loose finally got removed from it's original position and once it fall from it's bay never fit back. This make the cover close unpaired and display gets a strange way to fit with when closed and open positions.<br />Still LOVE this pc. With all these loses is a great computer.
3.0,"Like it as a touchscreen tablet, but you can't install anything or it will become very slow."
3.0,"I bought my first one and it worked wonderfully, however i bought a second one for my other computer, and it was deffective. The scroll wheel doesn't work. I'd like to think that my second one was just one of the bad ones."
3.0,Cable is ovcasionally rejected by iPhone as unauthorized
3.0,"Quick review! Works well with livesceibw 3. If your hard on ur notebooks (covers get destroyed or damaged) or will be taking your notebook places with you and taking it in and out of the bag this isn't for you. This is because there are no features that increase the durability of the book. But if you plan on note moving this book much(ie keep it stationary on a desk not taking it places it will work) then it should work fine.<br /><br />Indepth Review!<br />Its great works well has all the special elements that are needed for use with the livescribe. Pages are nice quality and no other complaints about problems working with the livescribe 3 pen.<br /><br />BUT the front cover isn't plastic like 5 star notebooks. If you are using at at highschool where it won't going in and out of a bag multiple times a day it should be fine. But the flimsy multi layered cover is crap (it's thinner then the normal paper cardboard back covers on cheap notebooks) and isn't durable. So if you are taking it in and out of a bag multiple times or throwing it in a locker it's going to show wear after the first you. After a less than a week the layers at the edge start coming apart (outer most layers sorta curl up). After two weeks you will most likely see wear by the coil binding.<br />Because of this I would not purchase this again. I'm looking into single subject notebooks that can fit in a portfolio or getting the loose leaf sheets printed and have holes punched in the pages so it fits in those notebooks where u can add and remove pages/tabs/folders. I believ this to be a much better option costs wise and durability wise! Less chance of notes getting destroyed. The other option I'm considering  for next semester is using a single subject in a portfolio and swap the notebooks (but that's not convenient when I have multiple classes in a row.<br /><br />The loose leaf placed in those personalizable notebooks give me many  options . Such the ability to rearrange my notes, add pages where needed, and organize my notes better by sectioning it with dividers and all.<br /><br />However I have looked into ways of protecting this notebook from wear and tear but haven't found many options. What I decided on was contact paper lining the front and back cover this protects the outermost edges but I couldn't figure out a way to protect the holes where the metal binding goes through. I extended the contact paper past the edge to give it a lip for two reasons. First any damage would happen to the contact paper first since that part isn't attached directly onto the book. Second is because some of the pages of the note book were starting to show wear from the pages sliding on the binding. think of how a binders edge is wider then the paper so it protects them or a thick hardcover book. The cover is usually at least a cm larger then the pages so that it provides extra protect from the pages of the cover slides slight to the side. I tried to show how much the actual pages you take notes on are exposed when the cover slightly shift. I also showed how the extra cm I added to the notebook with the contact paper acts to protect the pages. So far it's working. I will update through out the semester with how it's doing."
3.0,"This is the second Arc Mouse I purchased.  The old white one was wonderful till it stopped working after a few years.  This red one however, has a rubbery covering on the bottom, that scratches and comes off easily with normal use,  after a while it looks ugly, and feels gunky.  So I spent a half hour scraping that rubbery covering off, and like it better now."
3.0,Its an alright cable for the money. the cable has a little bit of ghosting but I am still happy with it.
3.0,"Two issues:<br /><br />1.) When first installed, got nothing but BIOS POST beep code indicating no video card found - thought the card was DOA. Further research revealed that the board uses a Pericom bridge chip to nestle a PCI-E graphics implementation onto PCI-legacy board.  There appears to be no on-board BIOS extension ROM to assist this.  Some older BIOS, like my own, Award 1998-vintage 4.51PG version either does see the bridge, or just does not find the graphics hardware behind it, and so does not permit board use in BIOS display, DOS apps, nor Windows install.  The board is/was found & usable as a 2nd video card after Windows XP  startup,  however.<br /><br />2) The 15-pin VGA connector is placed very high on the standard height bracket. Mating plug may not find clearance beneath rolled-steel case opening at slot rear.  If you need the VGA connection, you may choose to hog out case, or bracket connector opening holes to provide additional clearance."
3.0,seems to keep shutting off with Windows 8.1+
3.0,"The mouse itself was quite interesting. The comfort was decent, and the size was on the large side. Sadly, it broke after a few months. I could no longer right click with the mouse."
3.0,works  with Win 8 OS / usb3 but is very extremely warm to the touch when connected & operating.  No information if this is normal or not..
3.0,Part of the corner has broken off after a relatively short amount of time.
3.0,"Softwear freezes repeatedly.  It doesn't interact with other apps. Otherwise, great size."
3.0,"Not horrible but not what I expected based on all the 5 star reviews. I guess I should have noticed that there were only a handful of reviews...basically, kinda cheap with uneven colors from a china plant with poor quality control....but you get what you pay for hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 or 2."
3.0,"I’m taking two stars off because of packaging and construction defects I’ve experienced with this product. It arrived in a box that was damaged (see picture). Although the product inside the box wasn’t damaged, it could not have been known unless the original box was opened and the contents examined. Regardless, a damaged box should have been returned to ASUS and not sold to a customer. The construction of this desktop computer was very poor. The front bezel was warped and not flush with the metal frame (see picture).<br /><br />The defects aside, this ASUS G10AJ is a powerful desktop computer. The 500 Watt power supply is ample for what is provided inside the box, but if you plan on adding and expanding, you might have problems. The 128 GB solid state drive was loaded with junk and didn’t leave room for adding much more. I solved this by doing the Windows 10 upgrade without saving any settings and personal files. All necessary drivers for Windows 10 are available on the ASUS website. This left me with about 3/4 of the SSD as free space. My boot-up time in Windows 10 is less than 30 seconds. No doubt this is because of the SSD. The other hardware specs speak for themselves - Intel i7 quad-core processor, 16 GB ram, 2 TB 7200 rpm hard drive, and Nvidia GTX970 graphics - they are all top quality and add to the overall experience. I ran the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility benchmark and got 1858 Marks, without any overclocking.<br /><br />If you buy this product, make sure you look for the defects I’ve mentioned and report them back to Amazon. However, I am satisfied with the performance of this desktop computer."
3.0,"Fits, solid construction, needs to come with a rubber washer."
3.0,What is the physical dimensions of this chassis? The listed dimension states 24 inch wide which I believe is incorrect.<br />Does it fit a regular 3.5 inch high psi from gigabyte?
3.0,The extender not solve my problem on 2nd floor
3.0,"There are so many laptop coolers avaiable and I could not find any that stand out as the best solution, they all have mixed reviews.  I bought this one because of it's price and above average reviews.  I was disappointed that the reviews did not mention how many degrees the temperature was lowered by using this product, but I am starting to understand why (I will talk about that later).<br /><br />My laptop runs research programs at 100% utilization 24/7/365.  I believe this makes me uniquely qualified to give feedback on devices claiming to cool laptops.  The first product I tried did not help, it actually raised the processor temperature.<br /><br />Before you buy a laptop cooler, the internet has some suggestions that may stop your laptop from overheating:<br />1.  Remove your battery:  If your laptop is plugged in, remove the battery.  The continous charging of the battery produces heat.<br />2.  Reduce your Maximum Processor State to 99% (in advanced power settings).  This really does make a difference in temperature without a noticeable affect on performance.<br />3.  Elevate the laptop so that air can flow under it.  The heat of the laptop will produce a 'chimney' effect and get air to circulate around it.<br />4.  Keep the laptop open while processing.  this sounds like a 'no-brainer' but I needed to be reminded of that.<br /><br />If you follow those steps you will see a decrease in processor temp (I use a free app called CORE TEMP to measure the processor temperatures).  If you don't follow those suggestions and just use this product, you will see a similar decrease in processor temps.  If you do both, you can expect a greater decrease in temps.  I have seen a decrease of 3 to 6 degrees Celsius using this product and the above suggestions.  However, when I tried to change the Maximum Power State back to 100%, the laptop ran at maximum temperature until it overheated again.  In other words, this product did not solve my problem, it was just another tool that helped my laptop run a little cooler.<br /><br />Like I said, this works, but it is not enough on it's own. Maybe being powered by USB is the problem, maybe an AC powered fan is the answer."
3.0,you will get kick off the server because it doesn't meet Xbox standards but it is only once in a while i would say once every night you play maybe twice
3.0,It's decent. The case snaps into place. It had a few spots on it but they came right off when I wiped them. The keyboard cover is a little off but it serves its purpose. And I got a screen protector as well. Those are hard to put on so any bubbles are on me. The only concern with that is that it had a dent in it when I opened the package.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br />This cracked as soon as I put it in my desk drawer the day after I arrived in my new apartment. It didn't hit anything so I have no idea how that happened. And the keyboard cover has been extremely irritating. It wasn't fitted--it was raised--and the keys were all off/shifted. Even the hole for the caps lock light was off so I could never see it when it was on. Maybe mine was just defective but I don't know if I would buy it again.
3.0,"It has a scratch on the screen. The thing is usable, but just not the one you would be happy with..."
3.0,I like it just enough to keep it. I'm not sure what is preventing Logitech from making a full-size keyboard with similar connectivity. I have 3 computers with Bluetooth. I prefer one keyboard that can switch between them like my mouse can. Why can't it be full size?
3.0,"access panel would not seat evenly, really gaudy in person, not good build quality, I disliked it at first sight<br /><br />has a power supply and lots of space, real upside there, just not the case for me"
3.0,"Really, like it as a tablet. As a telephone it is hard to hear. ADVICE: Use bluetooth, apply some type of screen protection, and get a case."
3.0,It handles nice and the battery seems to last a long time but it is not a full size mouse like I expected. The description should be more obvious. It is about 3/4 the size of a normal mouse and my palm almost completely covers it.
3.0,Loves this notebook...but...would not turn on after a couple days...getting a replacement and if I does it again I will get a full refund
3.0,"It's just okay. If you touch the screen while it's in the upright position it falls down. And of course, the white gets dirty fairly quickly."
3.0,"My Passport backed up my Mac laptop files OK, but would not be recognized by my Dell desk top, which was my primary reason for purchasing it, i.e., to transfer my mac files to my Dell."
3.0,Instant plug and play with mac. Does the job but slowly and is incredibly noisy.
3.0,"was okay, liked the slimness of it"
3.0,"I liked the color, pattern and texture of the Dragonpad@ 360 Degrees Rotating Stand.  It worked fine.  The design isn't the best though.  The iPad pops into the case and is held in place by the hard plastic four corners.  The corners wear after use and allow the iPad to fit less securely.  Also the covering comes loose at the corners too.  This was a fine product for the price.  In my opinion, it is not a long term, high quality item."
3.0,i returned item
3.0,"Close to unit the signal is strong and consistent, but as you move away the degradation is quick and substantial."
3.0,It's okay for the price.
3.0,"Good keyboard bad mouse, The keyboard is great mouse is glitchy/laggy I've been trying to fix it."
3.0,Had it for about four months and it was great at first. I take good care of my laptop and I'm not rough with it but the corners of the bottom chipped off making the bottom plate unusable. It happened after about 3-4 months of gentle use. Top plate has held up fine and is in good condition.
3.0,Can't go wrong for the price but now I am not too happy with it.  discharge very quickly max an hour use on my Pavilion dm4
3.0,Could not plug into my computer. Worked ok in my separate multi port device.
3.0,Works well for my setup and allows for full length GPU. The bad this is the paint job is horrendous. It's like a toddler painted it. I worked for a performance auto parts maker when I was younger and this would have neverrrrr passed QA. I don't think I'd pay $70 for it again. A little disappointing seeing as its the center of my home theater setup.
3.0,"I love the color, design, and materials of the case, but there are several very glaring issues I had when installing my parts.<br /><br />First off, the instruction manual provided was very vague, none of the screws are labeled leaving it up to the builder to guess which to use. This can lead to a large amount of stress or even mistakes, especially if this case is used in your first build. Thankfully, with enough prior experience, I was able to assemble the case without any major complications.<br /><br />Next, the space set up for the hard drives confuse me. The way the mounts are designed, you are forced to place your drive SATA facing yourself while building, rather it facing the inside of the case. When plugging in cords to the drives arranged like this, the right side panel is impossible to put back on. The worst part is there's even a large amount of empty space behind the mounting area that could have been used to fit cords had the mounts just been pushed back a bit. To fix this, I was forced to mount my drives all backwards in order to feed my cords to the back side of the case, just so everything could fit. I feel like this was almost the intended way to do it, but not only does the provided manual disagree, the notion is too illogical due to the design of the case.<br /><br />Lastly, I've been having several wonky audio issues with my front headphone jack. Audio will suddenly get very quiet or soft periodically and can be very annoying when trying to listen to music. Tomorrow I am going to attempt to switch from BIOS HD to A97C audio to see if that helps. If anything changes I will update my review accordingly."
3.0,"Looks great, but keeps peeling off aftervwecapplied. It's been on there for a day and on the same day, it started to peel. We even cleaned our console and dried it before we put the sticker on..."
3.0,I found it difficult to install and I continue to have bubbles near the border.
3.0,"DEFINITELY NOT WATERPROOF!  The off gassing is significant.  If I had known it was coming from so far away and take so long, I would not have ordered it."
3.0,"It does the job. I have the new mac book air and its fits, but it doesn't fit great. One of the rubber pads on the bottom is misaligned. For the price it works but it definitely isn't the best."
3.0,This product is ok I have problems with keeping charging my computor like if I move it to a certain spot it will charger but if I move it even a little it will stop charging. But it's OK it does its job sometimes there better ones out there probably
3.0,The keys don't really work when you press on them they won't appear so you have to do it multiple times. I got the wrong charger that wasn't for the key board
3.0,"Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed. To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down. When I attach a mouse it's fine but the touchpad is really annoying. I went through the settings and there isn't a way to fix it. Thinking I received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed. If anyone can help me out on this, that would be great. It's a great laptop, but right now it's annoying to use the touchpad."
3.0,To heavy and not enough time to figure it out yet..will follow up
3.0,Like this though it is not very sturdy
3.0,Most of them have worked well but had a bad one and it costs almost as much to ship back to Diablotek as to purchase a new one.
3.0,"This is a good product to compliment any android streaming device. In my case I purchased the Element Ti4 Quad Core Android TV Box 2GB/16GB/4K S812 Streaming Media Player KODI/XBMC 14.2 Helix & Android 4.4 and the remote that came with it was pretty useless. This unit is lightweight and comes with a rechargeable battery. I just don't know how long the battery will last and where to get replacements when the time comes.  //UPDATE I downgraded to 3-stars because this remote only allows me to use it near my device. If I try to use it 10 feet away, it will not work."
3.0,It's OK - does the job and doesn't fail - but I don't like the fact that it does not indicate how much is on it.  My smaller Lexar has a &#34;scale bar&#34; on the face that indicates how much info is stored.  This one must be plugged in and you must look at the file explorer to see how much is on it.
3.0,"Love the cover, but disappointed that the on/off cover is so hard to use when turning off my tablet."
3.0,"Can't give a full review, as I had to send back my Dell XPS (purchased X where)~"
3.0,We purchased it for our twin 9 year old daughters. It suits their needs for using the internet and was an inexpensive way for them to have their own computer. They are able to play all the online programs required for school and it frees our household computer for us. The only thing that was annoying is that the charger never worked and we had to purchase a new one.
3.0,"Pretty good, I like the color and the texture of the case. However some of the ink on the keyboard cover is gone."
3.0,"For the first couple of days I couldn't access Windows 10,  I was ready to return the laptop, but I sought help from  an expert who after a few hours of work,the Windows 10  icon finally appeared, I was able to keep the machine which works well so far."
3.0,"Works perfectly and charges my phone while attached to the attachment in my car, but while attached my audio set up doesn't recognize the device. I cannot utilize my phone as a music device while using this attachment in my car."
3.0,It didnt last as long as expected.
3.0,Not that great. I bought for my granddaughters as a replacement and not big enough always saying delete out of room.Plus I thought it was all black like there old ones don't care for the white.
3.0,It's working good
3.0,"product arrived in good condition and appeared to be correct.  however, my wife found that this will not fit the Acer CB3-111 c670 that it is automatically suggested as an extra purchase with.<br /><br />returning... and have a disappointed wife."
3.0,"I'll write this here because I couldn't find it while searching the reviews. This unit has NO vertical adjustment if you don't have the same monitor. Both units must slide up and down the mount pole equally. So if you are using two different monitors that hang at different heights you are our of luck.Other than that the price is great and the quality is good. Oh, I also had a bear of a time mounting the pole to my desk as I use a Varidesk and the hang off the top shelf isn't high enough to accommodate the huge eye bolts that they use to tighten the mount."
3.0,this product is ok but not so good
3.0,It's a little &#34;loose.&#34;  I presume but don't know for certain that Evercase markets this one for the Asus Zenbook UX303 13.3 and the same one for other sized laptops around 13-14 inches.
3.0,Wish it was smear proof.
3.0,still trying to determine how well it does the job
3.0,"Looks fancy, so-so fit (definitively NOT snug, as it's gaping on the bottom backside), doesn't appear to provide much protection beyond preventing scratches to the outside of the Chromebook. Very un-impressed."
3.0,Split screened as said for xp. Lags a lot.
3.0,Works. a bit &#34;flimsy&#34;
3.0,"I had really hoped this would help me connect to a xfinity wifi hotspot that is broadcast through multiple thick walls on the same floor.  Unfortunately, though it did SHOW four xfinity wifi hotspots, it would not connect at a strong enough quality.  Essentially, all I could do was download email; pulling up webpages was like the old days of dial up.  When I moved to having only one wall barrier it was fine, so the product does work, it just doesn't grab the signal well enough to improve over my built in laptop wifi card.  Easy to return so it was worth the risk."
3.0,"Not bad, but could easily be a lot better.  There are several quirks that just lower the quality of the Chromebook experience.  For instance, I use a mouse with mine.  Works great that way, except for interference from the touch pad.  The touch pad is at the regular level as the surface of the Chromebook, but the keyboard is recessed below that.  So, when I type, if my hand even slightly brushes the touch pad, the cursor goes off flying to where I DON'T want it.  Sometimes, the accidental touch causes even worse.  Could be solved with a simple hotkey combination to disable the touch pad.  Another annoyance; when I first open the chrome browser, it opens my 3 home screens.  If I close it, when I reopen it again, it opens what IT wants, not what I want.<br /><br />Like I said, &#34;quirks&#34;.  A bit more thought needs to be put into this."
3.0,"It is serviceable, less than expected..."
3.0,Case is okay. Didn't like the shiny rubber that the phone sits in. That looked very cheap and covered the buttons so you had to push a button with your finger nail when needed.<br /><br />Otherwise the case worked fine. Didn't look or feel like leather...it was advertised as PU (polyurethane) leather but it didn't even try to look like fake leather. I sent it back to Amazon and purchased the real leather ACcase. Very happy with that one...and it was even less money then this one.
3.0,"The modem model itself is fine, and was recommended by Comcast. When I called Comcast to swap the MAC address out on my account, they were able to see the modem and even restart it. HOWEVER, I seem to have gotten a modem with a bad network port on it. I had it hard wired directly to my laptop and got no lights, signal, nothing. even did some troubleshooting with Comcast tech support. This is a refurbished model, but it looks like this one is just a lemon. Sending this back to try one that is brand-new instead."
3.0,no good
3.0,"This is a great little keyboard cover, but it warps badly over time.  The area over the space bar is always a little loose and it gets much worse within a couple months.  Great temporary cover, but doesn't work well for more than a few months."
3.0,"I works well enough for a USB Hub. Can be used to charge mobile devices since it has supplemental power supply. However, since every cable plugs into the front, it makes it difficult to manage it as part of my desktop setup. I wish they considered having the power cable and the main USB connection enter the rear of the device - so as to give more space for the hub ports."
3.0,"Died after eight months. I purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift and it died after eight months. I gave it three stars because they was at least willing to fix it under warranty, but I know I'd never buy anything Asus again. I don't care how inexpensive they are because in the end you always get what you pay for (think Walmart)."
3.0,Smaller than I think. The space is quite limited.
3.0,Thank you. It works fine.
3.0,They fit and worked. Direct import items should be clearly marked as such.
3.0,Good card. Loud coil wine above 100 power. Advertised as 4gb when its only 3.5. White led somehow stays on when my pc is off. Noticeable card droop and its brand new.....
3.0,"Like other reviewers, I noticed this drive failing to write properly not long after getting it out of the box.  I bought it b/c i needed to burn 50+ disks (CD) on short notice and also had to provide a SLIM drive to someone whose primary unit lacked an internal optical drive. The product gets good reviews in a lot of places on the web, so I downplayed some of the few complaints I had read.<br /><br />It burned nonstop almost continuously as I worked through my project, which may have contributed to the failures prompting my less-than-stellar rating. Then, I encountered the first &#34;unable to write&#34; (an approx of the message... when retrying, my burn software simply advised inserting a disk, as if it did not see the one inside).  i assumed i had a bad disk, or had used one inadvertently that I had already written to... then the message repeated 3 disks in a row, and i got extremely frustrated.  i returned a lot later to same errors (on another and on the same disks).<br /><br />I returned the next day, and all was peachy keen, until it happened again after a dozen more disks.<br /><br />I finished my project on another more cumbersome setup with another drive, and moved on.<br /><br />The disk has never faulted on READING, although i have probably tried only a dozen or so disks, in contrast to my writing experience.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Not for a similarly large project, no.  For casual use, yes."
3.0,"The product arrived on time and it's working so far.  The charger is not good and gets overheated, and heats the computer so, I bought myself a new charger which is working properly now.  For a used computer, it is doing okay at the moment."
3.0,Cool basic case..<br />Vibrates pretty knarly on a hard durface tho..
3.0,they're uncomfortable on your ears when you wear them for more than 10 minutes
3.0,I love the color and feel of this case.  But... it is not quite what I expected.  I purchased this case for my kindle because it was supposed to have the auto wake sleep feature. It doesn't work.  I have another case that has this feature but due to the arthritis in my hands I need something I can hold on to without making my hands hurt. I really need this feature.
3.0,I bought these because they were cheap and the reviews were pretty good. These are good if your just doing basic things online like maybe skyping or watching videos. For me I was not impressed b/c I do a lot of music based work on the computer and this has me listening to things loudly. So if you intend to be listening to music expect very mediocre bass and lots of distortion if the volume is turned up more than half way. This is why they only cost 13.99 tho. :)
3.0,"Okay. Let me start off by saying that the blue pictured is either incorrect, or they sent me the wrong case. It's not a bad color, but it's not the color I wanted, and I'm disappointed about that. I'm looking for a way to contact Fintie so I can ask them to update their product photo so as to not mislead others. That, on top of the package getting lost, then arriving several days past the estimated delivery date, has me pretty cranky about using it. Now, on to the case itself... You get what you pay for with this case. My paperwhite fits fine, but it feels like a drop will eject the case's occupant instead of protect it. (For obvious reasons, I haven't tested this.) It's not the lightest case I've used, but it feels much lighter than the Amazon-brand case this one resembles. The magnet closure is weak. I'll have to find a way to mod it and make it stronger, but I don't have much faith in its ability to keep shut when my purse is jostled. It's not a bad case though.   Update June 6 2016: The case has grown on me, I guess, because I'm considering buying a second from Fintie. After a slight modification (Elastic to hold the case closed, hahaha) the case has held up to general wear and tear. I'm considering a second for the color change -- still not a fan of the color I received, and I'd like a change."
3.0,"This tablet is just awesome in terms of size, resolution and features, as it's mentioned in other reviews.  However it comes preloaded with an older version of Android and there is no timeline of if or when it will ever be upgraded.  This means you could be putting your financial and online security at risk, as it doesn't contain the fixes and patches that the latest version of Android and other more recent tablet models would have."
3.0,Works well. I just wish it had a clip on it.
3.0,"Design is comfortable. There's not much in the way of customization since you have to cycle through the DPI button, the side buttons can't be programmed and the color lighs are constantly glowing, but it stands out as an affortable semi-pro mouse.<br />EDIT: after 6 months of non-heavy use the wheel became loose and became unusable since the mapping of scrolling was jittery. I started using wheel click to scroll but never got used to it so I gave up the mouse."
3.0,was nice the 2 weeks it worked turned it one one day to use it and the screen came up with only lines. Working on a return with amazon. I do not like that you have to plug in and un plug the key board if the tablet has blue tooth capabilities I would think the key board would as well. I am having them replace it but would not recommend it as it lasted only 2 weeks. When it worked it was nice and worked well.
3.0,"Good method of application, but still left a number of bubbles no matter what I tried.  Can't see them when unit is on.  Has a tendency to retain marks from finger swipes and need to wipe off regularly."
3.0,"I've had this cable for about five months now, and every month I had it, it got slower and the connection got weaker. Just last night it failed and delivered a ping of 240ms and a download speed of 1.2 mbps. I thought my ISP was screwing me over but it was this cable the whole time. The months that it was functioning it out-performed my other Cat6 cables. It has CAT7 specs but poor quality control. I would steer clear and find a certified CAT7 on NewEgg or another website that doesn't just allow any brand to sell their products."
3.0,"Uh, well for the price it's decent. Don't bother making calls with it because the mic isn't good enough for the other person to hear you. Volume on your end is fine, but if they can't hear you - kind of useless. As for the speaker, it's decent enough quality to have around for the occasional use, but it's not super crisp and clear. It's average, so three stars is all it's getting. For the $7 I paid, it's worth it."
3.0,This fit somewhat small just like the pants but it's super cute and the material is high quality
3.0,"a Little small,  I'd preferred it had a 7&#34; screen.  text looks great,  fonts are much easier to read on this than my tablet.  plus the battery lasts much longer. the big plus for this is the battery time.  I charge it once and can read forever it seems.  so that is a big plus.  works great in full sun shine too just like it says  that is a big plus I can use it with out the glare I get on my tablet.  over all nice reader."
3.0,"Quick review: One broke within the first week of being used, the other two work good. ;("
3.0,This keyboard is bulky and loud!
3.0,Love the design.. I feel the placement of the stylus is upside down. Works good though.
3.0,It was too small
3.0,"It is good, but I cannot get volume loud so I never know when I get messages or I cannot use my alarm."
3.0,Case is a great fit but stylis was cheaply made fell apart on the first day
3.0,"While two of the cables received work fine, the third one was defective and does not charge the FitBit. The construction quality of these cables is also not the best. However, they get the job done, and you get enough of them for the price that the occasional defective one slipping through is not that big a deal."
3.0,fits everything and works for what I needed it for. The only thing I question is why there's a fan opening on the bottom and not much open space between the case and the floor for airflow? I ended up turning it upside down. WIll probably upgrade before considering adding a second video card.
3.0,"CANNOT SAY. GOT CANON BY MISTAKE, NEEDED NIKON."
3.0,"I was very disappointed with this stylus.  It obviously doesn't work well through a screen protector, and until that gets fixed, anything else is fairly minor.  I had to press hard for whatever is inside the rubber tip to make contact enough to make a line, and when it did make a line, it was inconsistent with the amount of pressure I was using.  I also tried a light touch, but that didn't even register.  Granted, the reason behind it not working so well is that the screen protector is interfering with the stylus' contact.  I wouldn't leave my iPad without a screen protector, I I certainly can't put it off and on every time I want to write or draw.  The wood does feel good in the hand, but it isn't very ergonomic...I could see my hand, over time, getting tired of the wideness.  I am sure it works as advertised, only not with a screen protector.  So think about it before you buy it.  Using the side of the Pencil was a nice touch, and the eraser was handy; but with the screen protector problem, it is just impractical.  Read all the other reviews before making a judgement, and even give it a try in a store, if you can, to see if it works for you."
3.0,It would work most of the time but found myself un-plugging and plugging back in at least once a week. May have been the electrical outlets in my home but did not work well for me.<br />Returned it and purchased a TP-Link router that I was able to bridge and works great.<br />TP-LINK TL-WR841N Wireless N300 Home Router. you can replace the stock firmware with dd-wrt and get so many more features.
3.0,So far it's works good
3.0,"Within the first use, the sleeve of the USB slid off. It is somewhat cheaply made."
3.0,"I have been using these cables for 2 years now. At first, I would only need to buy a new replacement cable every 10-12 months. Just recently in June 2015 I purchased a replacement, but by August 2015, a mere two months, it was malfunctioning. My issue with the cables is the very common need to keep the cable at certain angle to get it to work, but it had never happened in just two months before. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me a free replacement, which I appreciated, but the problem was that the replacement was worse than the one I had complained about, needing an even more extreme angle of the cable to work. At this point I have just decided to switch to a different brand of charging cable.<br /><br />So overall:<br />~Points for being a usually very durable cable with good teeth on the micro usb that usually lasted me 10-12 months<br />~Points for the prompt customer service in getting me a replacement<br />~Reduction for the cable that was malfunctioning within 2 months and the replacement working even less"
3.0,It does not have the battery life as advertised. Also the touch pad is awful.
3.0,"Pros: mostly: super light.  also: functional, designed specifically for sp3<br />Cons:<br />1. Overpriced and, honestly, should come included with the pro series like the pen comes with the pro series.  In my personal opinion, you can't call it a laptop without a keyboard...<br />2. NO PRINT SCREEN!  This is a huge thing for me.  Sure you can take a screen shot that will then save to your screen shots folder that you can then attach to send someone, but that's a bagillion more steps (yes that's an exaggeration) than &#34;alt+prt sc&#34; then &#34;ctrl+v&#34;.  You can also do something with the pen to make it appear in OneNote, but again, it's NOT the same.<br />3.  Material<br />  3a. Whoever designed this keyboard has clearly NEVER OWNED A PET.  It's basically a pet hair magnet.<br />  3b. Gets dirty and dingy super fast.  I've had it less than a week and it's already collecting dust and dirt on the bottom (I got the purple, thinking that it would do better hiding dirt and stains than the cyan...not so much with the dirt, might still do better with the stains).  From what I've been able to find during a search (somewhere in between brief and intensive) for something that protects the type cover and still allows full functionality of the kickstand, is that such a thing doesn't exist.<br />  3c. The edges seem really destructible.  They haven't frayed, split, or separated yet (again I've had it less than a week); however, I see this a distinct possibility.<br />4. There is nothing on the keyboard indicating that there's anyway to use the keyboard to change the screen brightness.  The buttons that look like that will make a difference actually change the key backlighting.  Took me forever (and a friend looking it up) to figure out that Fn+Del or Backspace changes screen brightness.<br />5.  Personal dislike of how the Fn keys are set up.  Factory default is Fn lock. So you press any of the F1-12 buttons and it does the Fn task, not the F1-12 task. Example: F8 performs search without having to hit the Fn button. That's all fine and good, excect that in order to use the key command alt+F4, you have to first hit/hold the Fn key (and because the Fn key is on the right side of the keyboard and my hands are small, that means that I can't close a window using the keyboard with only one hand). So I finally figured out how to toggle that off (hold Fn and hit caps), but then realized that, because the home/end/pgup/pgdn are F9-12, I'd have to then us the Fn key in order to use any of those.<br /><br />There are a couple other things that I prefer about my laptop keyboard.  But I recognize that they'd be difficult to accomplish with such a compact keyboard and can therefore concede those items."
3.0,"Does not work with windows 10 as of today August 29 2015.  Since Windows 10 literally came out about a month ago, there is still time for Asus to develop the driver.  I will hold on to the card for another month or so, but if Asus fails to deliver a driver in a timely manner I will return the product and buy from another company.  This is the website that I used to look for the drivers: [...]_Cards_and_DigitaltoAnalog_Converters/Xonar_DG/HelpDesk_Download/"
3.0,"It fit &#34;okay&#34; there was nothing special about it. Actually my son refused to touch his tablet for about 2 weeks because he said &#34;it stinks&#34; from the smell of new rubber. The smell was pretty strong and took a while to go away, but obviously that doesn't affect the performance of the product."
3.0,"The cable works fine, for the most part. However, the glue holding the magnet in place wasn't too strong, and the magnet came loose. This gives me pause and I don't entirely trust the cable. However, once I pushed the magnet back in, it's worked pretty consistently."
3.0,"This mobo does its job. I got this installed by another site in a custom gaming pc for a decent price. After about a month, the 8 usb ports (case usb included) I have available, only four work and they're only usb 2.0 and of those four, three works consistantly without having to almost constantly replug my peripherals til they start working. Usb ports on the case are completely dead. If you're getting this mobo for the usb 3.0 ports, spend the extra money and get a better one."
3.0,"It was worth the price, but died so easily :/"
3.0,"I bought this for my MacBook Pro, and it fits but it's got an extra 2 inches on the side and inch on the top, so the laptop kinda slides around.  I ended up replacing this with one that fits better.  I don't recommend this product if you have a MacBook Pro.  I could see for bulky PC laptop's this would work though."
3.0,It's ok but the bright blue color is a bit distracting and doesn't make a deal with the device.
3.0,Glad we bought it as recommended - but really should be included with the radio
3.0,"Almost everything about this speaker seems quite good. 3 stars because I just received this today, folded up the charging port flap and charged it. When I try to snap the flap back where it belongs it doesn't stay down. Looks like the rubber is torn where it is supposed to fold. I can't see how this won't happen to every one of them in time, making it not waterproof anymore. Don't know if it was like this before or if it happened the one time I folded it up but not very happy."
3.0,it broke really easy😢
3.0,"These drives are good for the price, but SUPER SLOW."
3.0,Love the feel of it in my hand. I love the interface with paper 53 and was pleasantly surprised how well it draws given the big tip. I also like the ability to shade. So if it is so good why three stars?<br />The mushy feel of the tip bugs me some but in the end lack of durability was the biggest issue. I have had my pencil just over three months. I keep it in the tube it came in when I carry it. I draw with it and take visual notes but not on a daily basis.. And today I had to replace the tip. Other reviewers had mentioned this and now I have first hand experience. Given the price I expect the tip to last longer than three months of casual use. Yes I know they give you two tips but that means in another 3 months I will still have to spend more money to buy one.<br /><br />Love the concept just needs more durability
3.0,"I buy two incase one did work, I was right out of two only one work so I don't have to pay for return shipment."
3.0,Met expectations but quite noisy.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Aesthetics are on point<br />Fits a larger hand (I wear a LG-XL glove)<br />Extensive customization options for performance<br /><br />Cons:<br />One of the side buttons doesn't work properly*<br /><br />*This is merely a flaw in this particular mouse. As I try to adjust the volume on my computer by using the 'Easy-Shift' + Scroll wheel, the button won't respond most of the time"
3.0,"Didn't check closely enough to see the dimensions. My fault, but this mousepad is HUGE!"
3.0,too low of a profile for my taste..lower than it looks..and the pads on bottom are not the greatest..tracks roughly...otherwise it's good.
3.0,"I bought three of these, 2 of them work, one doesn't. The ones that work are fine."
3.0,"They were not new, quite obviously used, but they got the job done"
3.0,Certainly didn't blow me away.  The software is lacking in many areas and the built-in microphone is disappointing.  If I bought it again I'd by the cheaper version with just the sound card.
3.0,Collects a lot of dust--have to pull it off to use on my KindleFire--good protection though
3.0,Thin cover for your mini ipad - feels like the cover of a hardback book.  The pro is that it's very thin and won't make your ipad bulky but the one thing I didn't like is that you have to snap it slightly out of the cover in order to make it horizontal which isn't very convenient.  ipad will turn on automatically when you open the cover.  Note that the cover does not magnetically stick to the ipad nor does it have a strap so it may not be that secure if your ipad will be roughing it.
3.0,"Very cool, but HEAVY (for a usb stick). If you're using it in the car, it'll probably work it's way out of the slot"
3.0,One quit working a week after I started using it.  The other two seem to work just fine.
3.0,The battery don't work
3.0,"Nice design but the interior stiching is not done well, so be carful when taking out the &#34;removable&#34; padding. The Velcro will pull out the stitching immediately. Mine ripped out the first time. The zippers could be higher quality. Wish I could give a better review, I like the look and design."
3.0,"The price of the USB drive is significantly higher than that of a typical USB drive. The reason is that it's supposed to provide extra functionality for people who want that sort of thing. The concept is rather cool: you have a thumb drive onto which you can dump a bunch of files, and access said files from your computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc. And, rather than trying to set up the thing so that it shares through the network, you can just join the USB drive's own network and get things moving.<br /><br />In theory, this is pretty awesome. In practice, it's not. I couldn't get the wifi sharing to work. I joined the SanDisk wifi network. I installed the app on my iDevice. Nothing. The app pulls up nothing at all. I updated the firmware. Nothing. I turned off the power, and plugged it in to charge all night. Nothing. It's rather frustrating when the main reason for buying this drive over others does nothing for you.<br /><br />The reason it's not a 1-star is because the data transfer speeds are satisfactory, and for all it's got on board, it's relatively comparably sized to a typical USB drive."
3.0,Fan works great cooling laptop. Stand has many variations but is a little flimsy.
3.0,It does not have any page Turning  buttons like my old one  where can I get one like that one?
3.0,Fyi my pc has bsod alot since i got these a few months back. I dint think of returning them becouse i dint think it happened enough but oh boy was I wrong. I shoulda stuck with my old RAM and not look for bargain stuff. I cant say 100 percent but ive reasearched the Bsod NS Hd mem dumps and 80 % have been RAM issues. Only thing that changed was the RAM.Been using my old ram for close to two maybe three months not a single BSOD. done goofed up
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with this product; my argument is with Apple that they can't make a decent long lasting power cord when they make such great computers?  Their cords tend to break right at the magnet connector, so I routinely put electrician tape in this spot to get a little longer life."
3.0,"The screen  clarity is great for my needs.  The shape is a tad too rectangular for my taste but that's just a matter of me getting used to another model. Would actually give more stars but the battery life sucks tremendously.  On my old tablet,  I could get a solid 6-8 hours on it off continue use.  This one only gives me 3. So on that note alone,  I'm not too thrilled about the product."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter and she likes it.
3.0,"I found this fan to be too noisy even at low RPMs so I ended up returning it. Not sure if mine was defective or what, but it definitely was not silent. It's not terrible if you want an inexpensive fan and don't mind a little noise. But I recommend paying a little more and getting something else. I bought a Cougar Vortex PWM CF-V12HPB and it seems to be a better buy for 50% more money."
3.0,"I bought this so I could read while walking on the treadmill.  It certainly works better than a book but it's way too small which means I have to run my finger across it every few seconds to turn the page because I need the font fairly large to see properly.  I also wish it had a handheld wireless page turner/clicker.<br /><br />Used normally, I like it.  Battery lasts a long time.  Works great in the dark or light of day.  Quite a few library books available for Kindle.<br /><br />I think I'd prefer a pair of special glasses or goggles that had book images projected on them which would allow hands-free operation."
3.0,Takes adequate photos for photo ID on my patient's medical charts. Difficult to attach to an iMac so we hand hold it. It needs a more universal bracket. Wide angle lens makes the nose appear larger. Big problem now is it does not operate when I upgraded my medical soft ware recently & will check with the software support. It's cheap enough that I could replace but will need to know if a new one will work.
3.0,"The charger is fine.  It works as advertised, charging my Venue 11 Pro 7130 tablet at roughly the same speed as the original Dell charger, but you get you pay for.  I knocked a couple of stars because:<br /><br />1. Plug is not folding and cord is not removable. I use this charger at home and carry the original one with me when I travel.<br />2. Unlike the original, this charger does not charge other (5V) micro-USB devices.  Or, at least it didn't charge any that I tried.<br />3. Micro-USB connector's fit leaves much to be desired.  It takes more force to plug and unplug it than I would prefer."
3.0,good product
3.0,great case but was bummed by the color when it arrived. i love fuchsia but this case came as a maroon color and not as advertised. i was originally intending on purchasing black and i should have stuck with that choice instead.
3.0,"Very rugged, but kind of klunky.  The plastic screen cover doesn't fit flat and has an annoying gloss to it.  The biggest problem is that I can't seem to get bluetooth connections with the case on."
3.0,Seems ok ! You get what you pay for. Lol
3.0,"Record audio level is not as strong as I think it should be.<br />Adequate, comes to mind."
3.0,"Hi dear, it was a great experience and a lot more than a dream come true. I appreciate the offer."
3.0,fine
3.0,It's good quality but wasn't quite what I was looking for so returned
3.0,"it needs more storage, kids like lots of games."
3.0,They function as they are described but the springs hold onto your head too tightly and unless you have a real skinny head it makes them very uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time ..
3.0,It felt like pretty good quality but a seam came apart after a few weeks at the bottom of the front pocket. It doesn't affect the use at all but it is a blemish.
3.0,"I just went out and got the RT87R router and i have been trying to set this up and have a been having a lot of trouble with the customer care. The router itself the range and speeds are great as long as its connected. But i have been noticing that my phone keeps dropping off the 2.4Ghz. I called the customer care which is absolutely terrible!! very rude agent to the extent she even hung up on me. I had to call back to report her to their floor supervisor. I was first told that i need to change the auth method and encryption on both 2.4 and 5 G then was asked to change the control channel on both 2.4 and 5 G. but still no luck. The 5g had totally stopped working and when i changed it back to auto the 5G started working again. Now I have the 2.4 on channel 6 and still i notice that i get dropped the 2.4g<br /><br />I think this is a great router but Asus needs to have their reps know what they are doing or have it properly documented. For me this is mostly a return, i still have 12 days left, so i'd probably keep it for a bit to see how many times i keep getting bumped off the 2.4G.."
3.0,Good enough for the price. Time to time black out for no reason. But able to recover it.
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected. I must not have studied it enough before purchase. I did not realize that you have to separate the case to put it in landscape view, then do it again to put it back together to close. I must have confused this one with the ones you simply turn. Corners are covered well with this case and you can access all your buttons and tabs easily. It's stitched well and seems sturdy. I really like the color.  So for these reasons...&#34;it's okay....&#34;"
3.0,"Works great for dash cameras and stuff like that but is terrible or everything else even if you just want to put 10 songs on it, it takes forever."
3.0,Really hard to remove it once it's on.
3.0,Not that bad.
3.0,"Works, and fits in narrow or tight spots. Moves decent air for it's depth I guess, but it wasn't as strong as I expected for static pressure. Just kind of underwhelming. Quiet but not silent. One of the two I ordered has a slight grinding noise like there's microscopic gravel in the bearing, so I'll see how long it lasts.<br /><br />This fan is touted as being for cpu coolers and RADIATORS, but doesn't come with the required 3/4&#34; '6-32' screws with M4 flat washers that you will need for use on a radiator. You'll have to find these yourself at a hardware store. For a $20 fan, these should have been included.<br /><br />Will likely purchase Scythe next time for less money."
3.0,It does its job as a replacement battery. Only lasts at most about an hour without charging if labtop is on power saving mode. Battery dies when at 22 percent. So really I only have about a 30-45 minute timeframe with this battery. Can't complain though. You get what you pay for.
3.0,so so
3.0,"I am dissapointed because of the poor microphone they put into this laptop. Voice quality on videocalls like Skype sound damped and poor, people complain all the time. I have tried different things but its still unacceptable. The rest works."
3.0,Okay product...
3.0,"I love it! !!  BUT the pad fits too small on the case and the back looks like it was created for sn ipad. Other than that, I love it!"
3.0,"It's so pretty but not quality. Right away it started to crack. Now, about 8 months in and with very delicate care, it continues to crack. I would still say it is worth the buy, but don't think it will last forever."
3.0,Very limited number of apps. Reading books it's ok but not a great tablet for all of the choices available on other devices.
3.0,Trouble with standing up in the notch.
3.0,all right the battery only lasts 30 minutes
3.0,"The case doesn't stay flat on the iPad when closed and not used. It goes up a little bit which is kind of annoying.The case isn't that clean either when delivered, as if a person who just ate chips, without washing their hands, touched it and the oily mark wouldn't be erased."
3.0,Works great with windows and windows phone.  Too bad the keys were laid out for apple.
3.0,Love kindles...can't turn off touch screen on this one and unintentionally flip between pages a lot.  Automatic lighting is cool.
3.0,"Well even though it is exactly the same part number as the old dvd it doesn't fit, physically different.  I wonder if the old one was modified and this is entirely the wrong part. Eventually the old DVD failed entirely. I tool this to the basement and modified the sheet metal to match the other also modified DVD and installed it. It is not a perfect match still but it plugs in and works. Up to 3 stars from 2 since I shouldn't have to modify a part that was supposedly made for the computer."
3.0,"this item worked for about a year, beautifully, before the end of the chord connected to the box-looking part began to get a faulty connection. Now all it does is click. This may be an issue of using the charger with an HP computer, but now the thing is useless."
3.0,"Had to return - like another reviewer, colors did not seem accurate (everything with BenQ always appears too orange.) Would not recommend for Photoshop or other graphics work."
3.0,"Installation is a bit lengthy for a wifi adapter, signal strength is good but not great."
3.0,"Ya get whatcha pay for!<br /><br />Small speakers (good for a small desk), and small sound. Mind you, I've been used to HK's Sound Sticks III, but they died after many, many years. I'm a little &#34;spoiled,&#34; I guess.<br />;-)"
3.0,"Lightweight foam, not the harder plastic I was expecting. Keeps it easy for the kid but I just know the charge port &#34;gate&#34; will wear out within the year. Plus side--it's big and bright orange. Thing doesn't get lost. Wouldn't rely on this for safety for a lot of out-of-the-house use."
3.0,interfers with wifi signal
3.0,I received the battery quickly enough but it keeps falling out of the laptop. No more mobile computer.
3.0,"the usb drive functions at full speed, but if you ever have an issue and need to reformat the disk, it loses its speed. There must be some some sort of firmware installed on the drive that keeps it running fast."
3.0,it does have a chemical smell to it. hopefully it goes away. It is a good basic case though.
3.0,These do not last wear out quickly.
3.0,"THESE ARE NOT MADE OUT OF WOOD.  I think the name of this product is completely mis-leading, although the speakers do work well.  They are plastic speakers with a wood-looking sticker used to cover the sides.  Very disappointing.  False advertising!  But, as I said, the speakers do work well."
3.0,Package came really wrinkled
3.0,only complaint is the USB wont charge my phone or  books
3.0,The fan itself is great but mounting kit definitely not! The fan has plastic mounting kit on the fan case so the screw might be the broke the plastic hole (which happened to me) and you definitely have to be careful while installing this. Corsair should have change that plastic hole!
3.0,"cord is TOO short - okay if you plug is on your desk, but if on the floor or wall this will be frustrating short.  Mine lasted about 2 years then the plug went bad but for ~ 7 bucks it was worth it"
3.0,"Its alright but I wasn't excited with hit.  Didn't really stand the test of time and the folds in the bottom are so shallow the tablet keeps popping out of it when you touch it which, if you think about it, is the purpose of a tablet over a laptop.  Additionally, I have to take it out of the case if I want to use my earbuds because the left clip that holds it on covers the audio out hole.  All in all not bad but I'd research more before spending on this one."
3.0,"Screen is not real sharp,  and hard to look at."
3.0,"Does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it blocks the SATA port of the Banana Pi M1+ board, and I wasn't able to modify this adapter to remedy the problem, so I was forced to buy a different style dongle."
3.0,"Great product worked pretty good for 2 years 10 months, is bought it on Aug 17, 2015 died on June 24, 2017. Kinda disappointed it's superposed to last  1000 cycles, it only lasted 141."
3.0,"It has feature you don't really need, like controls for the fans which aren't even strong, and my laptop kept sliding off. Only use when on a table. I got it for my mother and it's still working and i know she never turns it off, so this cooling fan is of good quality."
3.0,"its okay but not what l needed, l need more GB and unfortunately l cannot update to Windows 10 from XP..also l can't play my games on Facebook, it is not fast enough, the games barely load and than they crash...its just not what l had hoped it would be, its okay to check my Emails and read the Reel on Facebook but thats pretty much it..."
3.0,does what it should
3.0,"Could this go with my computer build, i mainly want it to cool down my graphics card, and if it doesn't go for it can you point me in the right direction, would be appreciated, here's the specs: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/zFr73C"
3.0,The product was deliverd as per schedule.  Thats definitely  a innovative thought byt i dont feel that this product is worth of  replacing the regular hand mouse. As the red pointer blinks all the time it will be quite disturbing to use .i can give 3 ating because it is cheap and a innovative thought
3.0,"I want to like this sso uch but the keyboard really does suck (like so many complain bout online) . Eveerything eelse is so perfect, it's a shame to be ruined by one failed feature. At the price I paid, it's worth it to me to keep it but wow it's annoying. I`vee left the mistakes so you can see the resultss. I`m also a very deliberate hunt-and-peck typit so the mistakes are not due to not pressing hard enough or inaccuracy. And yes the repeat rate is the slowest i gets. Thiss ssimply repeats letters and misses them at random.  The good news - I received the Microsoft Signature edition, brand new sealed. This was NOT a refurb. (from DeaalFisher) I would guess they are trying to clear these out due to known keyboard issues."
3.0,well just got it but so far so good
3.0,"It works fine, but it's kind of narrow and not very comfortable to type on (for me, at least). Decent for the price."
3.0,This fits my daughter's laptop but I am not completely satisfied. The bag is a bit softer than I would prefer and the charge cord bulges through neoprene. It is fine for the price I paid.
3.0,Good clarity and stuff. Not comfortable (at least for someone who wears glasses).
3.0,"Product is a much brighter orange than it appears in the photo. However, the materials are of good quality for the price and it will serve its purpose."
3.0,MiniUSB did not work with Motorola Razr phone
3.0,The directions I got with this case is for an Ipad.  I checked online what other people posted about this product and most people loved it.<br />I feel that this item is not what I can really use and may send it back.
3.0,Shipped quickly and is a nice fit. The only problem I have is that the magnetic keyboard doesn't hold in place well at all.
3.0,Noice.
3.0,"At first this microphone seemed to work great. My friends could hear me just fine while gaming and skyping. However; after a month or so of use my friends stared complaining to me about static on the line and sudden increases and decreases in the microphone sensitivity. Usually that was rectified by simply unplugging and plugging the mic back in. After a while though the problem not only persisted but became worse, until one day my friend an I were playing Dota 2 together and he said my mic sensitivity suddenly became extremely and deafeningly loud. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and could never get it to work again after that. It was officially dead.<br /><br />pros: great price. very sleek and easy to use. Fits almost anywhere on my desktop without being in the way. Also has a 9 foot cord which can be extremely convenient if you need to finagle and snake it around your desk for positioning and it can be easily coiled up when not needed.<br /><br />cons: moderate sound quality and it died too quickly"
3.0,"I'm a former gamer but still a PC power user at work and home, and I really rely on a good mouse to be effective.  Something about Logitech Sensitivity just doesn't cut it for me.  I can't put my finger on it but I gave this mouse an honest chance for over 1 month, and I would still misclick things because the mouse is just unpredictable.  Also it's larger than most wireless mice, but it's still not big enough for a large hand.  The left-hand friendly design means it only has a place for 4 fingers, so your pinky will still drag or feel squished on this mouse.  Also one thing that is REALLY annoying is if you leave it idle (ie if you switch between keyboard and mouse frequently) there is a delay when you go back to move it, and it always makes the first click a misclick.<br />My advice, if you can deal with Logitech quality already, you're probly fine, but don't expect it to work for you otherwise."
3.0,Does' it's job but chord is too short
3.0,The 8 Pin Lightning part cannot work with the LifeProof case for iPhone 6 so I bought this in vain. I'm stuck with a short cord.
3.0,Bubbles impossible to remove.
3.0,"It was easy to place the top cover but the ones inside the computer are not. It would be much better if each piece was separate for the inside of the computer, but still with a few attempts it worked! ' This is my second decal from decalrus, the colors were much better on the first one. I would give it a 5 if the colors weren't so dark compared to the picture, if shipping was faster, and if it was easier to install the inside decals. But overall the designs get high compliments! '"
3.0,It charges a Samsung S6 about 75% as fast as OEM Samsung adaptive fast charger.
3.0,The product is ok.  I had a little bit of a problem getting it to fit just right over the laptop lid. I had to cut around the edges to get a proper fit.  I had this for a few months now and its holding up well so far.
3.0,I like it. Thanks
3.0,This sleeve fits just about any laptop - I had no trouble getting my Gateway with a 14&#34; screen to fit in it with room to spare.  I think I could also slide a pad of paper in too.  Neoprene should provide protection against light rain but I would not go so far as to say this is waterproof.  The external padding provides some protection against bumps and scratches but will not help much against really rough treatment.
3.0,"It's okay. I wanted an all shiny clear case and these have a matte frost part on about half of the back. Otherwise, everything works well. The buttons are easy to press. Easy to put on and take off but it's not loose."
3.0,"Marks from natural oils on hands/fingers are almost impossible to clean off! I ended up just taking off the top part and keeping the bottom on for safety. I've had this for about a year and little pieces have broken off making the cover slide around. The sticky things on the bottom have all fallen off, which is very inconvenient with such a slippery lightweight computer. I gave this 3 stars because it might just be this particular color that smudges so easily. That's the worst part for me.<br />Nice color, I like how the light shines thru, nice soft to the touch texture, although easily smudged. Not very durable."
3.0,doesn't seem to pick up sound all that great
3.0,"There always have some drive problem which make me have to re-install the drive again and again, but at least, it works, indeed."
3.0,A little bite heavy
3.0,"The product protects the ipad nicely.  I hadn't considered its propping angle but having just one angle now instead of the 3 I had before I miss that option.  Although this one angle is more secure than the three I had before, so its a tradeoff you have to consider."
3.0,This product was suggested with the LaCie external hard drive i purchased. Case was slightly too small to it does not zip all the way. Quality product just be careful with product dimensions.
3.0,"it has worked for my purpose, it lasted about around a year."
3.0,good but there are better products
3.0,Products OK
3.0,"hated the brackets to mount the fan, it broke down on the very first day."
3.0,"Had to return this case. While it is advertised to fit iPad mini and iPad mini with Retina, it doesn't actually fit the Retina version and close as the Retina version is a tad bit thicker. Because of this, I couldn't get the case to close all the way around the ipad mini, making the case useless. I provided 3 stars though because it was a light weight case and contained everything advertised. It was also nicely packaged and arrived quickly. Only downfall is the fact that it didn't fit like it advertised. It was easily returned also, another reason to love Amazon."
3.0,"Its okay, more like a toy than a laptop.  One of the problems is that the screen is too small and have to keep going back and forth to read whatever is one the screen."
3.0,"SD card & CF card ports work well. However, usb ports do not. Only reads my usb 3.0 hard drive & not my usb 2.0 hard drive. Not as advertised. Everything else works just fine."
3.0,Can't swipe up to pull up the menu to adjust brightness. Definitely a design flaw. Besides that it works as advertised.
3.0,Flimsy
3.0,it was ok but not to convenient to use
3.0,"I think it's okay.  I couldn't get my device to talk to the computer, but it might be my driver.  Not sure."
3.0,don't work very well with the screen protective sheeting
3.0,"It works it is a bit of a hassle with the disc, but i used on my laptop and i went from 2 bars to a full 5 the only problem is that it will keep randomly stop working and wont work again for a couple minutes besides that it is a good product i would recommend something else.  Another thing is it says it is $9.47, what i don't understand is why is was charged $20.48 for it.  i only bought and received one."
3.0,The fan itself is great but mounting kit definitely not! The fan has plastic mounting kit on the fan case so the screw might be the broke the plastic hole (which happened to me) and you definitely have to be careful while installing this. Corsair should have change that plastic hole!
3.0,bien
3.0,It's ok. It's a lil slower than I expected.
3.0,"When I can get it plugged in, they work fine. The design is super annoying. The slider switch that pushes out the computer usb plug on one side and the android plug on the other snaps into a little spot for three places (usb one way, middle, and phone usb the other way). But the usb doesn't stay out well. Half the time when I try to plug it into a computer, the usb plug instead slides back into the middle. I can sometimes hold the button so the usb stays out, but sometimes space restrains that from working well.<br /><br />I bought a few, but since it's been such a frustration, I've stopped using them. Every single one had this issue."
3.0,"Does not fit the 7140 perfect, but it is still useful."
3.0,Worked great for a month then just quit but they have me a full refund
3.0,"To start off with you probably shouldn't set your expecations to high in this sound speaker as it may not actually be what you expect.<br /><br />In my case i just wanted something simple which these speakers seem to do the job but they are not any better than the previous speakers i was using ( some cheap $10 sony ones) so i cannot with good sense advise these unless you want to save space.<br /><br />Speaking about space this is exactly why i bought them to take out the other speakers i had and mount this unit to the desktop monitor. I actually bought the one that came with the external power however it sound bar gets sufficient power from the monitor without the need of the external power so i never bothered using it.<br /><br />There is a light in the middle of this unit when you turn on the speaker this can either be a good or bad thing. For me its actually a bad feature since it bugs the heck out of me having to look at the light while i am using my monitor i had to get electrical tape to cover it because it was so distracting when i would browse on my dell monitor.<br /><br />The quality of the soundbar is low mediocre at best , it does go pretty loud for its size but the sound starts  breaking up more once you crank it really loud.<br /><br />If anything there is mostly intended for low usage and space saving , i occasionally have hooked it up as another audio streamer for a phone or mp3 using its external power however its isn't really convenient as its too large to carry around than a mini speaker."
3.0,"Has lasted about a year so far- It's still working for the moment, but starting to flake out unless the cord is jiggled.  I've had my laptop battery die several times now, because the power brick will just cut off randomly.<br /><br />The biggest thing about this for me is that this thing is completely unshielded.  No matter what power you plug it into- wall AC, battery backup, or otherwise, it will send harsh static/AC power fluctuating noises through your speakers.  This is not a 'ground loop' issue- the noise comes from the power brick itself.<br /><br />I use my laptop to record audio, so this is a deal-breaker for me.  If you are doing anything with audio on your laptop, I highly suggest spending the extra money on the ASUS original power brick.  That's what I'm about to do & keep this as a backup until it dies, which I'm expecting to happen soon."
3.0,"Strange cover, weird leather rubber combo, the old Keyboard model covers with the draw string and soft interior were way better. A piece of the rubber in the corner ripped off like in the first week and the outside scratches easy."
3.0,"It fits, but not perfectly, the bottom part doesn't click."
3.0,the metal hook fell apart
3.0,"Probably used one, but it's ok!<br />Thanks"
3.0,"Did not complete protect my iPad.  Got this because my then 2 year old enjoyed playing her puzzle games on it but was just a bit aggressive with her selections on the screen.  iPad screen still managed to crack, unsure if it was from a drop impact or what but still got damaged."
3.0,Laptop worked great the first few days about an hour a day then would no longer hold a charge. Works fine if plugged in but portability was the whole idea of getting a laptop. Extremely disappointed. Passed it on and bought a new laptop not a refurbished one.
3.0,"All in all a great keyboard but about two months after use the microUSB charging port started coming loose. I've had this problem with Logitech rechargable headphones before.<br /><br />The microUSB female port is this tiny piece of metal soldered onto a board with 5 tiny wires, these things come loose after time through wear, constant plugging and unplugging. Sure, there are videos of people fixing this with solder so I purchased a soldering iron and tried it, but the inner wires ripped out too deep and I couldn't get the solder to adhere.<br /><br />I'm under the impression that Logitech just sucks at making sturdy rechargable ports, I've owned an android phone for ~4 years and the port on that wears out nowhere near as much this thing did. Once this thing breaks off your product is dead.<br /><br />I love Logitech, they make great products. But, consider buying wired/USB or battery replaceable keyboards."
3.0,It was just as the one in the pic. I love the color I just wish fit a little bit tier from the bottom part other than that it's a good product
3.0,no comment
3.0,Nothing spectacular. It does the job.
3.0,My ears are not large and the headphones fit me pretty well.. The two problems I have with the headphones are that they hurt my hears and the sound is not great. The only reason why its not 2 stars is because they were somewhat inexpensive
3.0,i returned item
3.0,"Beautiful case. Very disappointed that the auto sleep/wake function did not work. We are used to using the auto sleep/wake feature on our iPads, so it was a no brainer that this was a feature we were looking for in a new case. I am reluctant to return it because we really like the cover, but we have to have this feature.  Maybe we just ended up with one that was not made properly for it to line up with the iPad. At any rate, we have to keep searching and return this."
3.0,"The eyes don't light up. Not necessary, but I thought it would be cool and it did influence my decision to purchase this product. So I was disappointed, but the product works, so it is serving its purpose, unlike the other USB drive that I ordered from the same company."
3.0,"I liked my Tab 3 a little bit better.  But the Samsung customer service was the most ridiculous experience of my life.  I never thought any company could have worse customer service than Apple, I was wrong.  Which is very unfortunate, because I likely will never purchase a Samsung again, time to start looking elsewhere.  But as far as this particular unit goes, it works, I'm glad I didn't buy it brand new.  Seller was supportive.  I just question my future with Samsung products in general."
3.0,I was expecting ore protection for the Ipad. Ther is none. It is clamped onto the keyboard.The keyboard works very well.
3.0,"I ordered this for my laptop because my original battery could barely hold a charge for an hour. When i first bought this as a replacement it reeked of chemical smells, which made me hesitant to use it. However, my bf assured me that the smell was probably just cleaning solution residue left on the battery. I popped the battery into my laptop  and immediately it said 70 percent charged. Later I let my laptop charge to 100% to see how long my laptop could 'feed off of the battery. It took 2.5 hours till my laptop required to be recharge. I have only had the new battery for a couple days, but so far it seems to be working well. I will update my review if i notice any drastic decrease in power supply/ or other issues that may pop up."
3.0,No bad
3.0,"This cover has done the job, basically. However there has been some fraying with the stitching that I had to snip off. I've purchased cases like this for other devices and they all start to breakdown in some way or another, over time. The fact that it happened almost immediately with this one was a mild frustration but easily addressed. It's probably most likely that I simply got a bad one. It's basically a solid case."
3.0,"nice case, could have came with instructions on how to open it to put the kindle in"
3.0,Case size is SMALLER in thickness than listed. WIll not work for my purposes but will be useful as storage units for reserve SD cards
3.0,Ok. Good protection.
3.0,"This case is a pretty sexy and svelte case for it's price point.  I ended up returning mine principally because I make regular use of my keyboard and thought it can function and be stowed with the keyboard attached - not enough contact is made between the magnets on the keyboard and edge of the Surface Pro 3 to actually stick (when keyboard is in it's elevated position).  My other concern is ventilation.  The cut-outs along the top and the side of the case don't align well (or at all) with the vents the SP3 requires to release heat.  Coupled with the case holder itself hugging the entirety of the device, the design doesn't allow for much heat dissipation.  If you use your SP3 mostly in tablet mode and don't do heavy duty anything (i.e. no games), the this case will work fine for you."
3.0,the color no good
3.0,It does rip videos unfortunate not very good quality.
3.0,It takes a while to charge and is a bit temporamental when trying to use it while charging. Very accurate when fully charged. Wish the slot for the tablet to stand was more sturdy.
3.0,While this is a good Genuine goal zero cable . It is way Over priced . Go to goal zero's own web site . It is much cheaper directly from them .
3.0,"This modem does work, however there is ZERO support for it from Netgear!  Netgear's website says there is a 90 day warranty with free set up help, but it that's only on “home products”. This modem counts as a “carrier product” so Netgear will not answer any questions or provide any help whatsoever unless you pay around $200 for their “extended warranty”.  If you need help with your brand new modem, call your Internet provider and maybe they can help. Past that you're on your own."
3.0,"I have several different brand and size tablets. Among them is the Galaxy II which I have been very pleased with other than the rathe short battery life. I purchased the Galaxy Tab 4 with great expectations thinking that it was going to be an even better tablet than my Galaxy2. Frankly I am very disappointed. The touch screen is very unresponsive and very frustrating. Samsung change the location of the Home, Back, and Screen buttons for some unknown reason and the location is very inconvenient. And lastly the modem does not perform as well as the one on the Galaxy 2."
3.0,Didn't exactly fit my drive bay.  Had to do a little finiggling but made it work.
3.0,"I purchased these because they were inexpensive, but they are just OK. They do work, but they don't get very loud at all, even with the volume on the computer at 100% and the volume on the speakers over 50%. There is no bass reproduction to speak of. The only redeeming qualities of these speakers are their inexpensive price and their small size."
3.0,"Honestly this ipad case is not meant for an IPad 1. Its better for an ipad 2. The case is way too loose if you put an ipad 1 in it. It does not cover the power button, and the case moves around with the ipad in it. It does not fit with a snug. Very loose and I cannot even press down on the power button because the case covers it. I love the color though, very vibrant, and the material is not at all cheap. FITS better for an ipad 2!!!"
3.0,"It is good, but smells like smoke"
3.0,"Contradictory feelings. Does it look good? Yes, I like it, looks cool. Is it as I expected? Not that much.<br />The package arrived fast and the sticker was all right.<br />My main complaint is that I got a package with a sticker, that is all, no single instruction or anything. OK, you do not need a MS to make it work (for not very talented people like me: I followed this nice video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRlN7Jb_-tY), but if I did it again for example, I would have cut the sticker in two to paste them closer and avoid alignment issues.<br /><br />The decal... it ended up being crooked haha, you can see my first picture. And you really see it is crooked because of the horizontal lines on the bottom of the figure! So I decided to take those off, and then it looks better, I think (second picture).<br />For the record, I have a 13-inch macbook pro.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to provide people with an actually straight sticker instead of a kind of trapezoid I got so applying it right would be easier.<br />Let us see how long it lasts!"
3.0,"The product is good as expected, it was upgraded to win 10 smoothly. It is performance is perfect. However the touchpad always stop working and you have to remove its driver and restart the device in order to restore its operation, but it keeps doing that in an annoying way. I guess it is a bug in the driver that needs to be fixed by ELAN, the company that made the driver. Another minor issue is the Ethernet port is very close to the power port, requiring you to rotate the 90 degree power connector every time you need to plug in your Ethernet cable (I do not know why Toshiba did not make that connector a straight one!)."
3.0,Looked stronger online...probably my own fault for not reading the details.
3.0,"dont really like it, the threads on the 2 that ive had are coming lose. i can see why they have a life time warranty, you have to keep sending them back, it's a waste of time."
3.0,"I have been using these for a month. One cord has stopped working. I don't see these lasting for years. However, I feel that I got what I paid for. If you need a bunch of cords at one time, these are good to start with."
3.0,I returned this item because I returned the Kindle Fire KDX which was not user friendly at all.
3.0,"I think it would save my keyboard from a quick spill, but it makes the keys rubbery, and for the most part, I don't like that.  I bought it simply to keep liquid out of my keyboard in case my little one were to create a mess around my Macbook."
3.0,"Does the job, charges my phone fairly quickly, and it great for back up / emergency, but only charges my HTC One M8 about 1/2-3/4 of the way before the pack dies. I have been seen others that will charge a phone twice over before the pack dies, I would not repurchase."
3.0,I've purchased two of them and both of them only lasted me a few months....one for about 2 months and the second one 3 months
3.0,This is now the fourth tablet from this same company. They always seem to malfunction in one way or another. The latest one the charging port will no longer work. This time it only took about a month or less for it to break
3.0,U can hear but can't see anything
3.0,"I got this monitor refurbished on Newegg for only $600 and figured that for the price it would be worth taking a look at the interesting technology this monitor provides.  Given that it was refurbished I figured it would have been fixed of all it's blemishes, and I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />Quality Control:<br /><br />There were 2 dead pixels which wasn't too noticeable, however it had around 8 smudges between the glass and the panel that made the monitor look like it was always dirty.  In addition, it had a very noticeable back light bleed from the top center of the screen that presented as a bright half moon.<br /><br />Gaming:<br /><br />Other than the horrible quality control this monitor appears to have, the actually panel technology is quite impressive.  I seriously cannot describe how amazing the ULMB mode is.  I like to describe the &#34;smoothness&#34; of an image in two ways.  Choppiness and blurring.  At 60hz, no matter what, there is not enough images presented fast enough to create a smooth image, and this will result in a slightly choppy image.  On the other hand, 144hz rendered enough images fast enough that there is no choppiness in the image at all.  However, even at 144hz, without the ULMB enabled, the image is VERY blurry.  Setting the monitor to even 85hz provides enough images fast enough to eliminate the choppiness when compared to 60hz, and with ULMB there is ZERO blurring of the image.  The best way to examine this is by using a controller in a game and panning the camera around.  As the camera rotates and images such as trees, building, mountains, etc pass across the screen, you will see two either the choppiness or the blurring, making it impossible to fully focus your sight on any moving object.  By running at a minimum of 85hz and enabling ULMB, you can see even the most minute details such as grain in the wood of a tree as it quickly passes across the screen.  Playing a game on this screen made me stop what I was doing several times just to pan the camera and enjoy the vista move around my character.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />As much as I loved the monitor, I can't recommend it.  The quality control is so bad, you will probably go through at least 5 RMAs in order to get a decent one.  The panel technology is great, but there are newer monitors that will be coming along pretty soon such as 34 inch ultrawide curved monitors that will also have g-sync and ULMB.  They may only run at 85-100hz due to displayport limitations, but as I have said 85hz is perfectly smooth with ULMB enabled.  My recommendation is to wait for one of those, or even another standard aspect ratio monitor that has these features but with better quality control."
3.0,"Has a very large housing for the small end. This means that it doesn't fit into my phone with the case on it, which is pretty annoying for a phone charger."
3.0,"Like , this is my third one"
3.0,Just ok  for the price you can't go wrong
3.0,"I ordered a black one, but got a brown one.  No really big deal, it is a dark brown.  Works like it should."
3.0,This case wears out quickly and slides off my Surface RT when opening.
3.0,Nice looking wrist pad.  Perfect size to accomodate Apple wireless keyboard and track pad.  Major problem remains unsolved:  fabric cover peels off after a few weeks of use.
3.0,Sound quality low
3.0,The keyboard is nice.  It has the feel of a standard laptop keyboard and functions beautifully.
3.0,"The minion decal for the Mac Book Pro 13&#34; retina is nice but with some minor flaws.  There are some slight discoloration on the minion that's doing the karate kick.  His head is not entirely yellow.  Other than that, it's a pretty nice decal.  The instructions were clear on how to put on the decal.  It was not difficult.  However, take your time putting it on to prevent any air bubbles.  Once you have air bubbles under the decal, it's pretty difficult rubbing it out. If you are trying to rub out the air bubble, don't press down to hard or you might get a slight tear.<br /><br />Even though my decal had some discoloration, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  It's not perfect but then again, I only paid $8."
3.0,"This product works great except for DHCP.  After configuring my own addressing scheme, WiFi and wireless devices stopped automatically obtaining IP Addresses."
3.0,"I will begin by saying that I have successfully installed many many screen protectors on different devices, so I know how the process works. Installing this screen protector was by far the most annoying and difficult. Firstly, the steamy shower did nothing to improve the dust situation on the screen of my paperwhite, and neither did the small sticky tape that was provided with the kit. I had so much trouble with my first screen protector, I had to throw it away. It's a good thing I got a 2 pack. I painstakingly repetead the cleaning and dust removal process, but continued seeing lint and dust under the protector. On a whim, I used my own screen cleaning cloth, and the protector finally adhered correctly, with no air bubbles. I am pretty sure that the screen protector itself is fine, but the cleaning cloth that comes with the kit leaves more junk on the screen than it removes. The sticky tape they provide is useless. This protector is on the expensive side, and I am really annoyed with the quality and the size of the cleaning cloth and tape that came with it. The irony of this review is that if (and that's a big IF) by some stroke of luck you manage a flawless installation, this screen protector is great. It is invisible, and  somehow seems to improve the touch performance of the kindle paperwhite screen. There is no glare, the protector does not affect the look of the screen. Some reviewers noted that the protector size was too small, but I disagree, the size is perfect for my 6 generation Kindle Paperwhite. There is a tiny but if a difference, under 1 mm, but it is barely noticeable, and designed so that protector can be removed from the screen."
3.0,"This modem works, but Netgear will not offer any support for it!  Netgear's website says there is a 90 day warranty with free set up help, but it that's only on “home products”. This modem counts as a “carrier product” so Netgear will not answer any questions or provide any help whatsoever unless you pay around $200 for their “extended warranty”.  If you need help with your brand new modem, call your Internet provider and maybe they can help. Past that you're on your own."
3.0,Good WIFI AP. Easy to set up and use. Above average coverage area compared to competitors models in the same price range.
3.0,Kingston Digital  They are good. But I was expecting that I come with 2TB but doesn't.  It just receive if you have 2 TB SD Card.
3.0,Does the job.  Nothing functionally wrong.  The shied feels really flimsy on the around the wire and gives cause for concern on its durability.
3.0,Great but needs the folio
3.0,Its o.k.
3.0,It was okay
3.0,Threads for the tripod mounting screw had to be re tapped.
3.0,"it is very easy to install,  Just turn it on, insert the disks and connect it to your network, open your web browser like chrome and type the address showed in the quick reference brochure included in the box, follow the steps to setup a user account and when finish the process you have to access the device using the web web browser again and it will prompt for your user and pasword, then you will enter to the decive interface to mannage it. Then you go to storage and change it to a RAID mode or another available mode if you want, or leave it as it was showing the two disks as separate units.  After that you can create folders that will automatically appears in your windows PC in the file explorer, under networks in the left panel, you can enter to this folder by clicking on it as any other folder in your PC. Then, if you want you can use the &#34;map network unit&#34; tool in windows file explorer to configure this folders as a drive unit then it will apear in the left panel of the windows file explorer as another drive like the &#34;C:&#34; drive.  Everything is very easy.  It is very noisy when being access for streaming media like movies using Plex, but after beeing used it will get quite againg.  I leave it turned on all the time, it just goes to sleeps mode but it weakes up automatically if you access any of the files through the PC, you do not notice anything, in fact after configuring the unit, you do not have to do anything at all to this device, just access the folder or the drives in your PC to add or delete files to it.  ...it works very well.  Update (15 Oct 2015)  Yesterday I tried to access the dashboard to create a new user, for my wife, but it seams the Device does not recognize it is already setup and sent me to the Starting Page to choose language as the first time I turned on. I am afraid the Device will try to rebuild the RAID configuration I had and lost all my files.  I have 2 WD red 6TB HDD in RAID 1, with all my Plex libraries and I do not want to lose everything i have there.  I have already asked for support, they reached me very quickly but they have not found a solution yet.  -----  Take this as a warning, becouse even if the problem get solved, this should never happend. It is a big risk to have a lot info in a Device that you cannot access, you can not Backup so much information easely. I am very worry."
3.0,Range not great
3.0,"This Item does not have a very good average quality, I ordered two for my dual monitor, one of them becomes defected after 5 hour's using."
3.0,Item not in original packaging.
3.0,"I've owned 3 different NOOK models and currently own a Samsung Tab 4 NOOK.  While none were perfect, I have been happy with them.  Having read all of the Kindle hype and finding an excellent offer, I purchased this model.  I'm not impressed.  I like that it came registered and partially set up, but the owners guide is very lame.  I am extremely frustrated with the lack of a HOME button.  Having to swipe up or down is easily transmitted as a screen scroll instead.  And I find that many of my favorite apps just aren't available for the kindle.  Ex.  I love the weather on my local ABC station, but kindle seems to only offer NBC.  So tired of being limited because companies are afraid of a little competition.  And the Silk browser, no wonder I never heard of it before; there is nothing good to say about it.  I will not purchase another kindle."
3.0,No comments
3.0,"I've had this for about 4 months now - a few observations:<br />1) It is very fast.<br />2) The build quality is only OK, not excellent.<br />3) It can get very hot - in fact so hot it's almost like something is wrong.<br /><br />The speed is amazing - don't think you can get much faster for this price.<br /><br />Build quality worries me. Very plastic. Also the palm rest area picks up finger prints like nothing else and is made of an almost furry plastic that I fear will decompose more quickly than more firm plastic (just my past experience with other devices, if the plastic is soft, it tends to die quicker).<br />Also because the build quality is poor my screen has two white &#34;pressure&#34; points because while the laptop was in my backpack it must have been squished a little too much and the screen was damaged. Nothing too terrible yet (even Mac Books get them so I hear), but I wish the screen was better protected (I've had it in a neoprene sleeve the whole time).<br />Also the touchpad is made of the same furry plastic and tends to stick rather than have a smooth glassy feel to it. Which can make use a little trying.<br /><br />The heat isn't a big factor, but it does get almost too hot for comfort on my lap.<br /><br />The screen quality is excellent. Great colors, great blacks, great contrast.<br /><br />Given the price - it is a great deal."
3.0,"Eh... Doesn't really play 1k (1024x720 AKA 720p or 1024x 768 resolutions.) very well even... I think the 750 is great for that. I got about 20-30 fps playing on 1k.with this. That is not even playable really. Crashed a lot. I hear amazon sells defective cards a lot though. I bought the 750 and the 750 still had trouble with 1k resolution. Save your money. A 960 is only $100 up the road and will play 2k (2048x1080) with 50-70fps in battlefield 4. Buy it from the manufacturer. That will serve all your needs, unless you want a REALLY good card like the 970 or 980 to play something like skyrim with full 2k (1080p) or 4k and an intense ENB, or battlefield with 60fps. The 740 is for really low games though, and the 750 and 760 will only get you about 30fps with 1k resolution.<br /><br />You also want some good memory so 4gb is pretty needed for games to prevent crashing from running out of vram."
3.0,"My use for this device is as an access point.  The manual did not provide any guidance on configuration as an AP, but I was able to muddle through it in about 45 minutes.  The bands are set for auto channel determination by default, and the 2.4 GHz frequency locks on to Channel 1.  My network analyzer indicates that Channel 14 would be the best choice.  So I go into configuration to set the Channel manually for Channel 14, and all the drop down is allowing me to select is Channels 1 through 11.  Not sure why this is, as I have the latest build."
3.0,"So far it has worked, HOWEVER when we got the tablet it still had ALL the previous owners information on it! Apps, pictures, and personal videos!!! Videos and pictures of their children! One would think that these would have been erased. Makes me not want to send any electronics back. How they refurbished this but left everything on it including their names is beside me!"
3.0,"An ok design except for one thing: The fan intakes are flush with the bottom of the unit, so if it's being used on your lap or any other soft surface, the fans can't bring in enough air to pump out. I tried it. It's not that the fans don't run, they just won't put out enough air from the top surface. Since laptops run hot I'd rather have fans pumping full the whole time. There are two pop-out stands to put the unit at an angle, but they only work on a hard surface. I didn't want to but I ended up returning it to Amazon."
3.0,"So far have to give it a 3/5, its a great little computer but have been have major issues with it so far.  The biggest one being that sometimes when I try and log on it will just get stuck in loading and will never actually log me on."
3.0,Love it ❤️
3.0,Product came on time and was as advertised.  I personally don't like the feel and responsiveness of the mouse when gaming.
3.0,"It's ok, still learning how to apply the info but i did think it was going to be better than it is."
3.0,Not gigabit
3.0,It's really easy to accidentally press the right button.
3.0,"Gorgeous screen.  My chief complaint is the page-turning buttons on the side -- about every time I hit the next page button, it sends me to the previous page instead.  Very annoying.  So I tend to turn pages using the screen instead of the buttons, but that leaves fingerprints on the screen."
3.0,It is a battery - What do you expect. It is suppose to work it did. It looks like a battery and fit into my computer. Did just what I expected it to do.
3.0,The sd reader only works half the time & usb slots may only work if one thing plugged in.
3.0,I liked the case.  It lasted about 1 year before the plastic got brittle and started to break.  Eventually the magnets that hold the case closed fell out and rendered the case practically useless.  I have replaced it with a different brand.
3.0,Arrived broken in a plastic bag with the lamp pulled apart from the post. I fixed it and superglued it back together. It works fine now.
3.0,Works better than original....
3.0,"Seemed ok at first, but within about 2-3 months one of the cords stopped working completely and the other is extremely finicky. Just seems to be &#34;loose&#34; when plugged into the phone or Kindle. I threw one away and have the other as a backup, backup, backup. You get what you pay for with these."
3.0,The product definitely works: it's a matter of how badly damaged your hard drive is for it to work. I tried several and 1 out of 4 worked. I would still recommend this unit.
3.0,Cord wears out a little in a couple of months but otherwise its great for the price
3.0,average quality based on price
3.0,"The battery doesn't fit perfect, looks the same as the old one."
3.0,Thin material but good photo quality. And the handles are nice
3.0,Nothing spectacular but does the job! It's extra RAM for a good price!
3.0,"Listen,  I ordered two of thse and I wish I could give a review on each.  One of them works great and looks amazing.  The other had a short in the cable and wouldn't work correctly."
3.0,Max speed was only 65 mb/s on usb 3.0...
3.0,The tablet is just okay and my kid likes it
3.0,"Pros<br />works<br />has decent microphone<br />great audio<br /><br />Cons<br />constant feedback when talking to others (even when the mic is turned off with the turn off switch, and when that happens all in-game or any audio is transmitted to the people I am talking to, making it difficult to gave background noises)<br />mic is SUPER sensitive (and yes I have played with the settings and know what I am doing)<br />not as comfy as I hoped, I have a big head and ears and always makes them sore"
3.0,Noisy...but ok
3.0,"Works well, but it's much too large for comfortable use. I'll keep it, but I seriously doubt that I'll ever use it."
3.0,Would like a light that covers a little more area.
3.0,The fan itself is great but mounting kit definitely not! The fan has plastic mounting kit on the fan case so the screw might be the broke the plastic hole (which happened to me) and you definitely have to be careful while installing this. Corsair should have change that plastic hole!
3.0,Serves it purpose- wish it was heavier so it wouldn't move the second the cords moved a little. Will have to secure it.
3.0,My only complaint is that the cord easily disconnects from the headset!. Great sound quality.
3.0,"Works well, I use it as a development server running Windows server 2008"
3.0,"When it is full with iPad, phone, pens, note pad and other miscellaneous items the weight causes the bag to deform at the top where the strap connects to the bag. In the past I had a bag where the iPad was stored horizontal rather than vertical and the bag did not deform nearly as bad. I like the number of pockets and the overal construction. Only time will tell if the distortion at the top of the bag will cause premature failure at the top."
3.0,"This device requires you to use its new and separate wifi access point, I.E. &#34;home123 becomes home123xxx&#34;. If you do a speed test it cuts download speed down by half but it does make the wifi signal strong as long as it can connect to the original wifi source regardless of strength."
3.0,"I used to use Wi-Fi and Skype would cut out a lot. These don't give me speed as fast as Wi-Fi, but I haven't had any disconnects since I bought them. Great for gaming!"
3.0,"Had a great selection of colors and designs, but started to fall apart after a while. After using it for about 3 months, half of the keys on the keyboard stopped working, and the case started to peel away. It was great for the first few months but then fell apart. I had to buy a new case after about 9 months of use on the case, and about 4 months of use on the keyboard,"
3.0,"I bought this device to have more memory ( 4gb vs 2 gb) and a brighter display when reading at night, I have an original Kindle with push buttons instead of touch screen. When setting up the Paperwhite the screen froze up and I could not get it to respond, even after cutting it off and back on. So, because of ths negative experience, I returned it because I lost confidence in it and, frankly, for some reason, my original Kindle just felt better."
3.0,"I can't get any Wacom support so I don't really know if I like it or not. I sent several emails with multiple questions to Wacom Support. They answered one question, the easiest one. Haven't heard anything from them since then. They must have closed my case #. I almost sent it back because if I need support I can't count on Wacom. I like the idea of what a tablet can do but I'll just have to learn it by trial and error. I haven't touched it in weeks...."
3.0,"fits a little bit snug, the cable can't fit inside it comfortably"
3.0,"Dear Kindle:<br /><br />I'm disappointed this version (and probably all newer ones) is a commercial to buy things as much as anything else. Where are the lovely drawings and etchings that one finds when kindle is in sleep mode or just awakens? While this version is a little more convenient to use-- I'm sad you don't have the courage to stay with simple and sublime. All the reader needs and not more is not a place to shop, nor overly complicated &#34;convenience&#34; as though it is a computer (we have enough of those). But instead a simple motif for those who like to read--some beautiful imagery in black and white and one's chosen  library.  &#62;sigh&#60;  Won't be buying much…I can guarantee you that."
3.0,"Update 8/6/2017: Buy this combo for the keyboard not the mouse. The mouse worked for several months then died. Just as well since I never liked it to begin with. The keyboard however has been perfect for my needs and is still functioning well after two years. Any other mouse with unifying technology will work with the keyboard so not that big a deal for me. The keyboard 5 stars, the mouse 1, the combo 3. The value for the money is more like a 3 since the mouse boosts the cost on what would likely be a less expensive keyboard if sold by itself. Which makes the combo a bit of a rip off.<br /><br />Received this keyboard yesterday and so far it is working as advertised. It is slightly bigger and heavier than my old kb. I use my TV as monitor for my laptop and sit on the sofa approx. 6-8 ft away and have the keyboard on my lap when typing. No problem with response, no lag time in typing response as complained about by some other reviewers. I notice the spring pressure on the keys seems a little more taut than what I have been used to but this is not significant and will probably become less as the board is broken in.<br /><br />The overall design of the and look of the kb is nice enough but I could do without the clear plastic trim around the edges. As I examine it, it looks like I may be able to remove it by separating the face and back and just lifting it out. Doesn't appear to be glued on.  I may just do that in time. (Update 09/02/15: Removed clear plastic trim and board has a much better look IMO. It does leave about 1/8&#34; space where the plastic was but board is very responsive and the numbers pad works better than before on my board, especially the numbers 2 and 3. Plastic trim doesn't just lift off. The tops of the plastic tabs holding the trim in place popped off (quite easily I might add) when removing  it so any possibility of returning or exchanging the board if problems develop going forward is negated. I'm fine with that. :-)<br /><br />The mouse is also bigger than my other Logitech mice and the scroll wheel does not have a smooth, fluid roll to it as my others do. It is apparently designed with notches or slots in its roll. While I do not like the feel of it right now, the upside is if my finger accidentally brushes across or touches the wheel it doesn't cause the screen to scroll or jump as with my other mice. Which is actually a good thing. The cursor movement was not good until I replaced the battery with a new one. Appears to be responding fine now.<br /><br />Calculator key on the kb got no response on several taps a few minutes ago but did eventually bring up the calculator and has been working fine since. Hopefully this will not be an ongoing or worsening problem. (Update 09/08/15: It appears when the calculator has not been used for some time it takes one tap to awaken it and the second tap brings it up. After awakening it responds on the first tap after that. At least until you haven't called on it for a while and then it has to be awakened again. Strange behavior for a calculator key seems to me but that is the way it works, at least on my KB.)<br /><br />This is a very early review so will update if I run into any serious problems or defects with this kb and mouse."
3.0,"This is a really nice, professional looking portfolio cover with a notepad at a great price.  BUT--there is NO protection or padding on the corners for your iPad.  I found this out the hard way.  Did not even drop it, just had it in my bag on a cold morning, put the bag down (gently--not dropped) while waiting, and the iPad was damaged on one of the outside corners--the corner of the iPad rests right on the zipper, so it's not only not padded, but on something rather hard.  So if you're putting it in a padded slot in a briefcase--GREAT, but don't expect this to really *protect* the iPad."
3.0,Good. Life is shorter than 3 hours
3.0,"Nice leather bag at a decent price.  It does have an odor, but I didn't think it was overly strong or objectionable.  Some glue did ooze out of the handle when new, but it dried and dissipated after a couple of days.  The shoulder strap design was somewhat regrettable.  There doesn't seem to be a way to deal with extra strap if it is adjusted past the first couple of holes for the buckle.  Strange.  Looks cool, though.  The pockets on the front and sides are too small for anything other than a set of keys.  Modern cell phones will not fit."
3.0,"I did build a new computer recently. I was wondering if It would be okay if I install this to my new system because this one is much cheapar from the others. Thank god I had no problem with it so far. Thanks to Amazon.<br /><br />edit: After using it for a month, the ram having stability issues. My computer freezing out of nowhere. using this with Maximus 8 Ranger / i7 6700K.. I have ordered Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB."
3.0,The literature is not clear for average user
3.0,"After having the switch for a little over a year, the USB switch part frequently just stops working.  Initially it worked great, now, I have to pull the power, pull USB cables, power it up and re-insert the USB cables.  I'm shopping for a new one."
3.0,"Short, appears to be fragile, it does work."
3.0,I ordered two of these covers for my Mac. The clear one worked out well and came in a reasonable time. The gold one came broken so not able to use at all.
3.0,Pretty easy to apply and I appreciate the ability to adjust the placement.  The problem and praise is the thickness.  I find that it requires a harder touch and that can cause a problem when trying to type.  Overall I feel that it is good and durable but after having a tempered glass screen protector on another device I am very picky.
3.0,"I know brand new laptops aren't supposed to come with errors, but after an update, I continuously received blue screens with the error: &#34;PFN_LIST_CORRUPT&#34;. I'm pretty sure that error is difficult to remove, considering how many solutions I have tried but none have worked.<br /><br />Aside from the errors, the computer has wonderful performance. It isn't slow and none of the programs or apps fail. The CD/DVD drive works, the mousepad works, and sound work.<br /><br />It isn't the best laptop, but you can work with it."
3.0,so so
3.0,Its good but its kind of hard to type and it gets dusty.
3.0,Been using for nearly a year and the smell is still overbearing.
3.0,This is an excellent product although I had to return to Microsoft for a new one as it died two weeks after delivery. Surprised that it doesn't have an hdmi video output and had to purchase a special adapter to view on another monitor or big screen TV.
3.0,It doesn't snap on all the way but it'll do
3.0,"For what its worth it is a fine mouse but the ergonomics cant belie its cheap mouse beginnings, Take a laser mouse from the past decade and place an ergonomic shape over it and you get the J-Tech.<br /><br />Compared to todays optical mice. it is very hard to get precise movement that is necessary for even cut and paste work with the cursor.<br />It is also terrible for gaming but I feel most folks want to use this to relieve carpal tunnel and wrist pain.<br />At this function the mouse succeeds. The mouse is very comfortable but I feel that  removing the wrist rest helped for more precise work.<br /><br />For the time being this mouse will work but I feel I will go back to a regular mouse sooner than later"
3.0,Appears that Apps may be somewhat limited
3.0,it is alright
3.0,"This is my 4 one.  1 died after a month,  1 after 3 months, 1 after 4 or 5months.  Well see how long this lasts.  It is very convenient to have such a long cord!!!!"
3.0,Never got it working again.
3.0,Kinda cheap feeling. Don't really think this is a $9 product.
3.0,"I was hoping it would reach into two other builtings that are within 100 feet from where the router is at, and it does not  reach that far.<br />  Other then that it works okay."
3.0,"They work as they are supposed to. The ear area is a little smaller around than I would prefer. I like the Turtle Beach X12 better but I guess you get what you pay for. The mic is normal quality for a headset like this, I wouldn't say it is worse than the X12s. There should be a way to clip the wire to your shirt as the volume control block is really thick and big and gets in the way."
3.0,"This is the only vertical magnetic holster I could find for my iPhone 6, so despite the very cheap leather (if real at all; not worth $35), I will still keep it.  After only one month, it is showing wear at the corners.  Unless you really want the vertical magnetic closure, you can pay less elsewhere."
3.0,"This will work for a very lite user, email checking and web surfing computer. Not for heavy user or programs that require a lot of power."
3.0,"This case not only feels flimsy but was also bulky. Its very design makes it impossible to utilize the surface pro 3 to its full potential. Here are the list of things it hinders me from using:<br /><br />1) It prevents me from using the kick stand as it covers the entire back of the device. It replaces it with fold-over cardboard thing that only allows 1 viewing angle.<br />2) It causes my surface pro 3 to overheat as it covers up all the vents and causes it to SHUT OFF mid-use.<br />3) It prevents me from using the magnetic keyboard feature to tilt up the keys as the cover is way too bulky.<br /><br />Not only that, it doesn't provide adequate protection. The edges are far too close and if it falls screen down I can guarantee that your device will break. I just contacted customer service and I will increase my ratings from 1 to 3 if they follow through with my request for a refund."
3.0,Very hard to get off computer once it is on.
3.0,"As others have stated, be careful of fakes.  I ordered a third one of these cards to replace a previous one that, for some reason, my Note 4 doesn't like (even though other phones and even PC's have no issue with).  I was wary of other reviews about fakes but knew Amazon would handle it if that arose.  Sorry to say it did.  When the card package arrived it had some hallmarks of a fake - poor printing on the front image (like a poor inkjet printer), Chinese text first on the back (and an English translation with some errors, btw), a fake P/N ending in &#34;CHN&#34; (e.g. China) as well as a UPC code (underneath the Amazon sticker) that correlated with a 16GB card, not this one.  Opening the package the SD card adapter was poorly printed; the text font didn't look correct and the color was a bit faded in the middle (again, poor printing).  The card itself had very vibrant colors compared with the old card (exactly the same card btw) and was black on the sides as well as the back - legit cards have white sides.  On the back it said &#34;made in Taiwan&#34; (legit cards are made in Korea) and the fake had a &#34;Samsung&#34; holographic sticker on it but the legit card no sticker (I guess the fraudsters think a flashy sticker will fool people).<br /><br />The phone recognized it fine as &#34;64GB&#34; and formatted it, took some photos and it seemed OK.  If you didn't read other reviews, at this point the novice would assume that the card is good to go and that's it. BUT, I decided to run it through its paces in H2TESTW - this program basically writes a unique set of data to the ENTIRE card (all 64GB) then reads it back to see if any data is corrupted.  These fake cards are generally only ~ 4-8GB and &#34;fool&#34; an OS into believing they are 64GB cards when in fact after the initial 4-8GB they just continually overwrite themselves - so if you were to use this for, say, photos, after 7GB or so it would just overwrite itself, corrupting existing data.  H2TESTW tests for this and lo and behold, found that read errors began at about 7.3GB.  Ironically, after the test, the card no longer read in any device including PCs - it was completely dead, so back to Amazon it went.r this and lo and behold, found that read errors began at about 7.3GB.

3.0,Had a difficult time getting four monitor to work with when using DP hubs.  I went with a AMD Firepro 7100 which easily supported four 4k monitors
3.0,This is not a dual link. This is a single link cable
3.0,"I got this to hold my 11 inch Macbook Air.  It fits like a glove.  In fact, I think it's a bit too snug.  The laptop fits perfectly, but it's a squeeze to get the power adapter in with it.  I'd rather have a slightly larger bag where everything fits comfortably."
3.0,Huge inside pockets that fit everything. Even my 17' laptop and all chords and mouse! Wish the zipper pocket was bigger but a good buy for the price
3.0,its not working as well as i hoped
3.0,"The delivery time was fast. I ordered the red, but is not the red that I wish. the tone is very clear even when I put on my Mac. I looked so much the red option in others brands and thought this would be the indicated. Fits good on my retina display 13 model A1502."
3.0,"The first one stopped working so had to be replaced.  The replaced one has childrens pictures as background  artwork.  I thought it was suppose to work with the keyboard i bought through bluetooth, but it doesn't.  I do like the camera.  It didn't come with the dictionaries or any of my books.  The books were not in the second kindle, i had to spend well over an hour having someone download them into it, and still i have to go back and get my dictionaries."
3.0,The Good:<br />Seems Reliable.<br />Simultaneous 2 & 5 Ghz Streams<br />Fairly Advanced Firmware<br />Good Looking<br /><br />The Bad:<br />BIG<br />LED Lights Up Front Are Overkill and Indistinguishable Anyways<br />Firmware Can Be Confusing<br />5 Ghz Uses Internal Antennas Which Makes It QUITE Weak In Comparison to 2.4Ghz
3.0,gift
3.0,works well for the price
3.0,Ethernet over power line not as fast as CAT5/6 cable
3.0,Works so far but does not fit iPhone in Otterbox case since it has a wider base than the typical lightning charger - unfortunately that defeats my purpose of buying it
3.0,"This HDD dock works fair, down side is that it doesn't have any antistatic protection for the HDD.<br /><br />Sometimes it doesn't detect HDD's that a regular single HDD bay would.<br /><br />Packaging was good and well protected."
3.0,"I like it well enough, just a tad expensive. I wish there was an option to use the stick without the throttle for some games, but the 2 are inseparable."
3.0,It was thin and light but did not make me feel safer with my phone
3.0,"Works good its as long as it says but ,it is however very low end on the built."
3.0,Errr... didn't fit Moto E version 2.  At least mine didnt.  But has the free return thanks to amazon!
3.0,Only lasted two years (less than the original) and now I have to buy another one. Maybe I will buy an original because the generics are not making the cut.
3.0,I have 4 of these running in a Synology NAS since 2012.  I have had 2 replace 2 of them so the active life isn't the greatest but then again they are meant for desktop use.
3.0,Not the best quality but the price isn't bad either
3.0,Works well with dragon but wireless battery doesn't last more than half an hour. Yes I followed the charging instructions.
3.0,Does not clock properly with Asus P8H61-M
3.0,"The charger is an ok purchase if you are in desperate need of one, but if you have the means for a official surface charger buy that instead. This one does its job, but the one I received to stop and start charging at random times."
3.0,"I purchased these headphones specifically for the color combination as a gift for my brother. The headphones I received in the mail were blue and black and, after contacting Amazon, I was informed that Amazon Prime does not ship the yellow and gray headphones. I got refunded for half the price and kept the headphones. My brother was kind of disappointed, but they're good headphones and good quality - just not as advertised.<br /><br />Remember, if you don't have a port for the headphones and a mic, you'll need to get an adapter. This works well with the adapter we purchased with no problem."
3.0,"Not a fan of the case, but had to order for a customer."
3.0,"Very nice headset, fully worth the price, right up until the point where the left side stopped working. Seems like a broken wire in the cord, as the sound comes back briefly if I jiggle it. 3 years old, so out of warranty. A shame. :( Would have been 4 (it IS pricey) or 5 (it IS a great headset) otherwise."
3.0,"You get what you pay for, this tablets pretty great for kids which is what I use it for."
3.0,It is not oleophobic so the touches have some drag.
3.0,"Isn't as bright as the picture looks.  Kinda disappointed, but the airflow is great!"
3.0,"I recently bought an iPad Air to replace my old iPad2.  I ordered what I thought was the same case for the new device that I'd had for the old one.  Everything works the same except that when you close the cover, the iPad doesn't go to sleep.  I have to click it off.  Kind of disappointing -- hence, the 3 rating."
3.0,"First my complaints, this does not seem like it was built for the logitec G27(what im using it for) one the shifter does not properly latch onto the stand and if placed next to the steering wheel it barly fits, I could not figure out how to mount the pedels to the bas but even if i let it rest there, the metal strut gets in the way of breakign and proper foot placement. also the actual table part of the stand does not rotate 90 Degrees  up, thus making the lower rotations of the actual main piece to be useles(this would be done for average height people sitting low). it also takes a lot of work to tweak any of the settings if you have the wheel attached.<br /><br />overall I would probably have looked for something else but im not unhappy with it, just disappointed that it really was not good for my needs."
3.0,Case looks really nice and fits well but the magnet fell out after a month of use.
3.0,I just bought it....but its asking for password... dose any1 know the pass word
3.0,"Very fast shipping, fan works well. Feels a little bit cheap compared to other brands but only took off 1 star. I took off another star because the installation turned into a custom job. I had to pre-drill the already pre-drilled holes so that I could use the provided screws. If you need to plug your fan directly into your power supply then this is the one you want since it has the 3 speed feature. If you don't get a fan with a speed override then it will run at 100% all the time and it will be loud, unless you plug it into your motherboard. My MSI motherboard only had 2 fan headers so I needed a fan that I could plug directly into my power supply and could still adjust the fan speed."
3.0,"The ball did not move smoothly when I opened the box m. This is my third purchase of this particular mouse, so I replaced the ball with one from my older mouse.  The older mouse buttons wore out, but the ball was fine."
3.0,Ok
3.0,"There is a lot of plastic in this build, it feels cheap, the controls are great, but I was not very happy with the lack of mounting options. Its not bad though."
3.0,"I was recently offered two of the latest 32GB MicroSDXC cards from Sandisk (the product on this page) and [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY]] free to review, and of course, I accepted.  Additionally, I threw in one of my own personal [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC cards]] to make this a triple comparison review.  MicroSD cards are a common storage media today used in various phones, tablets and action cameras like GoPros, so I'm going to focus this review on the read/write speed of the cards.  I speed tested all of the cards with CrystalDiskMark 3.0 using a [[ASIN:B009D79VH4 Transcend USB 3.0 card reader]] on a USB 3.0 port.<br /><br />(Also see below for the attached screen grabs of the results).<br /><br />The PNY card scored well achieving its promised 90MB/second read speed and a very respectable 55MB/s write speed well in excess of UHS Class 3 (which specifies 30MB/s minimum write speeds) which makes the PNY card suitable for recording 4K video.<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB High Speed MicroSDHC - P-SDU32GU390G-GE]]<br />Sequential Read :  90.912 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  54.702 MB/s<br /><br />In comparison, [[ASIN:B010Q57T02 the SanDisk Ultra 32GB card]] didn't do so well...<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B010Q57T02 SanDisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDHC - SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA]]<br />Sequential Read :  82.132 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  15.359 MB/s<br /><br />While the read speed is good, for many applications, including still and video photography, its all about the write speed.  Unfortunately this particular SanDisk card I was offered for review doesn't cut it - and as of the time of this review, this is one of their latest cards.  I know they have faster cards, but they also charge A LOT more money for them.  Additionally, I've had bad luck with SanDisk cards in the past including write errors using higher-spec SanDisk Ultra cards in GoPros, and my previous Android phone would randomly dismount the SanDisk Ultra card I was using at the time - and it was a top of the line card at the time... so I'm not a SanDisk fan.<br /><br />What I am a fan of is the third card in this triple comparison review, the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]].  They are super fast, they have been ultra reliable, and they are reasonably priced (The last one I purchased was $34.99 in November, 2014).  This Samsung card beats both of the others in the all important write speed and is only a fraction behind the PNY in read speed:<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC - MB-MG64DA/AM]]<br />Sequential Read :  87.806 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  75.562 MB/s<br /><br />So if I had to choose, I would take the Samsung Pro card, hands down... and I have!  In fact, I own five Samsung Pro MicroSDs and two full size [[ASIN:B00IVPU6BY Samsung 64GB PRO SDXC cards]] that live in my phones, tablets, DSLR and GoPros.  And since I started using them over two years ago, I haven't had a single issue or incident like I have with SanDisk cards in the past.<br /><br />So while this may be a review for the SanDisk Ultra 32GB card, I'd say there are much better cards for the money.  If you're looking for a fast MicroSDXC card, you should consider the [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB card]] (also available in 16 & 64GB) or if you want the fastest write speeds and proven reliability, consider the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]], which is also available in 16 & 32GB varieties (see important update, below).  If all you're interested in is storage capacity and write speed is not a consideration, then I'm sure the 128GB & 200GB Sandisk cards will work for you, but writing to them is going to be a long, slow process.  (Though, you should also consider the [[ASIN:B00XJKL1ME Samsung Evo+ 128GB Micro SDXC card]] if you looking for a 128GB card).<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE, 11/09/15:<br /><br />It has come to my attention thatSamsung may be in the process of replacing their Pro line of cards with a Pro+ line of cards.  I see that the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]] has limited to no availability at this time and as such is being offered at ridiculously high prices by 3rd party sellers.  The new Samsung Pro+ cards do not have a single product page at this time, but rather the first ones are also being listed by 3rd party sellers, [[ASIN:B01273L37G here (32GB)]] & [[ASIN:B012DTJ8NU here (64GB)]].  Personally, if you are interested in the new Samsung Pro+ cards, I would wait until Amazon itself has them in stock so that you know you are getting a genuine (not counterfeit) card and the price will likely be better, too.  If you can't get the Samsung card, you should consider the [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 64GB]] card as it is still superior to the Sandisk card in this review.Samsung may be in the process of replacing their Pro line of cards with a Pro+ line of cards.

3.0,"It's a beautiful case and makes my macbook look gorgeous, however the case started falling apart over last couple days... won't stay on and tabs that hold the case on breaking off. Bummed because it's so pretty. Wished they made it with better quality plastic or something."
3.0,"I bought this router for several reasons.  The wife and kids complained of weak wifi spots around the house which this fixed instantly!  After my initial installation I had problems with it re-booting every couple of minutes after it downloaded and installed an update and had to eventually reset the router and once I did it has been working great for over 2 months now - no problems since and would give it 5 stars for performance.  I also bought it for the Parental Control features, hoping to be able to limit my kids access to the internet after a certain time.  My son seems to think its Ok to play Xbox until 3am and was lead to believe by their web site that you could control it.  The router and mydlink service does have parental controls, unfortunately they DON'T WORK and he is able to defeat the time limits and lock out feature by simply turning on and off his devices.  I would give the Parental Control features 0 Stars since they are a useless and a waste of time.  I contacted their customer support email team and have yet to receive a response (3 weeks and waiting)  If your just looking for good wifi service for around your home / office with a need for guest access this is a great unit but very pricey.  Knowing what I know now and base upon my current needs, I am wishing I would have purchased a router with WORKING Parental Controls.  Hopefully an upcoming firmware upgrade will fix this???"
3.0,"There are some things I really like about this case, however it was cracking in several places pretty soon after I started using it which was a little annoying.  The case itself isn't bulky and closes up well.  It looks nice (Or at least it did before I taped it up like crazy) but even with very gentle use- no drops- it's going to need to be replaced pretty soon after I received it."
3.0,transaction was goo . But a friend had bought one and she told me she thought it very complicated to use. She is a computer teacher.  So I knew it wasn't for me and so I srnt it back.
3.0,"Its a lower end laptop for sure.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Modern Processor with Broadwell<br />8 gig ram<br />1 tb hard drive ( but slow see below)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Screen is not very good.  Despite the lower resolution than more expensive laptops, the panel has pretty bad contrast and viewing angles.  I've seen displays at the same resolution be much better.  The low contrast is particularly bad as everything looks washed out.<br /><br />No discrete graphics. Not a big deal if you don't plan to game on the laptop but it will not do much graphically, although it can output video to a monitor at a decent resolution.<br /><br />Speakers--I send this back as I was worried my laptop was defective--they seem to have a good location (on body of machine next to display) but volume output was awful.  I realize it won't be great speakers, but this was pretty bad. Your mileage may vary as I'm not sure if they were defective or not.<br /><br />Keyboard--not great.  Travel and force actuation needed to type are not good..  This is not a click-clack keyboard--more like mush. I have certainly had some worse ones.  I do not think this would be a favorite keyboard for a touch typist.  At least the keys have decent size, have an island style spacing and a full keypad<br /><br />Webcam--Meh.  Nothing special.  There are array micophones but did not get a chance to test very extensively. Set up to work with Cortana voice assist and microsoft windows 10.<br /><br />DVD--one of the few new machines you can get that still comes with a dvd player/burner.  Did not use.  Sadly no playing blue rays on this thing (without an extra blue ray player!)<br /><br />1 TB hard drive--it is slow even for a standard hard drive and much much slower than an ssd .  But at least there is plenty of room for storing data!<br /><br />If you need a starter computer that won't travel much, this is a decent deal if you can get it for less than $500.  Any more than that and you might be overpaying.  Some are very sensitive to poor displays and you have to consider eyestrain from looking at blocky text with poor contrast for hours on end.  But using with an external monitor is a thought.<br /><br />I do not think this is a machine that has easy access to internals due to the  size and thin profile.  So while the memory is not soldered on, having to dis-assembly most of the machine to get access to it is not fun either.<br /><br />Battery life--I think this is still too big to really move around too much so don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />Build quality--mostly plastic, nothing special, this is not a machine to worry about build quality given the price range.

But the display is the worst of the bunch (and possibly most important in a laptop).<br /><br />Its a good basic machine with some flaws but the price does help.  Still, a better display would have helped a lot.<br /><br />Remember, do not pay more than $500 if you can help it.

3.0,The camera is poor.  The downloads are easy.
3.0,Love the size...have to get a new wall charger.. but being replaced for free..<br /> Over all so far so good..
3.0,"Material feels durable, but not confident that the screen will stay protected since my child can touch the bare screen through the case, instead of the case having plastic to avoid fingerprints and having something drop on the screen. May be returning this item."
3.0,"This device lowered the measured noise floor of my Dacport LX USB DAC by 3-4dB vs. a Belkin powered hub.  104dB is pretty close to the performance limit of the interface I used to measure, so this unit may even do more than that.  It did not completely remove background noise from the attached headphone amplifier (Schiit Asgard 2), but I have to turn the volume almost up to almost maximum to hear any background noise now.  Update: I got an Olimex USB-ISO instead of this unit, and it provides much better isolation.  The Olimex works fine with my 24/96 USB DAC, but it may not support ludicrous speed, so YMMV."
3.0,MEH
3.0,Not what I ordered.  No 19V output as advertised.  But it will do.  I'm using 19 1/2 and hoping everything goes OK.
3.0,"Everytime I buy a chromebook, the screen seems unnecessarily fragile. None of my other laptop screens have broken from the simple act of closing and opening them. Otherwise, good for browsing."
3.0,Worked great for about 6 months then just broke suddenly.  Probably worth the price paid.  Had decent response time while it worked.
3.0,Not overly whelmed. It served it's purpose which was to help my grandson with his homework
3.0,It was good but just a little bit of some sound issues
3.0,"Received quickly, however, Toshiba misrepresents the size of these drives.  Stated as 5TB, but actually less than 4.5TB.  A 500MB error is unacceptable and makes me question Toshiba's QA.  The drive works correctly and was priced well. but I will never buy a Toshiba product again due to false advertising."
3.0,First one came broken. They replaced it no problem. Second one works great.
3.0,The split for the eat phones is small. Fits Kiss only.
3.0,"I like the product, but maybe I did something wrong when placing it because the last corner didn't stick and now is lifting up little by little. I would probably have to order a new one soon."
3.0,"The case does its duty, I really like the magnetic sleep/awake function that it provides.<br />The downsides are the color begins to fade around the edges a bit quickly after only a short while, and the folding cover stand has a weak magnetic pull that will sometimes not grab if you aren't careful to search for the right position. Once this happens, of course the tablet falls backwards."
3.0,"The fan is very handly and fine, but the fan speed is very low, just for a little wind."
3.0,"I don't know if it was just me or how my original ones fell of my macbook, but I had a hard time applying these on. I ended up taping them on lol. But now I have a laptop case so I don't have to worry anymore"
3.0,It's cool! Bought it for my son for a birthday gift. He likes it too!
3.0,"Being an old Kindle Fire owner, I am a bit disappointed with the battery life.  I often left my old (larger 7-8&#34; Kindle) on standby without powering off for days.  I was buying this one to replace my old one which has become somewhat unreliable in the battery charging area.  With a full charge and no use sleeping for 4 days, it had about 17% battery life remaining.  The old one slept for a couple weeks and still had a small charge if left unused.<br /><br />I am not sure what the HD does for you in a screen smaller than the old paperback books, the old 7-8&#34; Kindle was sharp, this one even sharper, HD.  Eyes can't discern the small details available, wide screen done miniature?  Beautiful colors from the display though!  Watching movies, a great choice.  Reading books, an adequate choice.  Planning a long trip with no plug-ins, leave it home and plugged in."
3.0,"I bought it because it was supposed to be delivered with a EU plug, but it did not. Product not as described.  Now I have to attach an adapter to the plug which is bothersome and sometimes does not connect well."
3.0,Feels like a strong thick cotton material. It is a bit smaller than in the picture
3.0,"I dropped the iPad in this case onto carpet-- a medium fall. The case broke, but at least the iPad didn't! You can't choose the angle, and you can't have the iPad propped up without the keyboard there (like to watch TV). I was kinda glad it broke because I was pretty tired of it."
3.0,"Footprint is a bit long, it seems to share the shell design with the Anker mouse.  Has adapter storage and good button placement.  My fingers tended to go at a different angle than the mouse buttons, and something about the grip seemed unnatural to me.  A hump in the palm or something."
3.0,"The switch does what it is supposed to do for the exception of one thing. The cat5 ends on the back aren't fully attached. So when you try to attach an Ethernet cable into it, the connections go back into the case, making a solid connection hard to get."
3.0,"Pictures don't really show the back too well. I though is would be a nice looking rear panel to plug my fans into, but it is open space with a bunch of wires hanging around. Not very modular. No MOLEX adapters for fans with only molex connections (it doesn't say it comes with it, but just letting everyone know in case you didn't think of it). Just wish it looked a bit better and cleaner in the back end."
3.0,It fits and you get sticker guides
3.0,Made with cheep plastic.
3.0,"This sleeve wasn't bad, wasn't great, so three stars is what it gets. The elastic portion is nice, and easier to use than a button or clasp, however from the little i've used it I can tell it won't hold up fantastically through the years. Nothing some velcro won't fix. The lining inside is pretty smooth, and the two pockets can hold....I don't know, something pretty flat. No charger is going into those. A pretty simple look (which isn't a bad thing) and so far it's doing its job, and for $12, it's all I need it to do."
3.0,"I've had this for a week now. First impressions are good. I've deleted a few apps as they have no interest to me. I upgraded to windows 10 straight away as I don't like windows 8 so I am still learning as my old laptop is windows 7. So far the only typing I have done is emails but already the most annoying feature about this laptop is that unless you hit it right in the middle, the space bar doesn't work. I am not a typist so I look at the keys while I am typing. I only typed one line but when I looked up there were 3 instances where the spacebar hadn't worked and words were joined together. This slows you down when you have to keep going back to put spaces in. Not sure what I can do about this and I know it's really going to annoy me. The jury's still out on whether I will get on with this laptop."
3.0,"This sort of works, but every time I turn on my computer the mouse and keyboard are on opposite &#34;channels.&#34; I have to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in to get it to work on the same channel that the mouse is on."
3.0,"Charger works fine, only issue is the power brick gets REALLY hot. The brick on mine is warped from the plastic heating too much, and I'm sure if I try to hold it firmly after it's been on for a while it would burn me (it has left slight burn marks on my pillow when I forgot I had it plugged in for about 30 min and left the brick on the pillow). I got it 4 months ago and it's still working, so I guess it's good for ten bucks, but the whole fire hazard risk of it isn't anything I'm crazy about..."
3.0,"Sensitivity is too much on both sides.  I understand I can turn that down but this pad is not exactly ideal for gaming.  It will last 1000 times longer than any normal mouse pad, but the few times I tried using this for League of Legends I found my mouse racing around the screen.  I know I am probably a freak in this way but what I do that most people probably don't is that I use a counter-top ironing board as a station, with my keyboard and mouse on it.  I do not currently use a desk, so a lot of my review comes from my mouse committing suicide every time I move so I just had to buy a new mouse."
3.0,"Didn't work as well as I hoped, probably because of distance to cover.  Picture was snowy and kept cutting out so I went ahead and got a 50ft cable."
3.0,Good price but it make little bit unclear Screen
3.0,I like it so so...the case is fine for adults but not for the kids it's not protected good enough..and the ipad2 its to heavy to hold it up
3.0,I received that chargers last week and they charge my devices fine. The thing is that I was expecting that they would be able to connect to my laptop but I was wrong.
3.0,Good-looking Case.
3.0,"Not a bad product but it get heated, that probably means a low quality piece. Of course it work better in recent monitors models. Because in old models  you must do is adjusting the gamma, brightness and contrast levels"
3.0,"Ok, now considering the price point I shouldn’t be surprised but the eject button broke after its first use.  I popped a disc in.  Popped it out.  Popped another disc in then the eject button no longer worked.  Fortunately the eject button from my Mac worked just fine. Don’t really need the button on the device but still.  This is a very fragile piece of equipment.  Super light but it vibrates, I guess because basically the drive is cover by super thin super cheap plastic.  I bought it because I have an older version of Lightroom on disc that works just fine.  Adobe subscriptions are way too expensive but that is another story. And for this purpose this little drive is perfect.  Works great with Mac.  True plug and play but if you plan to watch a lot of DVDs or burn a lot of CDs this may not be for you. I don’t see how it would hold up.  If you just want to move some music or files from a CD rom on to your laptop this is great.  If you plan to use it pretty regularly, I don’t think this is for you.  I think it will break in about 6 months to a year with regular use."
3.0,"This was actually a bit different than the wheel from my G700. The outside of the wheel is a different color, and the &#34;freewheel / ratchet&#34; lever didn't work with my mouse. (It was a slightly different design)<br />I had to remove the one from the old mechanism and install it on this replacement.  After that, it works fine. The unit itself was easy to install.  Be advised this was not an &#34;exact&#34; replacement for a G700 as it is advertised. It requires finagling."
3.0,I got mine 2 weeks ago and it's working fine for me. Not sure if it's or not original but certainly the cable it's much thinner than the original one. So I doubt it's an Apple product and it looks like I will have to be extra careful when I carry it.
3.0,"Headphones are great, software probably sucks.  I wouldn't know, because I couldn't get it to recognize the device (I'm a windows software developer myself).  Luckily, the headphones work with just plug-n-play."
3.0,I got this to replace my regular system and frankly was disappointed.  I tried adjusting the picture but it just isn't as sharp.  The unit is just &#34;less&#34; all around.  For the inch or two of space you save it's not worth it.
3.0,"Love the case. Very pretty and durable. The only complain that I have is that the lowest slot of the case will note hold the tablet well. The tablet kept slipping out of the slot. So, I don't use the lowest slot much."
3.0,"There seems to be no review for 16&#34; version, so this must be the first one.<br />There have been many reviews on the quality, so I'll skip that part and focus on the size.<br />The dimension is 16x11x4. I've seen in Q&A that 14&#34; version's dimension is 15x11x4, so 16&#34; version is just &#34;slightly&#34; bigger than 14&#34; one.<br />The dimension exactly reflects its capacity.<br />My 14&#34; Dell latitude laptop barely fit in the laptop compartment, but velcro strap doesn't close. I'm pretty that sure any laptop even slightly bigger than this won't fit. I tried 15.6&#34; Dell inspiron into it, but, obviously, it didn't fit. I could squeeze it into the main compartment though.<br />In short, you cannot assure your 16&#34; laptop fit into this bag, which is advertised to be able to fit 16&#34; laptop.<br /><br />Overall quality is fine, but there are some other things I'd like to point out.<br />1. Attaching shoulder strap is hell. It's almost impossible to attach it with bare hands.<br />2. There's no tag or manual that I could make sure it's really 16&#34; version, or even if it is new product.<br />3. Shoulder strap is not really padded. I thought it's well padded based on customer images.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
3.0,Can't use it with most apps on my TV so still have to use remote to enter info on screen. Very frustrating!
3.0,it a USB hub like the on/off  buttons
3.0,"When it works, it works great & greatly improved my wireless speed from the ancient router I was previously using, but the thing needs to be restarted ALL. THE. TIME. So frustrating."
3.0,"This thing is super loud. I don't know, maybe I'm just used to my SSD. But yeah whenever this drive is accessed it is very noisy. My friend has the Blue version and it is very quiet and performance wise, I didn't really see any difference. I kind of regretted buying this one over the WD blue. if the blue came with more than 1TB I would've returned this one right away, but meh."
3.0,"Its probably not the batteries fault but I've been having a flickering power source problem. I bought a battery and a new charger. Charger works great, when I plug it in. Power goes through and hasn't blown up yet. But. When I put in the new battery, it does the same thing my old one did. The charge stops going into the battery and says &#34;charger not plugged in&#34; and my computer goes dim. If it was my charger, without my battery in, my computer would shut on and off, but has lasted 12 hours without a crisis while plugged in without a battery. then i put in the battery my screen turns  dim and the battery is losing power because it isn't plugged in. Maybe its my battery port? theres nothing visably wrong with it, I never tampered with it at all. Maybe i bought and have 2 defective batteries?"
3.0,It's a nice tablet but the battery went bad rtight after 30 days that I had to send in to ASUS service center for repair.
3.0,Came with installation instructions. Working as expected.
3.0,I got the warranty a month before I got the product. One would think you would start the warranty upon delivery of the product. Makes no sense to me.
3.0,good
3.0,1 of the 2 doesnt work very well.  You have to really push down to keep the connection.  The other works fine.
3.0,"Display port simply does not work. This is a well known issue with this model, and Dell has refused to admit there is a problem or offer a fix. This is the last Dell product I will ever buy.  Update: Display port kinda works most of the time. About once every month or so it goes on strike and refuses to work. After several power cycles, it usually returns to function. It does not install a lot of confidence in Dell monitoirs."
3.0,"This fits the ticket! It's really good at cooling down my laptop, draws the heat away easily and quickly. And so very quiet. The only thing I didn't like about this one was while it has adjustable supports for two positions so if you raise it to the higher position and move tit and/or the laptop the support legs comes out of their supports really easy. Not a good thing and kind of irritating at that. Other it does the job it's intended for very well indeed."
3.0,"I'm a bit iffy with this one for now.  I bought this card to use with my Gopro Hero 4, which is listed as one of the recommended cards on the gopro website.  When I went to use the card I was getting an SD card error and the recording would get corrupted.<br /><br />What I then had to do was format the card inside the gopro, while that was plugged into the computer.  The card is currently working in the gopro without the write error (for now).<br /><br />I am not sure if this is the standard with all Lexar cards, but I never had this issue with any other brand."
3.0,Takes a long time to charge..no clue why but it does. Took over night to get my battery up to charge. I thought that was on the first charge but it is still doing it. Not a big deal because the tablet stays home but annoying non the less.
3.0,"This was a case i had high expectations for. I was looking for a keyboard case that had the rotation ability and could also have the ipad be removed.<br />When i recieved this case, I found that the foam padding on the inside of the case pushed my ipad air out so that the bezels were exposed. The corners also had slight cracks in them. After only two weeks, all the corners now have cracks and have small pieces falling off. (I am not taking the ipad in and out of the case at all). The corner where the power switch/camera exists is the worst, with the whole corner breaking off in less than three days.<br />The rest of the case is perfect. The stand and the keyboard are holding up fine, but the rubber attachment doesn't seem to do a good job of holding the case together when not in use.<br />In its current form, I would not reccomend this case to anyone.<br />If they improve the ipad holding part of the case, I might consider giving it another try."
3.0,"This is a well designed bag and I have been very happy with it. My only complaint is that the dye from the leather rubbed off on my pants the first day I carried it using the shoulder strap - making it look like I was wearing very dirty pants. So I haven't used the shoulder strap sonce, which is a bit inconvenient and disappointing. Also glue is visible where the zipper meets the leather.<br /><br />All that aside, I really do like the setup of the bag and the leather feels well made. The laptop sleeve does not fit a realistically-sizes laptop, but I don't think any briefcases this size do. My 16&#34; laptop fits comfortably in the main pocket."
3.0,"I generally have problems with extra buttons on mice, so take it with a grain of salt if you are a button lover.  On this mouse, there are buttons above and below the place where the thumb rests.  The space between the buttons was a little too narrow, leaving me prone to accidentally press the upper or lower.  The mouse button below the thumb is assigned to the &#34;reduce volume&#34; command.  None of the buttons are assigned to the &#34;increase volume&#34; command.  I found myself lowering the volume accidentally.  There is no accompanying program to reassign keys, and even X-mouse couldn't touch it.  I note that you can't reassign the volume controls on Microsoft keyboards that have them, so you seem to be stuck with it."
3.0,Nice bag. Good layout and and lots of internal and external compartment areas. Two complaints.  One is the out side zipper sticks in one area but has not jammed. Two the strap is fixed and you must untwist it before throwing it over your shoulder.
3.0,I'm having concerns about  the volumn  It goes all the down to a faint whisper after a short time in use. I'm going to use it to watch something at length and see if this continues.  If so I will return it for a new one. If this is necessary I will need a return label sent to me as I don't have a printer. Will be in touch.
3.0,"The case does its job of protecting against scrapes/scratches/etc.  However, after using it for about a month and a half the rubberized feet have come off and I've had to hot glue them back on.  Three out of the four have come off in the past week, so I'm anticipating the 4th one to come off soon enough.  Without the rubber feet the case is pointless, because I have a granite countertop and the computer will slide off without them.  Also, If you wear lotion this is not the case for you.  It shows EVERY bit of oil or lotion on the case that rubs off from your skin."
3.0,"So I bought this pen thinking I was going to be buying a Porsha and because I listened to my intelligent brother (that's sarcasm my fellow reviewers), I ended up with a Nissan, a worthless piece of exsistant metal/plastic. I knew listening to my brother wouldn't be the smartest thing to do .... since he came out of the closet but I just felt I had to give him a second chance for some brotherly advice.<br /><br />Well let me just tell you, it has a horrible delay response time, like those types of delays when your trying to buy yourself time in the bathroom to shop on Amazin in secret, so that you have some piece and quite away from your family and shop without having you hair pulled or something stuffed in your ear.<br /><br />It's a great pen, I recommend it for any graphic designer with a brother like mine. I am wrapping this up and giving it to him for Christmas!"
3.0,"First, gotta say the mouse works fine - after I put another battery in it ( the one it came with was dead), nice shape clicks fine.  However, I did think I was ordering a BLUE mouse with a water transfer design, instead I got a REALLY RANDOM COLOR/ design!  I received a green and white mouse with some blurry crappy graphics.  So plan on something surprising if you order...."
3.0,It is a bit too bulky!
3.0,It's definitely not smudge proof. I'm having to clean it all the time. and I'm using a stylus 95% of the time.
3.0,"This mouse does its job and helps with overuse wrist pain. It is a tad light so it takes getting used to it moving so quickly across the mousepad. I'm not a huge fan of the auto sleep, requiring you to click a button to turn it on after a delay in use. I have another wireless mouse that doesn't do that. But really can't do much better for this price. Other vertical nice are way more expensive."
3.0,"I was very excited about purchasing this for my son's tablet. When I received it, the case was in it's packaging but when I opened it it had dirty spots on the back and the front..... It makes me wonder if it had been used and returned.. Not cool! Other than that so far we have not had issues but my son has not dropped the tablet yet either."
3.0,"I am not sure if it is the board or another part that needs replacing.  The tv has always been left on all the time.  One day it just went out.  After replacing this board, it comes on for a split second and is gone again.  If anyone knows something I missed let me know."
3.0,"Works well but too short to use on a portable battery, I reccomend the 6 inch cable."
3.0,"Works fine as a cover, but not as a stand"
3.0,Good hard drive but not worth the price. Segate offers a 5TB  external HDD (over twice the space) on amazon for $125: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKFEEBW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER<br />This HDD should cost no more than $60.
3.0,It's OK.  The earplug does not work.  Neither have I been able to connect it to an HDMI device.  It turns on in no time.
3.0,It has several glitches and the battery life is not very good but its still very good for the money.
3.0,"does not fit well into usb port, just a bit too short"
3.0,Didn't know that there was not a camera in this Ipad.
3.0,Love it
3.0,The noise is too much and I can hear weird mechanical sounds coming from the pump at higher rpms.
3.0,"Had some issues with this as the first two were defective and had to be returned.  I purchased a third one to give it a shot and so far so good.  Return policy is good, like being able to just have the shipper pick it up.  Rough start, but I have always like WD so I will continue to purchase their products."
3.0,"If your computer is 13.3 inch, don't buy it. I recommend you to take the 14 inch one.<br />It's true that it is 13.3 inch, but this is the exterior size of the product. The inside size is 13 inch, so a 13.3 inch laptop won't fit in it. Be aware of this.<br />So, My advice is if your laptop is exactly the size of the sleeve, you should go for a bigger one."
3.0,"When you first look at this Dell keyboard and mouse set, it appears to be nothing special, and you wonder why the combo is currently selling for $50.  Like so many other sets, both the keyboard and mouse have on/off switches, and the batteries for both are included.  (The batteries in this set, though, are suppose to last for 12 months. They are standard Duracell.)  The keyboard weighs 15.8 ounces and is 17 inches long.  The mouse weighs 3.1 ounces and is four inches long.  Both seem to be made of very thin plastic. The keyboard is comfortable enough to type on, but I don't think it's elevated enough in the back for comfortable extended use on a flat surface.  The mouse wheel is loose and smooth.  The combo uses a Logitech USB plug, and the drivers quickly installed on my laptop, after putting the plug in a USB port on my Toshiba.<br /><br />That USB plug can also be used in other devices, such as a TV, and that is why this keyboard and mouse set is different from many others.  As the description states, it is a multimedia set; which means it has dedicated media keys other keyboards do not; such as play, pause, fast forward and reverse, as well as three volume ones.  It's like the [[ASIN:B005DKZTMG Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad, Black]] or the [[ASIN:B00IICMUWS Microsoft Wireless All-In-One Media Keyboard (N9Z-00001)]], only this Dell has a mouse and not a touchpad.  Also, the Logitech 400, which I own, does not have as many dedicated media keys as this Dell, but the Microsoft one does. (Another keyboard you may want to look at that does have all the media  keys is the [[ASIN:B003VAGXZC Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 Combo]]).<br /><br />I tried the Dell plug in my LG Google TV,  which turned out to be the same exact plug as my Logitech keyboard plug, and the up and down keys, volume keys, play and pause keys all worked.  But the fast forward/reverse ones did not work on a show in my Amazon library.  The media keys also worked with  my Toshiba DVD Player, although I did not try the fast forward and reverse ones. When it comes right down to it, though, I prefer not to use media keys on a keyboard, but my TV remote control, or the media controls on a laptop or screen.  Also, when using a keyboard with my Google TV, I want a touchpad, not a mouse, which is why I got the Logitech 400. Thus, I'm presently not that impressed with this Dell keyboard and mouse combo.  But, one day in the future, I may get a device that will be perfect for this set.  (And Dell desktops and laptops are still my very favorite computers!)a DVD Player, although I did not try the fast forward and reverse ones.

3.0,works well
3.0,There isn't too much to say about a battery: it fits the hole (the original doesn't any more due to swelling);  it accepts a charge and gives it back when you unplug the computer.  This one does those things.
3.0,"Simple to use.  I like that it comes with additional foam pads.  This is not the best product for use with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 - 4th generation because it partially blocks the rear facing camera.  The FDX is also thinner then previous Kindles so the extra foam pads helped to anchor the tablet into the Ipow adapter.  With that said, as a Kindle Fire HDX 7 and 8.9 user/owner I would purchase this product again."
3.0,Bought this for someone who didn't know how to use a device. But they use it all the time!
3.0,works well; but keeps dropping out of computer
3.0,"It's okay. I don't think i would buy it again though. It's a good buy if your looking for a case, but nothing fancy. Just mediocre."
3.0,Stopped working after 3 months but before that did the job.
3.0,"It works great, looks nice just like the picture, and hasn't had any technical issues so far, but the braided cover is already wearing out after only a couple of months. It's normal with other iPhone cables (even Apple brand) that I've ever owned to wear thin around the connectors from repeated stress from bending,  pulling, etc., but never so fast! By getting a braided cable I was expecting more durability than the original plastic/rubber one. I bought a Tech Armor brand braided cable in the same length at the same time and have used them both equally, and the Tech Armor one is not showing any wear at all."
3.0,Does what was intended.
3.0,The laptop was great but the left side buttons did not work when arrived!
3.0,Underwhelming. I like it. Just not as much as an IBM.
3.0,I have used this product for a couple of months with an SSD on Windows 7 with no problems. When I recently upgraded my PCs to Windows 10 I started having problems - the drive would periodically stop working and hang any applications accessing it. I would have to disconnect it and reconnect it and sometimes a reboot was necessary.This was happening on both a laptop and a desktop.<br /><br />I thought this was a windows 10 issue initially and tried every solution that I could find but to no avail. I finally removed the SSD and placed it in another enclosure from a different manufacturer and have not seen the problem since on either PC. Not sure if there's some chipset incompatibility but I was using the latest and greatest drivers and BIOS on both machines.
3.0,"OK, but didn't suit my needs."
3.0,"The plug doesn't stay connected, but it does work.  I had to tape it to the desk so it doesn't move and become disconnected."
3.0,"Just a regular keyboard nothing really amazing, flat laptop type keys, cheap though that's the best part"
3.0,"I liked the cover, and it's pretty much as described. I ordered the pink and it is pretty true to the color in the photo but there are a couple things I did not like. First of all I have the A1502 model and the keyboard cover is not exact with the actual keyboard which is disappointing. I would also like to add that the cover has a small iBenzer logo on the lower right corner of the top part of the case which is not featured in the pictures."
3.0,It is way to heavy and bulky.  I blame myself because I didn't research enough.
3.0,it does not fit fully with the Otterbox Defender / mini Ipad. I have to make sure that the mini Ipad case is in a perfect center otherwise during the action will fall down...
3.0,"Even though I generally use android tablets, I wound up returning this and bought an Ipad Air 2. At the end of the day, I was pretty displeased with the premium price tag, but poor build quality. I actually went through multiple exchanges and found all sorts of issues. One unit had the loose rubber backing. Another one had huge amounts of screen bleed. Another one came damaged on arrival. All in all, I was very disappointed. Lollipop did seem promising however."
3.0,"good overall - fits my hand better than smaller mice<br />nice fabric covered cord, variable DPI<br />bad: buttons start going flaky in less than a year - would probably only last a few months if I was a gamer"
3.0,Loaded with Win 10.  Had to go to support web site to figure out how to make Bluetooth the primary audio.  Finally figured it out<br />and product works fine.
3.0,This particular case just didn't hold up very well. I ended up buying a second one that was a different make and model.
3.0,"The case fits the Ipad Air 2 great and works well with the auto wake and sleep function. I didn't think I cared about whether or not the interior was microfiber, but the matte rubber finish on the inside leaves marks on the screen. The marks are basically the fold lines of the cover. The marks are not damaging and can be wiped off, but when your screen is dim, those lines can be kind of annoying. I returned this one for the gray."
3.0,Nice product and does what it is suppose to. Only problem I have with it is that it's hard to plug charger and headphones to it.
3.0,"Looks great with lots of pockets.  Extremely stiff leather, so difficult to use."
3.0,The cable stopped working after several months like all lightning cables.
3.0,"The case is nice looking and fits well but my gripe is that the opening for the headphone jack is pretty small.  You need to make sure your headphones have a straight, slim profile around the jack otherwise they wont plug in all the way. The Apple headphones work fine, but others with a thicker surround for the jack, or an L-shaped connector, won't work properly."
3.0,"For some reason, it made my system slower... However, they gave me a refund and it was easy to return."
3.0,"It's just okay, even considering the price range.  The battery life is less than 2 hours.  The screen is only viewable from a limited range of angles.  The speaker output is pathetic.  But, it does at least work, and it offers a decent operating system and specs for the price.  If you just need a tablet to do the absolute minimum with, this will work.  Just don't plan on doing much before having to charge it again.<br /><br />The processing is pretty slow, though netflix runs just fine.  I would recommend the iRulu x1 over this.  The two tablets are pretty even in slow processing, weak speaker output, and storage capacity, but at least the x1 has a beautiful screen that is not grainy and can bee viewed from a wide range of angles.<br /><br />Really, the only reason I gave this product three stars is that it works, and it is dirt cheap.  Also, don't expect any help from the tablet's producer.  I emailed them looking to find out what screen protector to buy because the original one scratched up easily.  They told me that they do not produce any screen savers for the tablet, which is ridiculous considering they sell the tablet with one installed.  I asked for a way to contact the actual manufacturer of the tablet (since the customer service from the distributor was an aggravating joke) and never got a response.  Basically, expect NO customer service or support,  This is basically a disposable device, and I reviewed it as such."
3.0,"I was hoping for a more authentic feel.  Still, it's not bad and certainly better than any other stylus I've used."
3.0,i have to reset letters  almost every other page  they keep changing other than that its ok
3.0,"Slightly too large for the T420i and T420 I put them on.  They do seem fine otherwise, but again are too large side-to-side."
3.0,after a month it kinda dies fast but it worked
3.0,"Tested with AirPort Extreme (ME918LL/A) -- the adapter only supports 5GHz channels with lower numbers (36, 40, 44, 48), which effectively cuts by half the amount of channels AirPort can choose. This is not stated anywhere, and from the first sight it appears as if the adapter just doesn't work. It's good that I have some neighbors with 5GHz networks working on different channels, some of which could be seen by the adapter, so I decided to experiment with choosing the 5GHz channel on my AirPort and made it work with the adapter. I would expect better compatibility with Apple wireless router from a product &#34;designed for Mac&#34;. Real Apple devices support all the channels offered by AirPort Extreme and doesn't require tinkering with settings."
3.0,"Power supply cord could be tighter works sufficiently ,"
3.0,"Works ok. It's supposed to be the same 12W as the original I got with my iPad, but it doesn't charge nearly as fast, but it serves it's purpose for me to carry with my work bag & be able to leave my iPad charging for a few hours while I'm not using it at the office. Doesn't charge much at all when using the iPad compared to the original Apple adapter though."
3.0,Functions but the tripod setting you see is the only one you get. Makes it more awkward to try with than the ones where you can choose which bend point to angle the iPad at.
3.0,Battery doesn't last long
3.0,"Need updated wiring harness, I had to use adapters"
3.0,"The faux-leather material which makes up the outer cover is held on by an adhesive. The adhesive had already begun to fail on one of the inside corners when I took it out of the box. It wasn't a deal breaker, but it got annoying being reminded of the loose corner every time I held the tablet. I ended up selling it to a co-worker who didn't mind the defect. I really liked the aesthetic of it. It is &#34;adult&#34;, if you will, compared to most others. My favorite thing about this cover is that it ages well. I bought it because a friend of mine had one for a few years and over time the edges fray and fade a bit, and it takes the look of something more like an old leather-bound book than an electronic device. Too bad I got a bit of a lemon."
3.0,"Just received this monitor and hooked it up. They provided all 3 cables which was nice. This monitor does have speakers built-in which are so-so but I use external speakers anyway. Everything seems great, EXCEPT when I tried to lower the brightness, I hear this high pitch whirring sound. Has anyone else had this problem? If the brightness is anything lower than 98 (out of 100) I hear a high pitch sound. Very odd. I'm contemplating sending it back, unless I can solve this problem.<br /><br />Thanks."
3.0,Quite bulky but the packaging was nice
3.0,Awesome lights and I love the color.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the switch placement is terrible for use with most motherboards.
3.0,This was easy to mount and my 10&#34; tablet fits well in it. The tablet fits well into the holder but then the holder doesn't really lock into place. Rather it just kind of slides into this thing that holds it. Not a bad buy for the price but I wish it was just a bit safer.
3.0,When you fold this  to stand on its own it collapses  and is not sturdy enough to hold it up!
3.0,"The product is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but still works decent. I bought it to hold my Kindle, but I find that the case makes the Kindle too big to fit into this stand easily. I have to &#34;prop&#34; the kindle on the lip of the holder instead of rest it in the cradle. Same thing with my iPhone. Also, because the stand is so short and most of my products have to balance on the lip of the cradle, it makes my products very &#34;top heavy&#34; and they sometimes flip over backward or will suddenly slide off the front of the stand.<br /><br />On the plus side, the small stand doesn't take up a lot of space and it does come with a nice velvet storage bag."
3.0,The wheel just snapped while using a few months ago. It does not fit very well into my hand but its better than a few others that I have used. Bought it on sale for around 15$ so cant complain I guess
3.0,A bit flimsy and  i thought what i saw next to it was a styllus otherwise it was ok
3.0,"I bought this because I recently bought a 13.3 laptop that is super thin. I wanted something sleek and compact that would fit into a laptop sleeve without the bulk of a traditional mouse. The concept is good, but it freezes while trying to use it. For me, it's a little too aggravating. I'll be on the lookout for something more reliable. Probably going to return this one - even though it was a pretty good price."
3.0,This mouse is super easy to use and fits my hand well. The only complaint I have is the short(ish?) battery life - I've already had to replace my battery and I'm fairly good about turning it off when I'm not using it.
3.0,The micro SD is functioning as expected.
3.0,"This case fits the MacBook really good and snug, however one of the corners broke off within a couple of months. I didn't drop or hit the laptop so I'm not sure how it broke off. Kinda wondering how well my MacBook is really protected."
3.0,Worked great nice buy
3.0,"Pretty, but does not feel like genuine leather"
3.0,You'll get about 9 months out of this cable before it becomes useless. I used it in my car every day before it suddenly stopped working. Now it constantly connects and disconnects your device every few seconds until you get tired of hearing that Apple charging noise and ultimately give up...
3.0,freezes unbearably
3.0,Product does not hold much.  Not enough pockets and what pockets it does have does not hold much.
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,little flimsy but it will do
3.0,Not sure but keeps unconnecting to my mac.  May be my mac not sure.
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,"I was really excited for this but i am quite disappointed. The sound quality is ok, not the best, i would prefer my iphone earphones than these!! It looks stylist but not as comfortable like what other people said, even though i have very small ears! Overall, its ok so so, bit the price is good"
3.0,I don't understand what is up with these chargers. I have bought probably 3-4 of them. They last about 3-6 months and then they don't work anymore.
3.0,I wasnt in love from the beginning and the low price made me even more wary. As I start piecing together the parts in the case I'm fumbled for a few minutes and then I discover a rivet thats was placed in such an area that it won't let the power supply sit back completely against the back of the case. It does have some good wire management features. The instruction card that came with it is a little slack one page both sides really just tells you how to put the drives in the trays and into the case. The optical drive door is extremely flimsy and has already snapped off from merely using the paperclip to manually open a drive while the pc was off. The Graphics card support was useless because my graphics card has components as well as a passive/active cooling mode switch that didn't allow a fit.
3.0,They need one of these for 12-13 inch laptops as to not have too much width and to have a smaller lip. The lip should also have some kind of padding. The legs on my product were not even either as if it was warped. Otherwise it's perfect.
3.0,Doesn't fit Fire tight enough to use front camera other than that it is OK<br />Did like the pen and stylus that came with it
3.0,It's a nice tablet. I got it for school and it works OK so far. The only thing is that it glitches sometimes and will randomly bring you to s voice which is annoying. Also the on and off button works only when it wants to making it difficult when you want to turn it off. Lastly it takes crappy pictures by that's not super important.  All in all its ok especially for the price.
3.0,"After my Plantronics GameCom 780's broke (literally snapped in half) I decided to go a different route with my gaming headset. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones, and ran this mic through the coil of cable.<br /><br />The Good: The mic clips to the headphone cord and holds itself there securely. You never have to worry about positioning it, because it's always hanging by your mouth. Also, the cord is VERY long, so I had no problem connecting to my computer.<br /><br />The Bad: There are little clips on the wire that are designed to grip the cord. This is all well and good, but works terribly on a coiled headset. They turn into little barbs that grab the cable and bunch it up in weird places. You can't cut them off because they are fused to the plastic of the wire. Not a deal breaker for everyone, but annoying to coiled wire folk.<br />Also, the audio is not great. This should not come as a surprise to you, since it is a tiny mic, but the sound is very thin and not bassy at all. It does the job, but does not sound particularly good. If you talked into a webcam mic, you are getting basically the same sound.<br /><br />It's a very ok microphone, and the price is good, all things considered. But I am currently looking into getting something a little more robust."
3.0,Not fit 100%
3.0,"It's a nice case honestly. It's good protection, has a secure strap to hold the drive and extra netting to hold any memory cards, flash drives, small cables, ect. It's just seriously huge. It's bigger than your hand. I mean it was my own fault for not looking closely enough at the dimensions and I'll keep it and use it. I just wish it were smaller."
3.0,This item is made of nice quality. My iPad mini fits perfectly and snug. It is quite difficult to use the handle because the holder does not stay folded open. I still need to grip the other end of the ipad with my fingers when trying to read in bed which gets tiring. The handheld feature would have been great if there was a way to keep the case open.
3.0,"It works fine. Nothing too fancy, but we have no problem using it for some simple games on computer."
3.0,"It feels cheap, but it does the job. If you need a cheap drive to plug into your computer, here it is."
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,Lasted exactly one year.
3.0,1 Faulty controller but they replaced quick. However batteries die very quickly. Analogs don't respond right away. And triggers already started going bad. Not bad for a cheap back-up. But would recommend buying an official ps3 controller for quality. This just enough to get by.
3.0,Have the G400 and needed a mouse for my second computer. Logitech claims the G402 is a new and better version of the G400... Dirty little liars.<br />The quality does not reach its predecessor. The scroll wheel is louder and feels cheap. The buttons feel cheaper as well.<br />The shape is not ergonomic at all...<br />It might be a decent mouse but not what Logitech promised.
3.0,"Monitor arrived on time, well packaged, and in good condition.  Setup was easy and I checked it out using my desktop DVI output and laptop HDMI output.  Both worked ok.  It was a little cumbersome switching the monitor input between DVI and HDMI using the monitor menu.  The only reason I didn't give the monitor five stars is that it does not have a height adjustment.  My old Dell monitor did and I even tried to switch the base from the old one to the new one.  But, of course, a slightly different configuration made that impossible.  The height adjustment is important to help reduce neck pain."
3.0,"While it works, when i use it, other people hear themselves echo back at them. when i switch to the adapter that came with the MS product, the echo disappear OR when i mute myself, the echo disappears on their end. Not sure why this happens with this cable."
3.0,I'm glad I purchased it but I'm having issues with the volume. I have to lower the volume almost all the way down to get it at a reasonable level. It's annoying but manageable so it's worth the money to get it.
3.0,I canceled this item before planed this order.
3.0,"Be careful about this case. It does not provide much room for the micro-USB / HDMI / audio cables to be plugged in. If there's any sort of casing or plastic around the ends of the cables, you'll have to break/shave it off to get it in there."
3.0,"For the price you cant expect more, fits most 7&#34; tablets and feels ok, but the keyboard wiring is horrible, thee is no way to hide it."
3.0,"As much as we've liked previous Kindles, this particular variety does not support games which I didn't realize when I bought it. The children like to play crossword puzzle and other word games. Currently only 2 of my 3 children have that capability though they have similar Kindles."
3.0,Came charged to ~70%. Did not take very long to fully charge to 100%
3.0,"Comfortable, stylish, but it's a little over priced. It's not as big as I expected it to be. My backpack from Wal-Mart can fit more stuff in it. But overall it's decent."
3.0,"Just not very good on OS X. I have always noticed the same issues with Logitech and OS X which is jumpy/jittery motion. Maybe I am too picky, but as much as I dislike the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse, it shows the fluid motion that all mice should have. For a $100 mouse I really wanted to like this, but I do a fair amount of photo touch ups, and this Logitech mouse just does not cut it.<br /><br />Yes, I updated everything blah blah blah lol<br /><br />I will be returning to the store I bought it at tomorrow."
3.0,"Looks beautiful and I get a lot of compliments, but it is super heavy and only fits a laptop and some pens. Cords and a mouse make it bulky, and forget about trying to carry extra folders or other office items. You need another purse or bag for that. This is literally just a laptop briefcase."
3.0,"Decent while it lasted, then about 4-6months of ownership, the left button just stopped being springy, would engage click randomly. Mouse is useless now."
3.0,I gave it 3 stars since it is a nice cable but it does have flaws. The actual connection is to long so it fits awkwardly into the micro usb port. Also it DOES NOT SUPPORT QUICK CHARGE. If your phone features the qualcomm quick charge 2.0 don't get this cable since it will only do a standard charge. Spend a little extra and get one from a brand called anker.
3.0,I would give it a 5 star if back and was not so difficult to click
3.0,"This worked fairly well in a 1,600 square foot home.  Not quite so well in a 3,800 square foot home.  I.e., I'd recommend buying this if you don't need it to reach that far, but go with something more robust if you're in need of longer distance performance."
3.0,there aren't fade options for individual colors and remote range sucks. Besides that it's pretty good.
3.0,Buyer beware. This is not oem. It is a very cheap knock off.
3.0,"The link to activate the router didn't even work anymore! I had to call their call center overseas in order to manually install the router. It works great now that it's set up, but what a pain!"
3.0,"My only issue  resolution not what is said, and camera but its for my daughter so ...lets see how it goes"
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,50/50<br />We have purchased 12 of these over the last 9 months and 5 of them are still working great and 4 of them fell apart within 30 days of purchase. For the price they are great but the quality could be more consistent.
3.0,"It's cheap. Falls off sometimes but the real problem is the material. It's a fingerprint magnet! After a few ours of use, it looks horrible. You'll need a microfiber and cleaning spray to clean it off."
3.0,Looks like the original and works fine too. No complaints.
3.0,"Nice keyboard for typing, but not for coding.  The arrow keys as well as the  insert, delete home, end, page-up, page-down keys are half sized and not in the 'standard' location.  I knew this going in, but didn't think it would be as distracting as it is.  I've had the keyboard for over a month and I just can't get used to it.  It really needs to be about three inches wider to accommodate full sized keys.  Other than that, this is a good keyboard.  The keys have just the right amount of resistance and the travel is satisfactory.    I haven't tried it with gaming, but I'd suspect that it would not compare favorably with a real gaming keyboard."
3.0,"nice compact fast drive, quality and fits tight.  However it gets very hot in my laptop even after short use.<br />Also for some reason certain USB port no longer &#34;sees&#34; it after a few uses."
3.0,"To thick and bulky for me, but color was good"
3.0,I've only had it for a month.  It works. well enough.  Give me a year and half beyond warranties and I'll really let you know.
3.0,cord is a little short and flimsy but ok.
3.0,"okay product, however for me.  the desk edges were sharp when leaning your arms on the desk when typing on the computer.  there wasn't very many beads for the stuffing so it didn't balance as well as i would have liked.  the computer does get in the way of the light & cup holder, however, the light does bend.  the price was too low to bother with contacting the seller regarding a return so this is not a reflection on them.  The seller sent the product in an appropriate timeframe."
3.0,It's OK a bit of problem to put on. Left some bubbles. For the most part it gets the job done.
3.0,"USB ports work well, but every time I plugged in my phone (not apple) to any of the ports, including the charging port, an obnoxious high pitched sound was produced."
3.0,"Installs easy and works as advertised, however the display is pretty small which makes it hard to see the time from the couch"
3.0,"Worked really well with daily use for a year, then the zipper broke."
3.0,good
3.0,"I normally don't don't buy items that don't have reviews, but I took a chance.  I have only had the cover for less than a day, so this rating/review is not on the durability of the cover.<br /><br />First off, I purchased two of theses cases (pink/dark blue) for an iPad mini 3, which it is advertised for (as well as the 1 and 2).  Though you can put the 3 series in this case it really is NOT I repeat is NOT  designed for the iPad mini 3.  The only reason I say that is because the home button is covered so you can not use your finger print to unlock it.  You can see this in the picture, but I thought they might have been smarter than me and turned it into a flap so you can have access.....sadly they weren't....awww!!!  I have tried even pulling back the cover but because the hard plastic circle opening is not wide enough, you the fingerprint is distorted by being stretched out as you push down over the button (that is the best way I could think to describe it).  Apple was smart enough to as allow a password (yeah  Apple!!) so you can still use this cover without accessing your print.  If it wasn't for Apple allowing a password, it would be going back, but I still dropped stars for that.<br /><br />Secondly, I have the Otter Box Defend for my phone (totally amazing) so I wanted some like that for the iPads.  The Defend series for the Otter Box has a built in screen protector which is very nice, so the 3 in 1 title threw me off thinking that maybe it had the screen protector on it.....maybe I should do more reading and less thinking....It does not.  It does have a hard plastic bottom and top part with a rubber cover with no screen protector.<br /><br />Now for the cover and estimated durability....well lets just say I received it today and online shopping for a replacement.  I am keeping it because yes it is better than nothing.....it is just okay , but<br />1) the rubber cover doesn't seem to fit as tightly as it should,<br />2) the inter plastic casing doesn't seem to be very strong, and even though it is snap together there is a movement when you push on the thin sides of the cover (which doesn't happen with the my Otter Box case on my phone.) Though most likely you would not be doing that anyway unless you pick it up by the side.<br />3)  the rubber cover to the components (ear phone jack/ charging port) though thick, it does not lay down well or tight so it can pull up easily then also can also lift the rubber covering.<br /><br />I will also  mention it DOES NOT seem to have a strong odor, but it does have some if you put your nose up to it.  I have decide to mention this because some people have reported other cases have a strong smell....this case did not bother me.<br /><br />I hope this review has help and (maybe made you smile)."
3.0,Colors not as pictured! Hard case is nice bright yellow. Soft case is kind of a sickly yellow. Mouse is orange.
3.0,"Great little flash drive that doesn't take up a lot of space. Cheap.<br /><br />Beware, it gets hot."
3.0,ok
3.0,I love it
3.0,I'm using this on a Mac to reclaim data from old discs.  It works but I can't leave the USB cable plugged in to the MBP as it keeps cycling on and off continuously.  I am able to read the old disks ok.
3.0,"Not the most nicest one but for the price, I can said anything bad. I found an issue to install the SD and Graphics Card GTX 960. I have removed the plastic cover where the SD goes in order to keep wires pressing against the card. The 2 fans with lights by the side was a great idea but there are so many opens that there is not vacuum inside the case."
3.0,was hoping it would make my hulu and netflex work faster and not cut out as much.
3.0,"Not as great as I was expecting it to be. I still kept it as I hope I will adapt to it, but so far it is awkward to use."
3.0,"This keyboard is not a bad.  It does have a couple things wrong with it.  The letters on the keys are fading now after about 1 year of use.  Also, I didn't think the location of the question mark key would bother me that much, but I was wrong."
3.0,"I love the print on this case, however it is not what I expected. It's not sturdy and it seems it would break quickly. I also noticed that there is no magnet to help the cover stay closed."
3.0,"I have had my Kindle Fire for a while and I do enjoy reading on it and watching Amazon programs, it has been a real disappointment in terms of the service I have received for and ongoing problem. I downloaded the Tumblr app from the app store on the Kindle, but I have been unable to login. Each time I try to log in it says that it &#34;can not connect to Tumblr. Check connection and try again&#34;  I checked my connection. I am able to use the internet on all of my other kindle apps except that one.  When I called &#34;tech&#34; support, first I kept getting disconnected, then I received a call back from what looked like a local number and started talking to someone called &#34;Harry&#34;.  He asked if he could dial into my computer. He did a check and did a netstat test and said that we had &#34;strangers&#34; on our home network and they could clean up out home network for $149.  He claimed that that was why my Tumblr app wasn't working! Here is the transcript from the dial in work with the price:<br />name:Lorenzo Marco Savona<br />email:lorenzosavona@me.com<br />tumblr<br />please hung phone i will call u back<br />ok<br /><br />please call us back on 1-877-937-1377 and ask for harry<br />ok<br />30 to 35 min<br />$149.99 two year<br /><br />tech roger<br />www.techroger.com<br /><br />I find this outrageous!  And still my problem is unresolved.  I am unable to reach anyone at Amazone Kindle Tech support who can help."
3.0,screen protector does help with glare.  the problem with this product is it's slightly too big.  I would trim a couple millimeters off the side and end to make install easier.  hard/ impossible to get all the bubbles out because it covers the screen entirely.  product should be made slightly smaller.  no need to cover every micron of your screen.
3.0,"I like the size and weight of the bag.  I use it 5 days a week and carry all my office gear easily. 13&#34; and 15&#34; laptop plus 1 power supply.  I like that there are 2 smaller pockets under the flap. I use those for a note book and pin, and umbrella.  The straps are easy to adjust.  My negative points are the 2 snaps failed in the last 30 days. (just short of having this bag for 1 yr).  When I say &#34;failed&#34; I mean they came lose and pulled out of the canvas cover flap.  So the 2 smaller pockets are not as secure."
3.0,"This is great as a protective cover for the tablet but, if using the screen cover to prop up the tablet its tough to put it together then when pulling apart it a pain. I cracked mine trying to pull it apart. It still works though."
3.0,"I waited over a month before submitting a review so I'd have a good idea about the tablet. I got this tablet so I could take care of business, such as email, blogging, internet searches, You Tube....I'm able to use all of these just fine. Of course the screen size doesn't compare to a laptop, but it's better than a phone. I like the travel size of the tablet. Pros: I can take care of business & even download numerous apps, it has plenty of space, I use it for Doulingo app, Bible app, Adobe PDF reader, Google hangouts/dialer (I can actually make phone calls on my tablet; voice & video calls) It has a front facing camera. If you don't have much to spend this will work for the basics. Cons: I noticed it takes hours to charge, (even when there is still 50% battery) I think it may be the charger that came with it? The volume isn't that great. The Sound Recorded app that came with it is worthless--you can hardly hear what you record & I haven't found any way to share the recordings. You can hardly see the screen at all when you are outside in bright sun. It's also hard to see a clear image from certain angles--if someone wanted to see screen with you. If you don't have a lot to spend this will work for most things. I'm thankful for it. If I needed something with good volume I don't suggest this product--unless you want to use bluetooth speakers or earbuds with it."
3.0,difficult to install especially when you have out of warranty netgear equipment (range extender).  Want $69 to assist...more than an extender costs.
3.0,"I do not know what this is, or even if or why I would have bought it????  It appears to be a battery for a laptop...  I HAVE bought two of these in the past and they are still working as well as should be expected. (so I bumped it up a coupla nothches)"
3.0,"It was OK, but it didn't suit my needs."
3.0,"Tried to return to amazon, and I received a &#34;health and safety&#34; risk, no longer returnable.  That sounds kind of scary. The speakers seem ok, but they buzz out of the right channel sometimes."
3.0,"This router is OK, but that's about it.<br /><br />It's an inexpensive router that you can use to run wireless (or wired) devices through that's super cheap. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The range being the major issue. Great for single room applications or small apartments, but not great for multi-floor or large homes with lots of walls to go through.<br /><br />Installation:<br />==========<br />It's pretty easy to get it up & running. I tested it in tandem with a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and a Motorola Surfboard (two separate locations). Plug an ethernet cord into your modem or router you're connecting this to, kick on the power & wait for the lights to light up.<br /><br />You can access the software via a wired connection or by connecting to it wirelessly. Default SSID is JCG xxxxxx. The default login & password are located on a sticker on the bottom. Once signed in, open your browser to 192.168.1.1<br />NOTE: Do this BEFORE you connect it to a modem or a separate router. Particularly if you're using it with another router. Otherwise the other router will assign it a different IP and you won't be able to connect.<br /><br />Once in, you can set the router up as a standard router, repeater, hot spot, or a couple other options.<br />I set mine up as a router.  While you're in the software, you can change your SSID to whatever you want it to be (FBI Van is always popular!) and can change the wireless login and password as well.<br /><br />Connecting once set up:<br />==================<br />Once set up, reboot it (usually does that when you apply the settings anyway), scan your wireless network for the router, and attach to it.<br />Here's the problem I ran into. If you're not within a couple feet of this thing it DOES NOT like to always connect.<br />iPhone 6 = Had a devil of a time connecting. It saw it, I put in the login credentials but it kept saying the password was bad. Walked up to the router w/ the phone in my hand and it connected. What the heck?<br />LG G3 = Fairly easy time connecting<br />Moto X (1st Gen) = Pretty easy time connecting<br />Moto G (1st Gen) = Fairly easy connecting<br />MacBook Pro 2013 = sometimes it'd connect, sometimes it wouldn't<br /><br />But then, get too far away from the router (say maybe 15 to 20 feet) and it'll randomly drop the signal.<br />I used a Wi-fi Analyzer on my LG G3 and found this to be the case. Over and over the router would drop it's signal and then come back.<br />All the while the other router in the building still had a solid signal (especially the Netgear Nighthawk--that thing rocks!)<br /><br />What was strange was that it seemed to go in waves too. And before you crucify me about channels, the other routers in the room I tested it with were both using separate channels far away from the channel this broadcasted on (Netgear broadcasts on 3, this was on 8. Motorola was on 4, this was on 8), so it wasn't channel interference. It legitimately would just &#34;drop&#34; it's signal and then come back.<br /><br />I even tested the router without it being attached to another router too. Yep. Same thing. It usually happened though when you were a good 15 to 20 feet away from it through a wall.<br /><br />However, when it was working, I could get a good signal from it a good 40 to 50 feet away...but again, then it would drop at random and you're now without a connection. Tried rebooting a few times, etc. But to no avail. Even tried repositioning it.<br /><br />Size:<br />====<br />It's quite a bit smaller than my Netgear Nighthawk (see pictures), but the Nighthawk is a beast! So size wise, the JCG has a much smaller footprint. The three antennae's on the back are pretty easy to adjust too.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />===============<br />If you need a super basic router and you're in a tight space (say a smaller apartment) or if you're going to use it in the same room, this is probably a great little bargain of a router. But if you need something that'll broadcast further (say down the hall and into the living room) and stay on consistently, I can't really recommend it for that. The signal just dropped too often for me to feel comfortable using it as my primary router.<br /><br />When it was on, it was pretty nice. Good, solid speedtest numbers, nice features, but it doesn't seem to like to broadcast very far away from itself and stay on consistently.<br /><br />* I purchased this router at a significant discount in return for a review *ast further (say down the hall and into the living room) and stay on consistently, I can't really recommend it for that.

3.0,"Works well enough. It does have some quirks. When I leave my system on and let it sleep it does have issues. The monitor blinks on and off, and you hear some kind of system notification sound as well. I am not sure what the problem is. It does switch the screens and USB keyboard/mouse as expected though."
3.0,This was an okay product but just a few months after it broke on me. I am disappointed with this product
3.0,300 screws and not a single one I need.  They are screws and they are tiny.  I have a Sony Vaio notebook and needed to replace a few screws that have fallen out over the last year.  The description says Sony so I ordered it.  Well none of the screws are long enough for the one I needed to hold the DVD drive in place.  I got screwed.  But there are a lot of them .
3.0,I have two different small solid state external hard drives.  This case is slightly small.  Perhaps I didn't read the description well enough.  Another 1/4&#34; in length and width and it would be great.  Barely zips shut and I'm a little concerned about the pressure its putting on the drive once it's closed.
3.0,Works OK
3.0,Seems to have great potential. Very well built. My issue is that it seems to not like special characters being used for preshared keys or passwords. Since its 2015 I find this very limiting. I need a travel device for an extra layer of security while using public hot spots. At least that way I am not on the same subnet as tons of other users. For the novice this device should be great. But there needs to be a firmware update to address this issue.
3.0,"I have tried every calibration scenario you can imagine and cannot get the gamma to appear as I would like.  The monitor is 3.5 feet away from me with the center at eye level.  It is at the lowest height adjustment the stand will allow.<br /><br />Trees in the background of any game are black blobs.  Movies are worse.<br /><br />I've adjusted settings on the monitor and through nVIDIA's control panel.  I've calibrated monitors for years and have never had this particular issue.<br /><br />When I stand up and look down at the monitor the image is perfect.  Sitting in front of it, terrible.<br /><br />I've contacted Samsung through their site, through the vendor I purchased it with and through social media.  No responses and I'm certain they would just walk me through settings which I've already tried.<br /><br />I can eliminate the &#34;black blob&#34; issue by adjusting the gamma, brightness, contrast and saturation through nVIDIA's control panel only.  No combination of settings (yes, tried Game Mode in those combinations, as well as dynamic contrast) makes a difference.  The problem is getting the nVIDIA settings to a point where I can see details in the trees washes everything else out and makes me feel like I am staring at the sun.<br /><br />This is not me not knowing the details of the various options.  This is just the only way I can get the details to pop out.  Youtube videos filmed in bright sunlit locations look like a candle lit speakeasy.<br /><br />Everything else about the monitor is great.  Sexy design, the jog button makes adjusting settings a snap.  The curve adds just enough immersion to make the difference between curved and flat screens worth the price of admission and though I don't use them, the speakers would do just fine in a pinch.<br /><br />Honestly though, I've never had so many issues trying to calibrate a monitor.  I would call it a gamma curve issue but I'm not sure why that would manifest itself in this way.  It is as if the viewing angle was designed to have me sitting 8 or 9 feet off the floor looking down at an average height office desk...lol.ngle was designed to have me sitting 8 or 9 feet off the floor looking down at an average height office desk...lol."
3.0,"I purchased this product through a computer store almost a year ago and it has been acting up since month 2. I keep my desktop on all the time and by the 3rd or 4th day, the device would stop working. No amount of unplugging or plugging back in or disabling/enabling or running the Windows troubleshooter would satisfy it. I would have to reboot the computer in order to restart the device. I just learned to live with it as annoying as it was when you have 33 tabs open in your browser, doing research. In the last 3 months, it started dying even faster, only lasting 1 - 2 days. Last night, it stopped working altogether and when I did a RESTART after it died, I got the Windows 10 Teal Screen of Death due to this device. I unplugged it and tested it on 2 other laptops and the device could not be initialized/recognized and it did not light up anymore. It also caused bizarre issues with my USB ports. I really like TP-LINK and have been enjoying a dual band router they produce without any issues. I plan on purchasing another TP-LINK, but a different model. I am thinking about the TL-WN8200ND. So, this product works great... when it works. I don't recommend it since it gave me trouble within 2 months and it's very unreliable. Thanks!"
3.0,Came charged at ~ 69%.  Did not take long to fully charge to 100%.
3.0,"The mouse itself is really cool looking, and the buttons are great. My main complaint is that after a month of use now whenever I scroll it shoots in the opposite direction. It's getting worse and more annoying. Unfortunately I now have to get another mouse."
3.0,I would have given the case a 4 if it allowed access to the SD card.
3.0,Pretty good.
3.0,"Why is it Logitech makes awesome keyboards and mice, but their headsets are just okay? Logitech, if you're reading this, you guys can do better. I always buy Logitech brand gaming peripherals, and while these are decent, I've already run into my fair share of issues with them, specifically the sound cutting out, and coming back on randomly. If you want a quality gaming headset, look elsewhere, if you want a budget gaming headset, these aren't too bad, but don't expect the best."
3.0,"The concept makes sense. It works as intended. However, it does NOT cover ALL USB plugs. For example, it does NOT  include the tiniest USB connector as required on some small cameras such as the Panasonic DMC-XS1."
3.0,"Haven't used it yet, but right out of the box noticed it was a three prong plug, not the two prong pictured.  Have just a couple places in my house where three prong won't work (extension cords to plugs behind furniture), so was looking for that specifically.  Dissappointing, but haven't decided whether it is a big enough deal to warrant time/hassle of exchange"
3.0,"The memory cards did not fit my camera. It was my mistake, no fault with the cards.  I wi;; be more careful next time.  Promise."
3.0,The speakers work very well But it randomly will start making popping sounds and the aux cord is not long enough in my circumstances
3.0,"The keyboard is nice, but the one I received was warped. It won't lay flat on a flat surface, even with the legs extended it still tidder todders as you type. Kind of annoying!"
3.0,This case makes the home button more difficult to depress.
3.0,"The product arrived on time, well packaged.  The unit is nice but previous reviews are correct. The light is REALLY hard to get out.  Resorted to getting pen out to get the light to pop out."
3.0,"Card is reasonably fast... when it works.  On my HP Pavilion + Win10 x64, the card produces BSOD (video_scheduler_internal_error) resulting in a needed restart pretty regularly when trying to use OBS to record video while playing video games, and during other video games as well (with or without OBS).  Latest drivers are in place, latest Win10 updates, and all the latest BIOS and drivers are in place on the PC so I think it's a driver issue.  I've also confirmed that no old drivers are lingering.  The error has been traced to a fault with the card accessing DirectX and then producing an invalid fence ID.  Various settings have been tried such as switching on multithreading in the 3D section of Nvidia Control Panel, etc. to no avail.  I would rate this card lower due to this problem because it makes playing video games unreliable and results in us getting banned for &#34;quitting&#34; mid game which is a major hassle, but I can't be 100% sure that the video card itself is at fault even though the prior card (9800 GT) works fine... but too slow to play many games."
3.0,Cheaper version of the Speck.  Lesser quality - already lost one of the &#34;feet&#34; on the base.  Doesn't fit snuggly around the computer.  Spend the extra money for Speck.
3.0,"Came on time. Seems to work fine. Fits my Galaxy S4. It says it only added 29.8GB, though. Not 32GB."
3.0,"Finally decided to upgrade my LG 24' widescreen lcd thats about 8 years old, and I have to say I'm not impressed. I know this is for console gaming but its also going to be used for a PC screen and watching netflix. For anything non-gaming this monitor is average to slightly below average. I'll keep this for my Xbox one but will be getting another monitor for general use I guess.  I know this is marketed as just a gaming monitor, I just thought since it had been so long since my last upgrade that things would look better, not worse, than my aging  run of the mill LG monitor.  Used with xbox one and windows 10 pc 4.5ghz  2500k with GTX 770 (Driver 355.60 - WHQL)   Edit: used d-sub input instead of HDMI for PC use and it looks a little better than my initial first impression."
3.0,no bad
3.0,Every so often either the sound or the whole signal will fail and this usually lasts from between 10 seconds and 1 minute. Also the picture seems to hesitate on occasion(lags) but that doesn't supprise me since this item did mention that in the remarks I read previously regarding the usb's original purpose which isn't for moving pictures but for data
3.0,is that really touch screen ???
3.0,just bought it and thought that it's touch screen but it doesn't
3.0,Useful but does not work the whole time
3.0,Too small
3.0,Build quality issues.  Blue tabs in plug are are more centered than they should be and one broke when I plugged a cable in.
3.0,Keyboard is impossible to program. Does not save my key color combinations. I don't think the drivers are updated and good luck finding where to update them. Weird clicking sound from the space bar. I very much dislike the size of the 'Enter' button. To small and I continuously hit the '\' button.
3.0,Be cautious of this company. They offer 'rebates for good reviews' and then never deliver. Any company offering something for good reviews is questionable in my opinion.<br /><br />Works as described. convenient size. I purchased it for with with a Raspberry Pi but works with my regular laptop and is convenient when working with a projector.
3.0,Good mouse pad for the money but if there are any small scratches on the feet of your mouse it will drag some of the fabric from the pad and catch the mouse. It is unbearable especially for a gamer. I shouldn't have to have picture perfect mouse feet just for this to work as intended.
3.0,I'm not sure that I can tell any difference in this cable and ones that are 1/2 the cost. they both work the same as far as I can tell.
3.0,"While I enjoyed Pencil when it worked, it didn't work for long. Shortly after the warranty coverage ended, the eraser sensor consistently failed - I still use Pencil as a stylus, but it's a dead stylus at this point - I don't even bother pairing it with Paper when in use. (For what it's worth - the same issue happened to my friend's Pencil.)"
3.0,"Purchased this a few days ago and like a lot of others has said, it does produce an incredible amount of ghosting. I've included a video. I use it mainly for development and occasional gaming so it's not *too* bad for me. However, the ghosting is significant. Other than that, it's a great monitor and does everything as advertised.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN9pzhxTCic<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />I ended up returning this monitor and purchasing the ASUS PB287Q. A lot better monitor and has zero ghosting!"
3.0,"sadly this hub didn't work for me.  for some reason, the hub can't kicking my usb items in and out of commission.  this got too annoying after a while."
3.0,"Material feels durable, but not confident that the screen will stay protected since my child can touch the bare screen through the case, instead of the case having plastic to avoid fingerprints and having something drop on the screen. May be returning this item."
3.0,Does the job. I find the keyboards move just a little during normal typing. This means they end up slightly different alignments and locations which makes it challenging to touch type. I may play around with some sort of bridge to tie them together or maybe an anti slip mat on my desk.
3.0,"The kindle is in good condition and works fine except I bought this kindle expecting it to have a backlight, as advertised, and there is no backlight! I'll have to return this, sadly."
3.0,No for gaming but may be for Photoshop. I have to return it but not because it was a  bad Graphic Card. My gaming PC needed something better or games will not perform as games requirements said.
3.0,"Works fine, but a bit noisy."
3.0,The quality is a pretty cheesy.
3.0,They should be more explanatory and function with alcanse of operation. for the countries where it can function
3.0,A+ seller...great product and good seller.
3.0,sometimes does not work
3.0,"I cut to fit an HP Envy Sleekbook 6Z-1100, wound up cutting it short ~3mm lengthwise, so I have these 2mm gaps on the left and right.  Not 3M's fault.<br /><br />When installed with the embossed &#34;3M FFMR15&#34; branding on the top edge readable facing me (as opposed to backwards), the privacy filter is ridiculously reflective, causing almost any light source behind you to create glare on the screen.  I installed the filter with the adhesive strips, but will probably switch to the tabs for easy removal when using my laptop in bright lighting.  I have not yet tried flipping the filter over, it may be that its anti-glare property is on the other side.<br /><br />Installation is straightforward, but it is easy to get air bubbles trapped in the adhesive strip unless you start at one end and carefully use a plastic card or similar to slide along the strip to press it down.<br /><br />Privacy is good; the filter starts to obscure information at about +/- 45 degrees, but someone sitting next to you doesn't have to lean  over very far before he/she can start to see information appear on the edge of your screen.<br /><br />3M put a HUGE trapezoidal notch in the top center of the filter, presumably for easy removal, but it's about the area of the end of my thumb.  Somewhat annoying."
3.0,Upon hooking up the cable from my TV's USB port and my Firestick. I started up the unit while it did power up I kept getting a warning message of low. I then swapped the cable out with a longer micro USB cable and used the same USB port on my TV. Result is no warnings. Swapping back again I received the warnings again. I do not know why I am getting the warning but the Fire Stick appears to work just fine. It does(the cable) help on clearing up the clutter so that is why I marked it with three stars.
3.0,"After a great length of time using the Ceton card, it has been more of a miss than a hit. When it works, it's awesome. The quality of the video is better than that of the cable box recording for HD content as wel as standard definition. Also, being able to record 4 HD shows at the same time was a great feature. However, the card would tend to lose connection often. Despite all the support that Ceton provided and driver updates, it never really solved the drop in connections. Only by rebooting the computer does it seems to reestablish a connection."
3.0,"Only charges to 6800 mAh, but good price and it works."
3.0,I bought this cover for the stand up feature which works well.  The only issue I have is that the cover does not stay in place when closed. I  carry my Kindle in a purse and sometimes find it glowing because the cover moved.  I'll use for a while but will buy the $40 leather cover which stays shut
3.0,Be nice if it worked with my USB 2.0 mouse to a USB 2.0 port.
3.0,Awesome. this way i can be gross and eat while using my computer at the same time. The texture makes it a little slower to type though.
3.0,"Way too noisy, cooling is very good. If you are a heavy gamer with gaming headphone set, you can simply ignore the noise."
3.0,Cheap but did the job during one year. Now it is falling a part and the USB connection is bad
3.0,I have the GTX3B 256gb version. So far I have found the read speeds to be fairly impressive but the write speeds have been disappointing.<br /><br />I can usually get about 300MB/s when I am copying a large file to another device but only about 70MB/s when I am copying from that same device. I have yet to see anywhere near the advertised speeds.
3.0,I like the computer. Purchased it a few months ago.  Now there is a charge on my credit card from Cybernet  for $29.95? I never signed up for any online gaming when I purchased this computer!
3.0,"Batter lasts forever, love the reference features.... but the processor is too slow for this device (minus one star) and you cannot read eTextbooks bought on Amazon (minus another)! eTextbooks apparently require a Fire, iOS, Android, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle app. If I would have known this I would not have bought this EBOOK READER. Very disappointed."
3.0,Very difficult to use and to find out how to transfer books from one kindle to another.
3.0,It's to easy to get what you don't want on the screen. I liked the old one better with the controls on the side.
3.0,Perfect for the price but they don't last long
3.0,"It's a great monitor! Everything looks amazing, especially games that support 21:9 (not many that do). I really love this monitor but there is one huge issue that will probably cause me to return it. The backlight bleed on this monitor is horrible! It is especially bad because most movies or games will have black bars on the sides and the backlight bleed is very distracting. It would be such an awesome monitor if not for the backlight bleed (or at least if it was a more minor issue). If it was cheaper I'd probably just keep it but at over $1000 there's no way in hell I'm keeping a monitor with so much backlight bleed.<br /><br />Edit: I sent back the first one and got a replacement. Less backlight bleed but still pretty bad, also the monitor is a bit wobbly this time. I don't know if I'm just unlucky or if this monitor will just always have this issue. It sucks because I really want to like this monitor but it's really making me debate whether I should just refund it or not. I'll probably try to replace it one more time and it it still has bad bleed issues then I'll just get a refund and wait for another company to release a similar product."
3.0,"After several months of CONSTANT resetting, I finally gave up.  I just simply could not waste another couple of hours resetting every week.  It works great when it does."
3.0,"First of all I normally DON'T give reviews but I had to. Its an OK card, really it is for the price but two problems: it has tendency to run very hot during gaming and its super loud like all the time unless its cold in my room then it runs quiet. I've had it over a year now and I wish I had discovered the cause of the noise sooner so I could send it back for a refund, too late now but no biggie for soon I will be buying me a new GPU anyway."
3.0,"Why reviews are bad is probably because everyone seemed to get their jot touch last year when adonit was still fixing problems with the iPad air 2. It works pretty good with it now if you have the latest model. Got my bluetooth to hook up pretty quick, I use Procreate and Adobe Sketch on my air 2. Pen pressure is okay, not the greatest but still workable. Overall it's a good stylus and I'm happy I got mine. I gave it four stars because it's not perfect. I don't believe there's a perfect stylus out for iPad air 2 yet, but as I said this is a good stylus to have if you want to draw now. Other reasons why it's four stars instead of five... When I draw on my iPad the lines cut short sometimes and the pen won't work right away after I tap the screen a few times. Maybe because I didn't set my pen to different writing styles... Be sure to set your pen to a writing style you prefer, it's always good to just play around with that. Also, when drawing, the pen won't come into contact with the screen if it's near the edge of the iPad. I guess Adonit is still working with other minor issues with that, be sure to check their blog for updates.  Edit: returning it because I don't think this is the latest one Edit 2: It's not the latest one, get it on their website instead. I was surprised that this version worked OK on the iPad Air 2 tho."
3.0,"The battery is working ok-ish, first time charging it & turning it on with the laptop. It's been 10 minutes & it's already at 88%.<br /><br />The battery indicator on the back of the battery does not work at all. It was one of the biggest reasons why I bought this battery.  Will keep updating<br /><br />Can I get an exchange for a working one?"
3.0,Times out sometimes.
3.0,"Cover is cute and durable, but the magnet that's supposed to put your iPad in sleep mode doesn't work. I have to remember to lock my iPad before closing the cover or it'll stay on and use my battery."
3.0,Mostly beneficial however there are some bubbles for sure
3.0,Its cute like the color and pattern. Fits the tablet fine but there is no hole for the charging plug without flipping the tablet upsidedown. Not a fan
3.0,had to return not satisfied with sound level
3.0,Face plate fell off
3.0,"worked for a while, comfy to the hand. the wheel however broke randomly and can not be repaired. pulled it apart to find the wheel is held in to the scroll sensor with a tiny piece of plastic. small piece causing a big problem. but still, for a $22 mouse, its not half bad."
3.0,"There's no clear way to do data transfer from my phone to my computer using the driver that comes with this device. Also, everytime I want to play music, I have to link on my phone and approve the connection on my computer. I have no way to make the connection automatic."
3.0,The cord on it is too short and I am going to get another one with a longer cord
3.0,The drive I received WAS NOT NEW. It was a repaired or refurbished drive.The original seal was broken and covered with a new one.<br />The drive works for now but I'm curious how long it's gona last.
3.0,"I got this monitor back in 2013. Luved it color , clarity everything was great.  About a month ago, it started acting up as in , out the blue for no apparent reason the screen would go dark. The power button would show on, but no picture. Sometimes I would cut it off with the power button, and cut it back on and it would go back to working. It had gotten to where it was becoming a frequent occurrence, I had checked my monitor cable, checked my graphics card, they were ok. Yet still the picture would go out, still had sound and could hear a video playing, but couldn't see anything. So I disconnected the monitor , hooked up another old monitor, and could see the picture fine.. That is when I determined it was the monitor for sure that was the problem. After reading some of the 1 star reviews, I see that this is a common problem with this monitor as other people have had similar problem."
3.0,Liked the product because it was easy to transport but had a hard time transferring my files due to lack of directions. They didn't come with my purchase. So I wasn't able to transfer everything to my hard- drive before it crashed on me 2 weeks later.
3.0,"At first I was very happy about this backpack, it's big and fits everything I need. I'm able to put an MSI Dominator GT 72 into the laptop slot just fine, along with my wireless mouse, ps4 controller, and other cords that I need. I also have my school supplies inside, like binders and notebook, calculators, pens/pencils etc. Two water bottles on each side because I spend all day at school (8/9am - 7pm) this thing is FULL! That part brings me to my next point.<br /><br />The bad part to this backpack is like other people have said, the stitching, and a little more I've found personally irritating. I've been using this backpack for 4 days (beginning of day 5 as of writing this review), and already I've noticed the stitching on the right shoulder strap coming loose.<br />So I'm becoming worried that this will not even last me the semester before it falls off my back and my laptop breaks inside. There is just so much reinforcement that I didn't expect it to start to fall apart so easily, or so fast. I have this backpack full, and it's heavy, so I need reliable durability...<br /><br />Another negative  is that the straps, no matter how loose or tight I let the backpack be, digs into my arms and armpits. I am soar from just walking around the university campus, and to and from school from home (a 20 minute walk). The tops of the straps are comfortable enough but I'm really hurting from the bottom of the straps where they end and turn into the adjustable part digging into me.<br /><br />So in short:<br />Pros:<br />-Fits everything I need<br />-17.3&#34; gaming laptop fits nicely<br />-Tons of compartments for organized people (like me)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Stitching immediately coming unthreaded after only a few days of use (I noticed on day 2 of use)<br />-Bottom of straps dig into your arms while heavily loaded"
3.0,Great product but sent me wrong color
3.0,"the only thing I dislike about this cable is the lightning end is larger than the oem one from apple, so its not compatible with my lifeproof case.  other than that, this cable does everything it is supposed to do"
3.0,not satisfied this product don't know how to put together.
3.0,Excelente
3.0,"good price, but nothing to write home about."
3.0,"It works, but sparks EVERY TIME I plug it in."
3.0,"Mixed feelings on this one. The case exterior is great, thick and very durable. Gasket is good, hinge is good, clasp it solid as a rock. The only problem is that it doesn't hold the SD cards firmly. When you open the case, at least one and usually three cards are flopping around inside. The case has two jobs: 1) protect the cards, and 2) hold the cards. It does #1 exceedingly well. #2, not so much. The picture attached shows what I usually see when I open up the case."
3.0,I'm not happy with how the light is attached to the cover. The picture did not give a good idea how it attached. I'm concerned that the flap that the light is attached to will wear out and actually tear from use and I'm also concerned that the band that holds the light when not in use will also tear or the snap will break out of the case.<br /><br />I was so happy with the original case with the built in light but the light stopped working and I was unable to get another like it. I would have never bought this one if I knew exactly how it was connected.<br /><br />I do like the magnetic closing of the cover.
3.0,"Nice basic tablet,easy to use and guick 3g ,but didn't realize it only had a1megapixel camera,wish it was more,but for basic use games internet,its pretty guick thanks!"
3.0,Feels really cheap. Literally feels like cardboard. The packaging was lame as heck too.
3.0,"Yay windows 7, but seriously, that processor? It gets overwhelmed by everything, not a multi tasker. Struggles with Netflix and I wouldn't dare try photoshop. Aesthetically, it's a nice computer, light and convenient. Decent battery life, not great. Definitely a bargain computer for a reason."
3.0,"Expected from the description that the device would both charge as well as act as a hub at the same time. This is not the case. This makes using the OTG features less than perfect. Still solid for being able to use as HUB, but not 100% what I bout it for."
3.0,The touchscreen works well and the image it came with booted with no issues but this is NOT a capacitive touchscreen as stated in the description. It is resistive. Had i known it was resistive i would have purchased another product that was capacitive.
3.0,"Case works fine, just too large for my purposes, won't fit in my regular bag for travel.  The strips used for the stand do leave an imprint on the screen of my tablet.  It's not much but I didn't care for that and returned it."
3.0,"Feels thinner, cheaper, shorter than I expected."
3.0,Not very impressed with this Kindle..can't tell the picture is any clearer than my older model Kindle..cuts off and reverts to home screen often..have had to restart it completely once or twice a day..Would have done as good with a more inexpensive model I think.
3.0,This didn't provide me with the distance I needed. My neighbor and I share our internet (there is a bout a 15 ft distance between our houses) and the router was positioned next to the window. I can pick up the internet just fine with my laptop and download 1-2mb's easy. My PS4 would keep disconnecting and it would go in and out even when hardwired in the Nighthawk. Just can't justify spending this about of money in when it's not giving the boost it describes.
3.0,Worked as expected
3.0,good choice
3.0,The case fits the 2nd Gen Nexus 7 perfectly.  I have own a Aegis Kraken Case for my Samsung case as well so I am comparing the two.  The Trident is an okay case and will protect the device but not as well as it's cousin the Kraken.  This has a soft cover with a somewhat hard plastic case for enclosure ... The Kraken on the other hand has a better plastic case and also comes with a very strudy and responsive BUILT-IN screen protector.  Honest opinion ... buy the Kraken and spend the extra bucks for it ... it is a much better case than the Trident.
3.0,After a few months of use the plastic broke. A little super glue fixed it but how long will it last.
3.0,Expensive... but it does the job.  Only complain is that it doesnt lock.  Could be easy to loose.
3.0,"I have the folio style Fintie cover for this model but would like to respond to comments here about having to turn off tablet. I usually keep several windows open like Chrome with a few tabs, Evernote to capture and edit shared content, Pixlr to edit screenshots, Email and Facebook. This arrangement works well for me because Android 4 handles multitasking and multiple windows very well - much better than Windows on my desktop computer.  To have to turn off the tablet to keep the Home button from activating the screen whenever the cover is closed would definitely slow down things for me.  BTW the Fintie folio style cover has the same problem, too, but to a lesser extent. In any case this discussion has inspired me to modify my current case by adding small dabs of something like silicone to keep the cover from activating the Home button as much.  EDIT (08/31/2015): For my Fintie folio style case I added two small  pieces of 5/16&#34; thick self-stick closed cell foam to either side of the raised Home button which has kept it from being activated inadvertently. Perhaps that would also work with the &#34;smart&#34; style case. IMO the best solution would be a case that had a flat one-piece cover rather than the ones that are so common these days with 3 sections that fold to create a make-shift stand which does not work that well. If I want to use a stand I use a stand- I prefer a cover that is just a cover."
3.0,It don't work right
3.0,stopped working properly after a year. Until then it was great.
3.0,"The color is true to the color shown on the product. The bottom cover fits, well, but the top cover and the keyboard cover does not fit as well as I would like them too. The keyboard cover can make typing awkward and is hard to push some of the buttons and feels as if the buttons &#34;stick&#34; because of it. The top cover fits a little awkwardly, but is not bad."
3.0,"Buy the one with &#34;two&#34; brightness levels instead of this one,"
3.0,Unfortunately i ordered a case that was bigge than my tablet but otherwise it was good buy
3.0,none
3.0,Works OK.
3.0,The range it's too short.
3.0,The case is well made and arrived in two days. The only reason I'm not giving this a higher rating is because there is no mechanism to hold the flap open such as an elastic strap. It's impossible to hold onto the handle and keep the flap open at the same time.
3.0,Runs hot.
3.0,Good quality
3.0,"The picture and the description do not accurately match the product. The picture shows a male 7-pin and a male 15-pin SATA connector, but the shipped item has a male 15-pin and  female 7-pin connector. Even the invoice shows the right description, but the shipped item is incorrect. The manufacturer probably knows the difference, but the vendor may seems to have gotten confused. As far as value goes, however, for such a very low price, it is a surprisingly sturdy product. Both cables are actually 12&#34;, not 10&#34; and 12&#34;, so you also get those two extra inches over the product description."
3.0,"Worked, but was not impressive."
3.0,"I've used this on two week-long vacations, carrying it every day. For the price, it's probably a good bag, though if you load it up, the thin leather doesn't inspire trust that it will last. I've noticed one thing about this that has greatly frustrated me more than anything else. There are just TOO many similar pockets that have you zipping and unzipping over and over to find what you're looking for. Along with that, it's awkward to access compartments, depending on which one of the many, while wearing it over one shoulder. You have to take it off. Some compartments have two zippers, some one. and the criss-crossing of straps on the side make it difficult to maneuver some zippers. It's just a frustrating bag for me."
3.0,Worked good when it worked. Went out after about 2 months.
3.0,"When I bought this I did not know just how small it would be, which is my own fault. It works fine, but is incredibly awkward because its smaller than an outstretched hand. Hard to tell if you hit a button or not or if you hit multiple buttons because there is no feedback."
3.0,"Check your lengths. 18&#34; sounded fine for replacement cables in my desktop, but truth is, they're all too short. Need 24-36&#34; to go from most of my SATA ports to other devices. My own mistake, just a precautionary tale from someone who ordered these and can't use them. Drive has to be really close to port to connect comfortably."
3.0,"I bought these around 7 months ago and so far I have already sent them in for not working. and a couple weeks after I sent them in they started having more problems like sound cutting out and just sound quality lowering. The headset is some what comfortable and the mic is ok, there is a good amount of bass but the sound isnt that good. The build quality is durable but when I move the headset even slightly it makes loud creaking sounds. I would not reccomend, maybe if the headset was 40 dollars it would be considerable."
3.0,Con:  At first I could not get the Mini USB connector into the hole because the leather is too close on one side.  I had to stretch the leather a bit and now it's still a little tricky but it works.  Pros:  Looks sharp and well made.
3.0,"For anyone looking for seven USB ports to charge you phones, tablets etc. when plugged into a wall (A/C), this isn't it.  When plugged into a wall only the TWO USB ports work, the other five do not.  The other five only work when you also plug in the included power/USB plug to your computer.  So to have all seven working, you need to be plugged into a wall AND plugged into a USB on your computer.  I made the mistake ordering this for my vacation so I could charge all my phones and families devised with JUST the A/C power chord."
3.0,"Purchased this bag for my son as he left for college and wanted a bag that he could transport his laptop in.  The bag came fast and appears to be very durable and roomy.  Unfortunately the laptop did not fit.  He can zip up the bag most of the way but the corner of the laptop is exposed.  At the laptop gets closer to the top of the bag, the bag gets narrow where it rounds over at the top.  I have returned the bag for something larger.<br />My son has a ASUS republic of gamers 17&#34; laptop."
3.0,good
3.0,Ok I have had this maybe a month or two it worked fine for awhile however  it has  slowed dramatically I give it  maybe a week before it  stops running completely  ..I far from happy with this product .I have had  my past graphics card run  at  the same  rate  for a year now i thought i was upgrading when I purchased this  but  I  seemed to have downgraded instead
3.0,The tab on the front leaves a sticky residue. Why not have only the tab on the pull-off sheet.
3.0,"Seemed promising at first, as the hardware specs are quite impressive for the size and price, but I later paid for it 10x with the countless hours I wasted trying to load my own OS/kernel. The software support is nearly non-existent, and eventually had to refer to external sources for information, but still failed to get this paperweight to work as anything more. I am really tempted to give it a good review as to not screw myself out of selling it online.<br /><br />The only reason I give this 3 stars, is because I believe a lot of this _had_ to be due to my insufficient experience, or the fact that I even attempted to go outside of the box and try to load custom software on it.<br /><br />I ended up just using a raspberry pi, which was a walk–in–the–park by comparison.<br /><br />I still believe this device could be great for small projects like a router or IDS, but I didn't have enough time to hack it.<br />NO WAY would I trust this device for industrial/commercial use as other users have reported; I too had a problem with heat, and the hdmi interfaces were flaky to say the least."
3.0,"It is functional but I won't be putting my phone in it. If I put my phone in it, the button will not stay clasped. If I fill it with more than a few things it won't stay clasp in general. Not what I expected for what I paid."
3.0,"Its a nice pair of headphones. Suits all of my needs. But the main problem you should be aware of is strain on the 3.5mm jack. its made of a soft material and will wear out easily depending on how much you use the headphones without the usb. It does work on phones and retains all its functionality(that doesn't require the special software) but the cord is really long and a bit annoying when walking around. These are a nice pair of headphones that will wear out really easily, you will at some point make use of that warranty."
3.0,"Working as expected, no issues so far.."
3.0,It did not fit my keyboard :(
3.0,"Not being able to scroll with the trackball is very disappointing. OK for other mouse functions, but I scroll a lot, and not being able to do that is a huge drawback. I have Windows Vista operating system."
3.0,"Firstly, I want to say I like the unit but it does not have the best quality control. The first unit I bought had an issue with the HDMI port... it was to recessed and the plug did not make a good connection. Returned it and the second one was OK. The real issue I have with Nextbook is there tech support, if you can call it that. Call support and expect to wait at least 10 minutes holding on the phone for a person. Then what you get is a rep that is more customer service then tech. They are not trained techs. Ask them more than how to turn on the tablet and you will get a song and a dance but the bottom line is they don't know. I asked a rep about using  WIFI Direct and he didn't know what WIFI Direct was.<br />If your going to use the unit for light duty application it's good but for something more complicated there will be issues."
3.0,Was good headphones while they lasted.. I got about 6 months of use out of them before the mic shorted out and one speaker started to sound like crap.
3.0,"I ordered this item in particular because it has a suction cup underneath the tray. It works alright in terms of keeping the soap dry in between uses, but the dish was wobbly on the counter. air doesn't come off, but it doesn't sit on the counter tight. I ordered two trays and bother are the same way.<br /><br />One of the dishes did not come with the suction cup originally, but was replaced right away!"
3.0,"No complaints on the hardware side. Use and installation with the cd is quick and easy. Tablet and pen are solid and I don't see any problems in the future. I purchased the Intuos Manga and it didn't come with any of the advertised manga studio programs. Basically I just purchased the small with a fancier box.<br />The company however is lacking. Customer service, website and call line are all severely lacking and moderately frustrating to access and use. I'll take my chances with Huion or someone else next time."
3.0,"It works, sort of. Doesn't keep a charge long."
3.0,"Some cables are too short to do cable management espically with video card installed. I have problem rerouting the cable across the mother board. So its hard to make the cables clean but I do understand for that because of the price. Afterall, it does the job for the price."
3.0,"It's a keyboard... It works, it's fine.  However, it's really bulky.  Takes up a lot of space on my desk.  I mean it looks like a typewriter on my desk, it's huge."
3.0,Slow CPU therefore overall performance is hindered.  Neat and clean look.  Seems well made.  Keys are a bit &#34;mushy&#34; but tolerable.  You get want you pay for and at this price point this laptop is no surprise.
3.0,"A little expensive for what you get,  what I really didn't like, is you can't use it as a tablet, or if you do, there's no protection from the front, so not very practical, I returned it."
3.0,Much smaller than it looked like in the photos. They were very deceiving!  Only reason I didn't send it back was that the posted dimensions were correct.
3.0,Light & durable... But stay up too great. It's constantly falling while my son is trying to watch a movie.
3.0,Resolution and clarity not as good as advertised.
3.0,Not as fast as I had hoped.  Freezes up on occasion.
3.0,Mine fits perfectly. But it came in with a big scratch in the front
3.0,"It works. I didn't expect to be gaming or watching videos on this, so a little bit of lag didn't bother me, but the lag that it does have is completely off putting. Perhaps it's because I have a triple monitor setup running off a 13&#34; rMBP, but the third monitor is only used for documents and coding. You sort of get used to predicting where the mouse would be, but I would have expected performance like this from USB 2, not 3.0 as it claims. It works. But that's about it. I'm happy, but a bit disappointed."
3.0,i rated it 3 stars probably its not fair for the manufacturer but i am really having trouble to use it. but my friends say its the windows 8 sucks. i wish it has windows 7 in the laptop.<br />the touch screen is too sensitive it keeps switching the screen whenever i touch it.<br />anyways maybe i m not computer expert so maybe i should use something less advanced....<br />and its a little too heavy for me....
3.0,"only one standing position, wish it had more"
3.0,It's pretty cheaply made
3.0,WIsh they had more volume but the sound quality is excellent.
3.0,"This is not like the incase iPad mini case which I LOVE!!<br />This one is way thicker and bulky, not what I was expecting. It was returned!"
3.0,"It served the purpose I was looking for - more protection for my ipad mini for when my 20 month old decides to walk around with it, but it does not stand up tall like the picture makes you think it does. It is like a foam rubber material, so when I try to use the handle like a stand it just keeps falling over. Luckily we have an ipad stand already, so I can just put the ipad, case and all on it to stand it up, but if you are looking to use this not just as protection, but also as a stand, look at some other options."
3.0,Should have looked into a cover with a strap to keep the cover for the kindle closed.
3.0,I was a little disappointed in this product.  I had this same kind of product by a different manufacturer that I think worked much better (I left it out in the rain and ruined it).  I just got it yesterday and tried it on two separate radios.  The one I had before would sometimes make dramatic differences in reception where this one doesn't.  I will update this later after more use.  I think the time of year and atmospheric conditions can affect reception so I'll see how it does over the next few months.
3.0,It came quickly even though there was a delayed. ..I purchased this used but very good....Unfortunately it looked VERY....used and dirty...but seems to work so far.
3.0,Doesn't charge very well. Takes hours to charge my Ipad mini and my iphone 5.
3.0,Bought for my original Xbox and after being on for about 30 min. It gets substantially hot.
3.0,It's advertised as having a 6 hour battery.  It actually is only 3 hours or so.  That's disappointing.  Other than that it's great.
3.0,"The device itself is good, but it suffers tremendously by the lack of a proper strap to attach it to keys, etc."
3.0,Excellent fit.  However the edges exposed when installed are razor sharp and dig in when typing.  There's also a mounting ridge located exactly where your wrist rests while using the trackpad.  I'm going to see it a couple passes with fine grained sandpaper will fix the edge.  Other than that the case adds a nice tactile feel to my Air while carrying it around.
3.0,"This was my 2nd replacement batter for Samsung R480...it was just an okay battery. I would have given it 4 starts but it died suddenly after 14 months. It had been working fine up until then with no noticeable drop in charge.  Batter life was about average and would usually last somewhere between 90-120 minutes.  There seem to be other cheaper options out there now, so I will probably try a different one this time around since I have no battery now and need the Prime one-day shipping"
3.0,Good for the money I paid.
3.0,"I've been using 6 of their KF-1000-BK model in 3 rigs for over 10 years without a problem. Bought the 1003 model because the local shop was out of the other ones. It works fine though the door is not as rigid as the 1000, you'll feel it flex/bend as the door is closed. The release/open latch is flimsy on this model. The lock is not as positive and a few times the door has opened slightly. The drive didn't loose connection but still a mild concern. The latch lock is a triangular plastic key. It works but has that cheapened feel. No worries if you lose the key, insert a small flat head screwdriver in and you'll be able to open the door. Losing the key on the KF-1000 means you'll have to remove the bay to finesse the door open.<br /><br />The tension spring will leave scratches on the top of the drive. Why they included it on this model IDK. I removed later and the drive insertion-removal is smoother without that dragging tension.<br /><br />This hot swap bay covers the basics though I would suggest the KF-1000 model for the more robust door and locking. It feels more rigid when opening closing and the door has a positive secure closure.  [[ASIN:B00126U0VA KingWin Single Bay 3.5-Inch Internal SATA Trayless Hot Swap Rack with Key Lock (KF-1000-BK)]]"
3.0,"Works as advertised, but it frequently becomes disconnected from its bluetooth paired computer.  Can require many tens of seconds to reconnect.  Very annoying.  Like the ability to switch among the machines I have."
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,Nice marterial and product however it was much smaller than expected. Even the water bottle and phone slot is smaller than standard. There are a lot of pockets so there is room to put things else.  It'll still be useful. Just not for what was originally intended.
3.0,The cover looks nice. However if you have kids it's not durable enough. I bought the case and put it on 2 days later my son dropped it and the entire screen shattered.
3.0,Is it cool? Yes. Does it worth the money? Nope. I may say though that I'm an apple fan so I may be a little bias.<br /><br />The product is great and I wish it was at a lower price where it'll crush the competition. It's versatility is a great advantage over others but the price man....the price...
3.0,Don't add too much of the spray to your shield and it should be fine. Just follow the instructions and it should be pretty easy to install. It's a good buy.
3.0,"Bought two as exit fans on a custom case. Can see the blue through the case. One works perfect and I'm not worried about a slightly louder fan (price = noise, in this case).<br />On one of the fans though two of the LEDs are in and out. requires some tweaking on the support and board arms to get them to turn on then they go out again after about 5-10 minutes. I have lots of other lights in the case so I am not worried if two don't work, just be aware that price generally equals quality."
3.0,"After using this product for about 3 times, it seems to already be shorting out. Works otherwise."
3.0,"Problems with DVD, needs up grade did not expect. Sound  issues. Need more time with the lap top hopefully no more issues than already stated."
3.0,"Ok, first thing first.<br /><br />This DOESN'T WORK on Mac. Do you want to know why? Look at the pics below. Looks like it was only suppose to work on PCs that run XP (in 2015?) and below all the way to Win 98.<br /><br />Does not come with batteries. I don't really care about it. I want my money back for the mouse that doesn't work on current Macs.<br /><br />Other than that, item is as described. Mouse felt very in sync with my hand curves, but sadly I cannot use it due to complete incompatibility with Macs."
3.0,bay for standred cd/dvd burner is too shallow  burner sticks out from the tower about 2 inches
3.0,After about a year the outer rubber cover became soft and began tearing. Also the stand is flimsy. It broke easily. However it's hard to find a reasonably priced better case.
3.0,Took longer then i thought.
3.0,"I got these headphones because I was sick of blowing through other pairs thanks to cable crimping and losing sound in one or both ears.  Having Bluetooth headphones is definitely a luxury worth every cent.  This set is surprisingly nice for the price and seeing how it's a rather off-brand company.  Pros - Controls were simple enough to set up to my android phone without a hitch. - The ear pads are very soft and comfortable.  They might make your ears a bit sore if you don't have them adjusted just right.  I prefer to have them set right around the bottom of my ears instead of completely overlapping them in middle. - Battery life is pretty good.  I can go several work days listening to music the whole time without worrying about the battery dying on me - The rubber/plastic headband is also very comfortable  Cons - Sound is decent, but not that great either, but that's typical for this price - The materials aren't that durable - No push-to-talk feature for the mic in case you were planning to use for gaming  Even though I tried my best to take care of them, I too am suffering the problem where the plastic in the headband around the fold joints is starting to break away which will ruin the whole thing.  I've barely had the set for a little more than a month, so this is quite a bummer seeing how much I initially liked them.  Best thing you can really do if you have a big head is to reinforce the plastic at the joint just a little using whatever you got.  Hopefully you can catch it early like I did so you can fix it.  If you can do that then you'll more than likely be satisfied with them for quite some time.  EDIT:: Removing another star.  After having them for about 6 months the band on the head split in half due to how it was stretching over my head to cover my ears.  I had to wrap it up with duct tape and now it doesn't look as nice.  Thankfully none of the wiring got damaged so it still plays audio just fine, but the band is a bit uncomfortable now.  If I had noticedsooner I probably could have reinforced it before it cracked, but if I'm gonna have to be taping up the entire headset just so it doesn't break, I should just get a different headset."
3.0,"The board is a cute idea. However the magnet is totally useless.<br />At first I thought the whole board itself is a magnet on the back so it could stick on the fridge. But it actually is for little magnet stick on the four corners of the board and after only one day, the board came off on the floor. They are not sticky enough to hold the weight of the board."
3.0,I love this mouse but the usb adapter is bigger than it should be and got bent in my backpack (i connect it to my work laptop). Now my keyboard and mouse don't work!
3.0,"I had to send this one back. It looked great in the add but when I got it, my son added maybe 7 games and was told he was out of memory. The android 5.0 just takes up too much space. This needs at least 16gb or a smaller operating system."
3.0,"Pretty, but does not feel like genuine leather."
3.0,"It's a bit tricky to set up and get running smoothly, at least on my Windows 8. Once it is working, the connection is strong but the quality is disappointing. The speakers I use are great with any bluetooth that I try, but this one. I'm only keeping it because I thankfully don't need it that often."
3.0,"Great range -- but couldn't get any of my devices to be able to connect to the internet through it, even though I had it connected per the instructions.  I am a fairly tech savvy person, and I still had trouble with this despite all the troubleshooting.  The same thing happened when my friend who is very tech savvy had the same problems.<br /><br />Maybe it was just my router?  I don't know -- but for some reason there was the issue of not being able to connect to the internet through the extender.  Totally bummed this didn't work out the way I thought it would.<br /><br />If it did work, I'd obviously rate this a 5-star."
3.0,I replaced a link system E4200 with this high $$ one. Wireless reception outside isn't as good in my garage as the 4200 which is less expensive.  Was disappointed. This 9200 even has antennas and the 4200 doesnt.
3.0,Unfortunately the power plug ripped out during the installation proccess.  It looks like it's not glued down so you have to take apart the unit to plug it back it.  Outside of that it works.
3.0,"THE GOOD / EXPERIENCE: I had this for about 6 months. It fits the 1st Gen perfectly fine and even resembles the finish and makes for a nice aesthetic case. Makes it look and feel like something that came with the Nexus instead of a 3rd party add on. Which is nice and clean. I really like that a lot about it. It also has a nearly full functioned keyboard and that expands the use and potential of your tablet nicely. You'll learn about some functionalities that you probably didn't know existed in an android with the extra buttons and options on this keyboard. It has arrow keys, alt keys, even a home key, and everything else which make your tablet a much more utilitarian fully functioning productivity device.  But...<br /><br />THE BAD/ CONS: The keyboard is very small b/c it's matched perfectly to the size of the Nexus 7 and includes nearly all the keys of a full size keyboard ... and that means typing is not easy for a person with average or large adult sized hands.  It feels like you're typing on a  keyboard for a baby doll or something... with fingers all close together it definitely takes some getting used to.<br /><br />EXPERIENCE CONTINUED: I had it inside a nice vinyl zip up carrying case, which originally came with a phone purchase from Costco, but it's size fits the Nexus 7 so I dusted it off and started using it to carry the Nexus and this as a shell. Inside there the keyboard worked well and it's also a good way to stand up the tablet for viewing movies, landscape as pictured. It even will hold it up for portrait orientation but not quite as solidly... and it is good at protecting the screen when it was not in use.  And the battery on this thing lasts a VERY long time. Once you charge it.... it just goes and goes for weeks.<br /><br />THE UGLY: It all fit in perfectly until......  it slipped out of the case  and hit  the ground. Good news. It protected the tablet and there was minimal damage to the Nexus. I had even dropped a different Nexus 7 before (without this case) and that screen cracked completely rendering it useless. I could replace the screen and touch sensors for that and it would work again. That has yet to happen.<br /><br />THE REDEMPTION: But this really kept it safe, although I think my foot caught some of the fall before it hit the sidewalk. After inspection I found this keyboard had sort of come apart while breaking the fall. So I put the on / off switch back in place, which was much harder than it should have been. I realized how delicately the thing was made but eventually I got it in place and snapped the unit back together.<br /><br />It didn't look like it was beat up too much but it the keyboard was completely inactive.  It wouldn't turn on or off, charge or anything. So it did a good job protecting the tablet (thankfully) but didn't protect itself. I supposed that's the lesser of 2 evils.<br /><br />RATING and COMPARISON: SO because of that I give it 3 stars. If the keyboard was larger it would be really great. However, I tried to step up my game and replace it with a moko keyboard [[ASIN:B00E4OL66A MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case - Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Cover Case for Google Nexus 2 7.0 Inch 2013 Generation Android 4.3 Tablet, YELLOW]], because it was in a leather/style case and the keyboard was more of an adult size. So I figured it would be easier to type on and protect the tablet even more.  But half of that keyboard didn't type when I got it. So Now I still use THIS as a case and just go without a functioning keyboard.  At least it did work properly out of the box which is more than we can say for the MOKO units.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you want something that is not the best for extended typing, but looks good, clean and has some decent protective qualities for your 1st Gen Nexus 7 then this is a great product for the price.  If you have small hands or want to buy for a teenager, then it's really perfect!  But don't expect it to make the tablet bulletproof. I may have just gotten a little lucky. If 100% protective qualities means you can drop it off a table onto a hardwood floor when this is snapped onto the front of it... and nothing would happen to the tablet or this... then I'd say you'll get about 40-60%  tablet protection. and 20-25% keyboard protection. If it's just sitting in the slot while you type, then all bets are off.<br /><br />If you plan to do a lot of typing and you want something robust then spend more and get a more durable and full sized one.  In that case this isn't the one for you. But for casual use and some basic protection in a clean quality design then this is perfect!  Buy accordingly."
3.0,"Drive is fine, not fast, but ok for the price."
3.0,"The case is fine for the price.  However, the sleep/wake magnet feature doesn't work.  Screen stays lit when cover is closed.  It works occasionally, but not often enough to count on.  That's a very important feature for me which is why I gave it 3 stars.  Time will tell whether or not the quality is there however it appears to protect my iPad air.  The rotating feature is extremely stiff, which is probably a good thing, but it makes positioning a bit difficult.  I will be ordering a different case and use this one as a back-up."
3.0,"It's nice, and the case is durable, and my 4 year old absolutely loves it.  It's really all fun and games, until the storage is full... Constantly!  And a pain to delete pictures. My 4 year old has tons of apps that he can screen shot and fill up allllll of the memory in no time. Deleting them takes forever. We have had this for 8 months. For the first time last week I had to restore it to factory settings, which was a huge pain.  I had to do this because you need wifi to delete things out of storage apparently, and the when I tried to hook to wifi it said I did not have enough storage to connect... ????  Still a great value for the price and he loves the free play, but not very parent friendly."
3.0,"I like everything about this tablet but the reliability.  bad usb and charging ports within 9 months of purchase on one of the three tablets we bought for the kids.  the AC port is just ridiculously flimsy and we've gone through all three chargers in less than 6 months...  Outside of that, functionality has been remarkably good, with little to no slowdown on speed or multitasking..."
3.0,I had bubbles on mine after I applied it. I tried the rubber bands and it helped!
3.0,Low performance wifi
3.0,Too much of a christmas light feel tbh
3.0,I was in need of additional USB ports and now have them.
3.0,"headset is a little fritzy sometimes and constantly has updates, and earpads need to be broken in before they feel comfortable"
3.0,"The only thing that I don't like about this case is, I don't think it's for an iPad Air 2. In order for me to get my volume to work I had break off a part of the case ."
3.0,Exactly what I was looking for. The screen protector was missing when I opened the box.
3.0,"Does the job, although the antennas are extremely extremely weak!"
3.0,I had some trouble at first since file would become &#34;corrupt&#34;. So i just formated the hard drive and PRESTO! it worked like a charm.<br /><br />Ps. Usable Capacity is 229 GB
3.0,These work great but they are a bit over priced in my opinion. The antenna bend points are also a bit easy to break. I have warned our users about being gentle to avoid breaking off the antenna at the bend points.
3.0,1 out 10 times ill do a transfer ill get an error.
3.0,Bought this for the New 2015 Surface 3. While it fits the surface 3 it is maybe 1/2&#34; wider than the tablet as it was originally made for the surface pro. This didn't work for me so I returned it. Other than that the day I tried it seemed like it worked and I liked the idea. It did weigh substantially more than the standard keyboard due to extra battery weight.
3.0,"I bought these so I could plug my earbuds into the female, and plug one male into my phone (for music) and the other male into a desktop at college (for videos). When I have music and a video playing at the same time, the quality of both just turned to crap. I bought three of these, and it's the same for all. I might be able to find another use for them, but they don't work for what I intended them for."
3.0,Very slow processor.
3.0,This device is too wide to allow another USB device of any kind to plug in to the adjcent USB port.  I have also experienced occasional connection interruptions.
3.0,"I got this as a spare. The keys stick sometimes esp. the space bar and they have a softer rubber feel vs hard plastic. The action is not light so if you want a low profile key with swift action I would not recommend. Overall it does what a keyboard should, again this is just a spare bastard child to me so it's fine, but I would not use for my daily gaming or work."
3.0,This  product is advertised as a 12.5 ~13.3 inch laptop and it is a tight squeeze for my 11.6 inch laptop???  A bit disappointed
3.0,"Great price and good resolution for what I use the monitor for.  Cons:  the base/stand is cheap and weak.  There is a lot of play/movement.  Monitor did not come with instructions, although you don't really need them for assembly.  However, the controls are non-intuitive.  The symbols and indicator lights are on the lower right hand front of the frame, but no buttons or other indication of how to manipulate them.  I thought maybe it could only be controlled with a remote, but there wasn't one.  Found out by accident that you simply touch the frame underneath each function to use them.  There are no indentations or other indication of this part of the design, but once you figure it out, it works fine."
3.0,"Audio cuts out on occasion, seems like a connectivity problem with the bluetooth possibly. Other than that its just an ok headset, decent audio, comfortable for up to a few hours."
3.0,not what i expected in sound quality
3.0,"I use the mouse on Windows 7.  The mouse is very light and tracks very well. The touch scrolling works, but not very well.  The actual area dedicated to scrolling is small (it is not the entire top) and can be missed with your finger.  The buttons are very stiff."
3.0,"I'd say this is a great modem when it works. Having worked in IT for over a decade, I'm pretty good at install and config, but the first one was a dud and neither the tech nor I could get it to play nice with Comcast. Popped a temporary modem on for about 12 hours until I could get to a local brick-and-mortar to pick up another of this exact modem, and lo and behold I got a working one. Reconfigured the connection, and it's been stable for a couple months (minus maybe five manual reboots, of which I don't know the exact cause as the levels are proper). Searching around, this is a relatively common issue, so if you get a dud just swap it out and hopefully you'll be back up and running.<br /><br />I made my pick off Wirecutter's suggestions and the potential for upgrades in my area. We just got bumped up to 75Mbps down, and I'd say speed tests average around 78Mbps throughout the day and night. This certainly has enough capacity to go above this as well, so maybe once the entrenched ISPs get enough competition we'll see how high it can go. *crosses fingers*<br /><br />Taking off two starts because while it works, it certainly isn't 100% stable and there seems to be a wider issue with quality control for this model. But if you get a good one, it should max out most connections."
3.0,Still thankful for  the small speed improvement.
3.0,"Good product, and it works well for both of the Lightning-charger devices I own, including my phone when I take it out of the case. Downside is, it doesn't work with either of the cases I've tried for the iPhone 6 Plus (both the Catalyst and Lifeproof Nüüd) so I've had to go back to the shorter-length factory cord. My wife uses it with her iPhone 5S (Lifeproof Frē case) with no problems, however."
3.0,"The plug you sent was great. But I did ask if it would fit nz standards and you said yes,but it didn't so I had to go and buy an adaptor to be able to use it."
3.0,Hace el trabajo
3.0,decent but the company will spam you to death begging for a review.
3.0,Recommended Installation-Tool price unbelievable
3.0,Works ok.
3.0,"This product is an okay product, but don't expect to use it for school and work just for videos and play, or for little kids the screen is way to small, not fast enough the tools are outdated."
3.0,did not hold the ipad on as securely as I hoped.  had to readjust a few times.  worked fine after we rigged it
3.0,"I travel quite often for work and was looking for a portable 10-key that I could take along with me. This product works as described and responds nicely to touch, and is a must-have when you work all day in a numeric-based system. HOWEVER... I am quite spoiled on the USB-receiver-storage feature that is seen with many peripheral devices today, like Logitech mice/keyboards (where the USB has a little handy-dandy storage spot in the battery compartment.) This 10-key is already driving me crazy because it does not have one, so I will always have to carry it around it its box now and can't just toss it in my bag in fear of losing the USB receiver. I know that the standard response is &#34;why don't you just leave the receiver in the USB slot of the computer,&#34; but I switch between 2 laptops and have to pop it out depending on what type of system I am in.<br /><br />Bottom line: the product arrived as it looks in the picture and feels fine, like it is decent quality - it is thick (definitely not flimsy) and lays flat (aka not propped up.) However, the lasck of a storage compartment for the USB receiver is something I overlooked before purchasing this and 2 days in, it already drives me nuts. If you are going to leave this plugged in to a computer at all times and will NOT be taking the USB receiver in and out of the computer, this will be a great peripheral device for you."
3.0,good buy
3.0,Too sensitive for me...
3.0,Great product. I love the color and fit. However I did not like how the case has an iBenzer logo in the bottom right corner where everyone can see it. It is a bit of an eye sore and very obvious. The product pictures do not have the logo on them and if I had known this I would not have purchased the case.
3.0,"Excellent cable and well made, except that the area where you hold with your fingers to insert the mini-USB is a little too big and heavy, in comparison to the metal pins area. You can see this from the image. This sometimes causes the inserted mini-USB to fall out of the device unit."
3.0,Kindle fires are great. However they never last for long. Been thru 2 so far. But ill be buying a new one again.  At least it seems they fixed the charging problem.
3.0,"No works with toshiba satellite s55t-b model. Not covers the entire screen size, only covers the viewable area."
3.0,Changes pages when I am not ready for it. much prefer the Kindle that you pushed a button to change page.
3.0,Good price. Works as described. Wish the cord was a little longer. The unit does get very hot with use so need to be careful where it is located so you don't have a problem.
3.0,Its nice but the standing is no to scure.
3.0,But you have to be vary careful with the connections.  They can be temperamental.
3.0,It is too small and does not response well to the swipe..
3.0,"It charges pretty well. The cord is really long which is nice but often says &#34;accessory not supported&#34; and has to be unplugged and plugged back in. They easily break, poor construction."
3.0,Got this and it broke after a week
3.0,"It's ok, range is pretty short, keys are super small, unit is hard to hold and using the edge keys makes it flip up when on a hard surface.  Good for quick use if needed.  Better to get a larger wireless keyboard."
3.0,Jury is still out.........will revisit in 2months after performance assessment.
3.0,"the advertisements keeps making the shopping icon show up on my carousel very annoying.<br />cant seem to turn off the locator that tracks you everywhere, an app turned it on and not i cant turn it off.<br /><br />Video quality is good"
3.0,great buy
3.0,"Purchased for our 2 year old after our Nabi broke. This tablet is very hard to navigate around, it freezes and stalls a lot, cannot use apps that you've already purchased except when logged out of Freetime. Our 2 year old had no trouble navigating her Nabi but needs helps accessing most things on this tablet."
3.0,so the fan works fine it does what its supposed to do but let me say that the red led is not good at all . imusing a corsair spec 01 red case so i got the 1 fan that was included with the case and its way better than this fan. the fan also gives off a very weird buzzing noise that gets slightly louder when the case cover gets put back on because the sound doesnt have much room to escape. so if u wear a headset you should be fine but i dont like wearing one and unfortunately corsair doesnt sell the same fans that came with the case.
3.0,"I use my laptop to surf the web, download music, watch youtube and less usually for the microsft suite of apps - word & excel. The limited storage capacity is the main detraction but I get they are trying to move you to cloud atorage.  I don't care for the having to sign into microsoft to access the apps.  It crashes alot but that is probably because I've maxed out the memory.  Either I have to change my thining towards storage or I'm goimg to have to get another laptop."
3.0,"Windows only, will not work with Mac unless Boot Camped. Works with most games but not all features work."
3.0,My granddaughter loves it but we bought it because we thought it would be on wheels and we would like to have a handle I can run the picture
3.0,"Not a bad numpad.  The Cherry MX Brown keys are certainly nice, but it has a few quirks.  They make Mac and PC specific versions, and if you mix, you'll get odd behavior (particularly if you hit the keys with any speed.)  Also, tapping the 00 key seems to lock out the 0 key for half a second, which can frustrate data entry if you're not aware of it.  EDIT: After posting this review, I started noticing other issues with the 00 key.  I have two of these keypads.  On one, the 0 key locks out the 00 key for a half a second or so (I might have had this backwards in the original review.)  On the other, pressing 00 followed by any other key causes four 0s to be entered!  It seems that there's an issue with the older firmwares on windows 7 and up.  The same one that likes to double-key itself also just started to require that I reconnect the USB cable after every boot, so it's getting ditched."
3.0,Works well enough so far but the slide just runs loose unless you snap it in place which is not as easy as it looks.  Could be a lot better designed
3.0,"Considering it is a very low cost tablet, it is adequate.  The battery life is horrible, or I would give it one additional star."
3.0,"Quite easy to install. Driver for windos 10 easily available. Sound is nediocre and controls to better &#34;mix or eq&#34; the sound are almost non existent. Maybe the digital out put will do netter, but I highly doubt it.  Would buy something better, maybe more money but better results.<br />BOTTOM LINE; I would not buy it again and probably would recomend looking at other sound cards."
3.0,"First, the tablet holding or mounting, works with a bare tablet only, no case or enclosure is allowed on the tablet. The over all quality, gives me the feeling of not providing long term or heavy use reliability. If you need a keyboard for your tablet to use from time to time, this should fill  the bill and is reasonable priced. I am comparing this to an outstanding bluetooth keyboard by Think Outside, no longer being made for some years, now. It has a pop up flat mounting plate, which you wouldn't consider being much, that holds my smart phone or my 7&#34; tablet, landscape wise, with enclosed case."
3.0,"good product, good price, does what it's supposed to.  packaging is in korean"
3.0,wasnt able to use as its possible having issue with the hard disk supply unit
3.0,It only last an hour. But it was not costly. I will get a better one.
3.0,"I've spent the previous few months using this keyboard.  Today I stopped - went back to the far less expensive and stylish K360.  Here's why:<br /><br />Actually typing on it sucks.<br /><br />I'd thought that maybe it was the size of my hands or something.  Turns out that -- after some measurement taking on my part -- I've found that the true source of the problem is that the keys are spaced and sized differently from most other full-sized keyboards.  The surface for each letter is larger, and the keys are about 50% closer together.<br /><br />Additionally, though the keypress distance is short, the springs are stiffer than I'm used to, and seem to provide more resistance the further down they're pressed.<br /><br />The difference in size, spacing, and key tension were, for me, a perfect storm of problems.  I noticed many of my keystrokes not registering because I hadn't pressed they key hard enough.  And the amount of typos I've had on that keyboard were just insane.  It wasn't my usual typo, where my brain picked the wrong key -- no, these were typos because I was actually pushing two, sometimes even three keys simultaneously due to the spacing being *just* that different from other keyboards I use during my day.<br /><br />Got to a point where despite it's primo design, build quality, ability to be recharged, and ability to be both a keyboard and mouse across the room on a lap -- all things that can't be understated (seriously, best backlighting I think I've ever seen)... I just hated actually *typing* on it.<br /><br />It now lives in the living room, on the Media PC.  Mostly I control that one with my phone, but it's nice to know that a keyboard and mouse are right there should I ever need those.<br /><br />I can't give it a 1 because it is far from a terrible product.  I can't give it a 2 because frankly it's just worth more than that, by a lot.  I still have it in use, even, if very infrequently.<br /><br />But I also can't give it a four or five because ofhow much I hope I don't have to use it during my day."
3.0,I like it but it was delivered dirty as if it was used
3.0,This battery doesn't hold as well as the original equipment did when it was new.  It is much less expensive than a Toshiba replacement battery and  It replaced a dead battery so at least I have some power now when I am not plugged to AC.  Mail service was fast by Priority Mail.
3.0,"Plastic shines up really bad after minimal use, you have to wipe it down frequently.  My Deathadder never had that issue.  Mouse works great, CUE software leaves a lot to be desired, be sure to read the forums about lighting issues before you commit to this mouse if you are excited about the RGB features.  Also, if you don't need it right away... WAIT.  They are changing the logo back to the sailing ship and getting rid of this hideous tramp stamp.  Hold out until they release the new version with the old logo.  Once they do that, I will be buying another one of these."
3.0,"The lap top case was exactly like the photograph and fabric was strong and padding inside was sufficient.  However, it did not fit the laptop which was 17 inches.  While trying to close the zipper, it tore in the corner.  I returned it because it did not fit.  With a smaller laptop it would be idea."

3.0,"I ordered this a while back for my husband. He's a die-hard Fate Zero fan. He absolutely loved it. It's the perfect size for phones, which is where he put his. My only complaint about it is the adhesive wore off after a bit, and he kept slicing his fingers on the decal as it was peeling from his phone. Other than that, it was totally rad."
3.0,"Waterproof as advertised, but the metal ring rusted after 3 uses"
3.0,"Well all in all the word, well I think it's a word at least, Meh pretty much sums up how I feel about this product.  It has a light on it which was pretty much my only criteria for searching for a case.  If it weren't for the light I would just as soon have no case on it at all because the kindle feels much much better in my hands with no case.  But until such a time as I bite the bullet and upgrade to a paperwhite I need a reading light and a case with one built in is by far the most elegant solution.<br /><br />First of all it has a light.  The light functions as you would expect it to, the light is powered by your kindle, it only comes on when your kindle is powered on (as in not in sleep mode with the screen locked).  When you close the light the light goes off but the slightest jostle will unseat the light and cause it to come back on.  This isn't a huge issue it's not like having light is a bad thing even in sunlight it's just annoying.<br /><br />I honestly don't know about battery life as I didn't pay that much attention before.  Now it will last about a week when I am actively reading a book I am engaged in a few times a day.  I feel like this is certainly reduced from where it was without the light, I mean it has to effect battery life, but it's not like you will have to charge your kindle daily like you do your phone or anything.<br /><br />The design of the product is well a little feminine in my opinion.  The swirly pattern on this case is an absolute eyesore and I have no idea why they didn't just make it a plain flat front.  It would have looked so much better and classier.  Luckily for me I do all my reading on my kindle at home so this isn't much of an issue.  I don't feel like I could be a respectable man carrying this thing around however.<br /><br />The absolute worst part of this case is the felt material they use on the inside of the case.  This material just absolutely feels wrong on your hands and it makes it where I absolutely can not hold the case with the front flap folded all the way back where I have to hold the inside portion.  I have to hold it with the front flap dangling loosely and hold just the back portion of the case.  Whatever this is was just a horrible design choice as if I hold it too long it makes me feel like my hands are way too dry or something.<br /><br />All in all it performs the function I wanted it to perform but it is a horrible design at almost every turn from the way the light closes in the case, to the design in the pleather/vinyl type material, to the choice of material on the inside.  Maybe it will just push me into that paperwhite a bit sooner.he case with the front flap folded all the way back where I have to hold the inside portion.

3.0,"to be completely honest, it's pretty s***ty, but it gets the job done. For $10 I'm not complaining but it's only worth about that. It came a little bit broken - which doesn't really matter as it only makes it click a little bit when I type and I'm just using it until I find a better one I like, but I definitely wouldn't use this long-term. It's really cute though, and the color is exactly what it looked like in the picture."
3.0,cools you lap
3.0,"This case is really cute, but the snap closure broke after about 2 weeks of use."
3.0,Read speed are nice; write speeds are ridiculously slow.  Beware...
3.0,"I've only used the product for a short time, but noticed that my system has been locking up after I started using the card. This was on a new system with a fresh install of Linux Mint 17.2."
3.0,-Matte finish if you have decals on your laptop they wont show thru<br />-Color is very pretty and true to the picture they have<br />- Screen protector is the correct size to the screen (HAVE YET TO APPLY)<br />-Keyboard cover.. WHICH ONE? MY ORDER DIDN'T COME WITH ONE<br />-The dust cover is 2 shades lighter than case but its cute and will be convenient<br /><br />Pros- The bottom part of the case does not rise over the laptop<br />-Easy installation<br />-Does not cover the USB ports or any other entry and it has openings for the speakers!<br /><br />Con- Did not get the keyboard cover oh well<br />- the top case doesn't clasp on the top completely so if you have it shut and go to open your laptop youll be pulling on the case itself not the screen so make sure to grab both or you'll brake it off.<br /><br />WILL POST PICTURES LATER TODAY!<br /><br />8/28/15 UPDATE<br />So I just received another one I had purchased for my boyfriend and its a black one<br />same review as before only thing is the black one is more transparent so if you have<br />decals on the laptop they will show thru! :) ALSO i made a comment about the top<br />part of the case not clasping well when i got the black one it does so I looked at mine<br />again thinking maybe its diff kind i noticed IIIIIIII put it on the wrong way!!! LOL<br /><br />CASE IS PERFECT FITS WELL AND SEEMS LIKE ITLL HOLD UP! :)
3.0,Keeps the chip down to 47C.  The fins should be a little higher.
3.0,it makes a buzzing sound. it works though. i would recommend getting an original
3.0,For the time being it works ok.
3.0,"It's very heavy. I could tell more when I compared it to my roommate's case. Without the case, the weight of the tablet is halved and becomes much easier to carry. The case itself protects the tablet well though. It says the shipping weight is 4.8 ounces, I wonder if it is very much different from their other product that seems to be 4 ounces? Since the case just comes with a foam filler on the inside for protection, I don't know if the foam accounts for that extra .8 ounces in shipping or not. I'm wondering if I should try a different company or buy what seems to be the different version of the case made by the same company."
3.0,The case does a good job of protecting the Nexus 6. I like the kickstand even though it's a bit flimsy.<br /><br />My biggest complaint of that the case blocks the wireless charging from working. I have to remove it to use my Qi charger.
3.0,Ok
3.0,"When you insert it into a port it has a tendency to retract, not all the way but enough to have you checking the connection. No in use led."
3.0,Nice cover for adults but not as protected as I hope for children iPad
3.0,"If you're never going to be more than about 10 feet from the receiver, then you may never have a problem with this little unit. It should work exactly as advertised. However, once you get about twelve feet away, or worse, about 15, then you're looking at annoyingly intermittent reception of telemetry. I have this plugged into my HTPC, and if I need to click on something that doesn't take up 10% of the screen, I have to use my Logitech wireless mouse, because the &#34;airmouse&#34; is so ridiculously buggy at the distance my couch is from my computer. The rest of the features on this thing work well enough, especially at close range, but the airmouse feels like something better suited to a knock-off of a Nintendo Wii. Additionally, the hotkeys for the controlling media functions, like pause/play, fast forward, reverse, require pressing 2 keys, which are on opposite sides of the keyboard. If you have 2 free hands, that's not a problem, but if you're trying to be slick, and use it like a fancy, new-aged, next-gen, intuitive remote control, then you're out of luck. Maybe the next iteration of this decent device will see an additional Fn key situated on the side, where you could press it with a finger, while you hit the media function keys with your thumb."
3.0,The quality of the bag is really good but it has less space to keep things.
3.0,There is something wrong with the power key and the left ctrl key. The power button is stuck after being pressed and so does the left ctrl button. How to solve this problem????
3.0,Damages significantly after a year of usage. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,Great case
3.0,Seems like a really good backpack. Unfortunately the photo on Amazon does not meet match the product as of the date of this review.  The black backpack is actually black with lots of red highlights. Not a big deal unless you're buying this for a picky teenager!
3.0,It's a good capture card but it needs a setting for the gameplay chat
3.0,Don't buy if u r interested in working VGA on Mac . The computer won't recognize  it after it wakes up from sleep. Otherwise study make
3.0,"Ordered this case and I like it. However, I am missing the strap. Otherwise, I would have given this a 5-star"
3.0,"Not quite an exact fit, but it will do"
3.0,"Obviously a fake copy, but I expected it for the price. The game is still playable, and thats all that really matters to me."
3.0,A bad mix between a tablet and a PC. Not windows update to WIN 10<br />!
3.0,REALLY GOOD DID EVERYTHING I NEEDED IT TO
3.0,"Works well in my build, though the wifi card seems to be spotty. It will randomly turn off after computer is in sleep mode, requiring a wireless adapter reset. Adjusting the power saving settings temporarily fixes the problem. May replace card if problems continue.<br /><br />My build:<br />I3-4160, stock cooler<br />EVGA GTX960<br />Corsair 250d"
3.0,I like it - has lots of places to put things. 1 problem - the top right side corner ipad strip holds the UP volume button ON all the time. I don't like that. Can you tell me what's the work around - please.
3.0,"One speaker arrived leaking, which resulted not working.  However, considering what I paid I am not dissatisfied ."
3.0,It protects ok but only lasted 3 wks before the kickstand broke then the following week the back cracked. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,I can tell they're refurbished.
3.0,Not sure what I expected for the price.. Haven't been able to download any games or things like Netflix.  Everything else that is on it works as it should
3.0,new but doesn't fit first gen models
3.0,poor conectivity between keypad and taplet....
3.0,"It's just okay. It discharges pretty quickly compared to a HP original or a higher quality (higher price) battery. The dimensions and fit on my HP Compaq Presario CQ62 are just right. Works fine for a couple hours of low-intensity use, which was all I needed."
3.0,"The color is exactly what I wanted, the little keyboard cover is fun...feels cool when I type on it, but it is hard to see the Caps Lock is on, mildy irritating.  The fit of the case is EXTREMELY snug...could be a good thing if it didn't create hairline fractures getting it on. In short, the thin clip areas will soon begin to snap off as the computer bounces around. I suppose for $13 I'll just buy a few more."
3.0,"I don't know what to say...old one broke...this one, great price, great delivery, and my son says it is more powerful than my old one, but I noticed no difference... it WORKS,,, that...makes me h a pony...period"
3.0,item not satisfactory to my needs. slow charging on my iphone6 plus. guess because of only 3000 mah power. will not purchase item in the future!!
3.0,"Cool, breaks easy.. needs improvement... but its cool tho"
3.0,"Using as a little boys briefcase for church.  one of the snaps broke the day we got it, but he still uses it and I can force it closed.  The combination doesn't work, as in you can have it on any old number and it will open, but that's probably for the best when little boys are using it.  My son is 2 1/2 and loves to have a briefcase like Daddy.  Its small and light, although add a bible, song book, coloring book, a couple small toys and it gets a little heavy for him.  Great buy for a kid."
3.0,Fits the computer. Would not keep it safe if the computer were to fall on concrete but protects against scratches.
3.0,Neat idea in a world where you can't always trust your computer to not watch you.  I'm not paranoid but I am a technologist and I have children and I know I can't always make sure that they don't accidentally download a RAT or something else that might allow someone to peep on them.  So I just stuck these on their computers and told them to make sure to close them when they're not using them.
3.0,"not much volume capability, otherwise functional."
3.0,"Works well but has no Off and On Switch, The USP plug has to be extracted regularly to switch off and on"
3.0,Buggy
3.0,Not sure if it's working correctly.  I am having a hard time getting it to start my laptop up.
3.0,Its decent but blocks the edges of the tablet slightly.
3.0,does what its meant to do.
