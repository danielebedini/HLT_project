5.0,"I was very surprised at the high quality of the stitching, the sturdiness of the handles and the padding for my laptop. The price is amazingly low and the look is very good. I am quite happy with this purchase. It fit my MacBook Pro perfectly, with a little bit of room to spare."
5.0,"I am a Google employee and had to chance to use the device for a few months now. This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn’t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven’t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don’t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn’t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don’t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that.  5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

5.0,Excellent! Great value and does the job.
5.0,"Good quality,works well and compact size"
5.0,Replaced my Intel Centrino 2230 with the BCM94352HMB and it wasn't plug and play. A quick hardwired connection and searching for drivers brings up few options as Broadcom doesn't directly support drivers for these Wifi cards. You need to download from a major brand like Asus to acquire the driver I would google BCM94352HMB driver and go to the Wikidevi site and download the Wi-Fi Driver V6.32.223.1 for Windows 7 32bit & 64bit. Its an Asus driver and it works alot better than the Dell driver which I got connections drops with. With the Asus Driver no drops and a perfectly stable connection.<br /><br />Its a hell of an upgrade over the 2230 which is a piece of junk with problematic drivers. Intel makes good CPU's but terrible Wifi cards in the past few years.
5.0,Works well. I use this for my Skype meetings.
5.0,"The encryption software that comes preloaded is really easy to use, I wasn't expecting it to be on there, so that was a bonus."
5.0,"My first gaming mouse, and this thing is cool! You can customize the dpi, colors, buttons. Mouse is comfortable. With some tweaks on the DPI settings, this mouse is absolutely perfect. 10/10 would buy again. 11/10 with rice"
5.0,"Nice color, I love it"
5.0,product good
5.0,This does everything. A very handy item to have and use
5.0,"The first couple of days, this product was kind of noisy...after that break end period, quiet as a mouse. Love it."
5.0,Thank you
5.0,Works great to store my pics and videos!
5.0,Works well...small...doesn't take up space
5.0,"Works great, full speed at 150Mb/s on Comcast."
5.0,Card is very fast and works great. I am shooting with a canon 7D at full resolution with 18 megapixels.
5.0,Great protector case just sqeeze the sides and they pop open.
5.0,Excellent!!!
5.0,"I love this computer. The big screen, the speed is great and the placement of the keys are good. The only issue is the finish on top of the computer is not so good because it leaves fingerprint marks."
5.0,I had to make a few modifications as the hole for the button and the corners are not quite correct.  It took a number of fittings before it was acceptable.  Using a jewery grinder is not for the faint of heart as this is tempered glass and must be carefully worked so it does not shatter.  Shipped in a very stable container and was quickly delivered but the product could use a bit of refinement to properly fit.
5.0,I was pleased by the quality of the bag.  It is fashion forward and clean lines make it a great bag for men and women.
5.0,Nice little enclosure. Tool-less is a good thing
5.0,Plug and play just as the other reviews said.
5.0,Seamless installation on a Windows 7 system. Good reception despite there being several walls between it and the WiFi access point.
5.0,"Very reliable, better quality than what comes with the actual computer."
5.0,case is well made and keyboard comes in handy.
5.0,Love
5.0,Fits on my Dad's iPad well. He loves it. It feels like it was made pretty sturdy and the hand strap comes in handy.
5.0,Good mouse
5.0,"I will chime in to say that I have seen the same write/transfer speeds that other reviewers have posted. The drive might be a tad larger than some other flash drives, but the speed is several times faster than my other value-priced models. When transferring video files or a large collection of vacation photos, this drive turns a 15-minute task into a 30-second breeze."
5.0,Love it
5.0,Works
5.0,Very happy and totally satisfied with this purchase. A good quality and a perfect size  !
5.0,Works!
5.0,perfect
5.0,"I was hesitant to try putting a screen protector on my kindle fire after always ending up with bubbles with my phone screen protectors (generic brand protector), but this worked great! I did read the instructions and watch the video and it was so easy! Any small bubbles really did disappear after letting it set for 24 hrs! Absolutely recommend!"
5.0,Delivered as promised. Thanks.
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,I received the item quickly. I installed it using the cd provided and it works great.  It is so small that I forget that it's there.<br /><br />I recommend these for anyone looking for wireless USB adapter.
5.0,"Great sticker. I put it on my Lunch pail at work, so when I'm with a Patient in back of an ambulance it gives a great conversation piece as I educate people about Bitcoin"
5.0,"Fits my RCA Maven Pro 11.6&#34; with keyboard and has room in the front pocket for all my attachments (cords, headphones, etc.)  Beautiful print, seems to be well constructed."
5.0,Excellent quick service and a good product !
5.0,Awesome!!
5.0,The 3.3VDC and 5.0VDC outputs work well.  I could not get it to work with the ESP8266 module that I bought on eBay.  I am not sure which is at fault.
5.0,Great Keyboard for the price! Love the different color options and the fact that the shortcut buttons still work with my iMac! The mouse is smooth and definitely a positive experience for a gamer.
5.0,Great price for this amount of digital storage.
5.0,Love the purple cover. It keeps my kindle safe for taking pictures. I have another cover but have to move the kindle up to take photos.  This cover has opening for taking pictures.  I use this cover when traveling because it is sturdy and fits in my purse.  I am glad I purchased this cover and will purchase again the future.
5.0,I bought this for my 1 year old since her dad think it would be cool to give a 15 months old a ipad air. This case is life! My daughter has thrown her ipad quite a  few times but this case has it well protected & cushioned inside. I absolutely love it. Got the pink which is simple beautiful.
5.0,"Great product, performs well."
5.0,Great
5.0,"Works great, have this connected from my Thinkpad X1 Carbon OneLink Docking Station to an Asus 27&#34; LCD running at 2560x1440.  No issues, image quality is perfect."
5.0,Good replacement
5.0,"I am in no way a &#34;techie,&#34; but I needed storage for photos and work documents. This was easy to set up, as the steps are very intuitive. Files are easy to access (it has a Windows-type interface with folders for your files). It was exactly what I was hoping to find."
5.0,"This NETGEAR DSL Modem Router works perfectly with my AT&T DSL.  I understand though that those who have U-Verse, this D7000 will not work, so please be aware.  After following the quick setup guide and entering in my AT&T username and password, I was connected without any issue.  I couldn't be more pleased with the easy setup and the overall experience.<br /><br />I waited a couple of weeks to make sure I didn't have any issue, and 2 weeks later, it is still running flawlessly.  I am so happy with my new DSL modem router.  Lastly, I received this DSL modem router as part of NETGEAR Friends and Family program.  Had I not received it from NETGEAR, I still would have bought one to use anyways."
5.0,been using for months with no issues!
5.0,Works great. Badges iPhone 6 Plus at least 2 full times.
5.0,Excellent drives at a reasonable price.
5.0,Works greater
5.0,Easy to apply. Very satisfied :D
5.0,Fabulous!  Now my Chromebook is no longer a &#34;Chrome Desktop&#34; as the original Battery failed and I was tethered to the power Charger.  No significant weight increase and it actually makes a nice angle for typing / viewing.
5.0,My daughter loves it!!!  Beautiful!!
5.0,This is a wonderful case
5.0,"My son loves it.  It especially fast now that I have swapped out the original hybrid drive for a Samsung EVO SSD.  It is a shame that they sell these at all with a standard drive.  With the SSD, the computer boots in 5 seconds or less every time."
5.0,"I bought this bag looking for a briefcase that could double as a weekend travel bag, and this fit the bill perfectly. It is large enough to hold my laptop and research materials in one compartment, and a folded change of clothes in the other. The construction of the bag gets top marks, everything is well sewn or riveted, and any prior reviewers complaints about a stinky smell are unfounded. This is a genuine oiled leather product, and has all the character of such, like a good set of tack and saddle. The three buckles are great for securing for travel, but if you wish you can fold the outer two securing straps back under themselves and just rely on the center buckle for daily use. The bag will close, carry and function just fine with only the center strap buckled. Highly recommended for all."
5.0,Brought it for my daughter she loves it and it has met all expectations which isn't a surprise because all products presented and endorsed by Amazon are a great buy.
5.0,Does the job.
5.0,Works as advertised. Fast. Good
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,Like it!
5.0,very good :)
5.0,Great case! Would recommend.
5.0,excellent
5.0,"Fantastic battery for all applications! I use this battery primarily to power my programmable pan/tilt head (eMotimo TB3 Black) and Dynamic Perception slider for motorized timelapse camera moves. The battery lasts a very long time and I can trust it to power my motion control system even through very long shots that can last an entire day! I lost the power cable that it came with and couldn't quickly find the correct replacement cable online so I contacted Anker customer support via email. They replied to me on the same day (on a weekend) and pointing me in the right direction! I've also started carrying this battery in my bag every day as a backup iPhone/iPad charger and it has come in handy many times! I couldn't recommend this product any more. However, I see no reason to not buy the 2nd Gen as it's currently $10 cheaper on Amazon."
5.0,Perfect.
5.0,"Looks good, works well, and great price."
5.0,"works great,no problems whatsoever.thanks."
5.0,"Used for my ps4 ,works great"
5.0,"The equipment meets all my expectations, I am very satisfied"
5.0,Works great . Would buy again if I needed another.
5.0,A must have for your tablet. Easy to install and I love it.
5.0,I cannot figure out how to best use this item
5.0,excellent buy
5.0,"A very reliable monitor, without all the latest perks. I have three of them on my desk."
5.0,"works great. Love the way you can fold it in back , as shown in picture, and it makes into a stand. My IPAD cover does NOT do that ."
5.0,"It's cheap, it's small, and it moves air like a mofo. As long as you don't need to move it around a lot, it's perfect. The light is fairly bright, which might bother some if it's next to your bed, but we use it as a nightlight in our frontroom."
5.0,Works well for the iPhone.
5.0,Very good
5.0,Bought this case for my daughters HP Stream 13.  The case fits perfectly and is a very nice built case.  Much better than the neoprene ones.  I like the fact that the case is actually lined as may of the others were not.
5.0,"simple, sleek and does its job."
5.0,Great product - easily installed
5.0,"received it, cloned it, inserted it, booted it. SCREAMING fast!"
5.0,"Works good, just as advertised and very inexpensive.  My 15 mo old even likes them."
5.0,"Better than Otter-Box, and less than half the price!"
5.0,Reduces desk clutter and matches the monitor and my MACBook Pro perfectly.  Took about 60 seconds to install.
5.0,Easy to setup and install. Only concern is my past history with Netgear products which use Coax. They are very sensitive to power surges. Fingers crossed they've fixed that issue. Never once had a problem with Motorola/Arris modems.
5.0,good product
5.0,very cute
5.0,"Folks there is no better case for the iPad Air 2.  It's slim, sleek and solid.  The different angles that the case offers are very stable and do not slip. The vegan leather looks good and has a good grip/feel to it.  A great product all around.  Enjoy!"
5.0,"Fan replaced the original perfectly,"
5.0,"This is exactly as it looks in the photo. Very lightweight, folds up to almost nothing, and so for airline travel this could be a good choice.<br />Small enough to drop in a pocket.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, this reminds me of the easel style holders that 'collector's plates' used to come with.<br /><br />It works, and it's adjustable. However, this is not the most stable design of a stand.<br /><br />If you're somewhere that's not completely stable ( a sailboat table, an airline tray table) this won't be the most stable choice.<br /><br />But I like the extreme light weight and pocket sized compactness of this unit.<br />iGadgitz also offers a different model stand which is much sturdier and more stable. Made of Aluminum and a little heavier, but that one is my favorite design of Stand and I suggest you check that one out also.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy travels, everybody."
5.0,"I do a lot of photo processing in Lightroom and Photoshop,  and the wire between my tablet and p.c. was really annoying.  Now I don't have it draped across the tablet to reach the p.c. and life is good again. First, it was really easy to install,  30 sec. Max. The charge lasts for hours, and connect is automatic.  Interface is seamless.  If I do run out of charge, I can still use my tablet wired. GREAT ADDITION TO MY WACO TABLET!"
5.0,it works fine. thanks.
5.0,"Best computer on the market, and cheap too!"
5.0,"Personally bought this cpu for a gaming computer build that has been long overdue.<br /><br />Pros -<br />4 cores<br />Overclockable<br />More than enough for most gaming builds<br /><br />Cons -<br />Price<br /><br />After buying this and installing into my computer I have to say this thing is a beast compared to my old laptop (running a I7) after tinkering around with it I overclocked the cpu to 4.5ghz @ 1.258V stable. This cpu is great if you're looking for a upgrade and are still on the 1150 socket, otherwise i'd recommend spending the slight extra and getting the skylake cpus."
5.0,"I thought we would have to buy a new item to watch our laptop streams on the tv. However, this little cord fixed it! I simply love this. Wish I would have thought of this sooner!! Note: I received this product at a discount for an honest review."
5.0,All good!
5.0,Great product and my wifi speed has never been faster with better range as well.
5.0,"I ordered this keyboard for my new surface pro 3, and before it even arrived the company sent me an email letting me know to contact them for any problems or concerns. The keyboard actually arrived before my tablet so I connected it to my iPhone and it works amazing. It's a perfect size for what I need it to do, and it is very easy to set up. Very impressed, and will be buying more Jelly Comb products!"
5.0,"Initially heard about the HooToo line of products from a YouTube review and the feature set piqued my interest right away, it almost seemed a bit over the top for such a small product at the price point.  But it was exactly that price point that had me give it a go.  After reading various reviews and weighing my needs I decided to go with the HM-TM04.<br />The form factor is great, roughly the size of a Macbook Pro power brick.<br />What it does well:<br />Battery Backup -- works exactly as you would expect and maybe with a bit of a bonus.  As a real estate agent I am always on my phone and other devices so I have always carried an Anker 10,000mAh external battery bank to recharge my phone on the go.  The thing with the Anker battery back is that I have to physically push a button to get the charge to begin.  Not a big deal but there have been times where I would simply forget to push the button on the battery bank.  With the HooToo there are no buttons to push to charge a device,  just plug it in and it automatically starts charging.  No, it doesn't have the same capacity as the Anker but it's more than enough to recharge my phone and still have enough left over to do it's other functions for quite some time.<br /><br />Wireless router/Bridge -- This is the feature that sold me.  There will be times where I will go to a hotel or home where there simply isn't any wifi available and only having hardwired solutions.  That used to be fine when laptops had ethernet ports and no one had smartphones or tablets but now wireless is becoming more and more the standard.  Simply plug the ethernet cable into the HooToo, turn the HooToo on and bam, youre own wifi with it's own security so you can either keep the wifi to yourself or allow others to use it.  Fantastic for travel.  Ever go to a hotel or on a plane where they limit how many users/devices.  Pay once and bam, hookup as many as you want.  Also allows you to act as a wireless bridge.  Connect to a wireless network and output your own network, particularly nice so you don't have to sign in on every device you and your family has.  Sign in with the HooToo and everyone can automatically connect to the HooToo that they had previously signed into.<br /><br />AC Charger -- I admittedly don't use this too much but it can be nice for travel so you're not carrying a bunch of wall warts around.  The built in AC plug is nice as well, no more carrying around a wall wart adapter to charge the battery back up.  Just flip out the prongs and you're good to go, charge the battery backup all the while charging other devices.<br /><br />NAS -- Mass storage for all of your devices while on the go. Super simple, just plug it in and automatically available to anyone connected to the HooToo network.  Have tested with a thumbdrive to a external hard drive, works great for both.  Awesome for moving pictures/videos from your phone to the external storage without having to be connected to cell service or physically connected to a computer.  Great for vacations where your phone storage might be full and you want to take more pictures but not at the expense of deleting other pictures from the device.<br /><br />Software -- This is the HooToos major downfall.  The hardware is great but the software is fairly clunky.  It gets the job done and is functional but could use some UI/UX upgrades.  But they have updated it since I bought so it's at least being worked on and has improved over the months.<br /><br />For the price you really can't beat it.  It's not too much more than a standard battery bank but you get SO much more out of the HooToo."
5.0,Not bad for a mice below 20 dollars
5.0,"Ordered this for my husband, he loves it. We have been using this cover for years now."
5.0,cool cable
5.0,Very Pleased

5.0,The bag was exactly what I expected and fit my needs. I love the bag. the quality was actually better than I expexted.
5.0,Great item worked as posted great value and price would buy again
5.0,"great, work like charm"
5.0,Amazon next day delivery. Plugged in and all ports work.
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,Works great. I bought one off amazon that was delivered faulty. This was in a similar price range and was completely functional. This product is something I use while laying on the couch sine I have my computer hooked up to my TV. Comes with batteries.<br /><br />Sometimes the mouse has trouble moving if I use it against the couch instead of a mouse pad.
5.0,"Great value,  protection is great !"
5.0,Works great and exactly what I needed! The battery life is better than I expected even though it not a genuine apple battery! Recommend the product!
5.0,protection en good material
5.0,"As an electrical engineer I bought this for the male head in order to fix a wheel chair charger.<br /><br />As far as microphone sound quality I cannot comment but I can tell you how it works. The right pin is your hot wire (+) and the bottom is your return. After cutting the end off I was able to tell the the cable is shielded and the left pin along with the the shield are connected to the casing which prevents ground loops and reduces noise which should give you a quality signal.<br /><br />If you are just trying to use the head like I was for a wheel chair, a reconfiguration of the pins is in order."
5.0,"Update after 9+ months of ownership: I am hard on cables.  I had one cable end's insertion detent tab fail almost immediately.  The other 5 cables have each lasted 3-6 months of hard use.  I went ahead and purchased a set of shorter ones a few months ago.  Those do not get used as hard, and none have failed yet.  I really wish, though, that the micro end had an indicator of which side is top/bottom.  I have to put on my glasses to look at the end and determine which side is up.  That said, I am buying another set now.  I have purchased 6 of these cables and they have been uniformly great. I liked the first set week enough to purchase more.  Hard to tangle, easy to find, quality feel. The insertion detent on the micro end is a bit stiffer than some. Given that the failure mode of many similar cables has been that the micro connector becomes lose enough to fall out, I take this as a hopeful sign of durability."
5.0,good product
5.0,"I know others have issues with this unit but I love it. I think the design is inspired and I use it everyday. I have even purchased extras in case I misplace my first (which is not uncommon for me!) The top cover (little black piece inside top ring) did fall out which was disappointing but did not affect the performance of the unit and yes, where I place the unit on my phone frequently, does now have a bit of a mark (like a divot) on the edge of the phone but this in no way affects the performance of the unit or my phone. Unlike other stands I have tried this unit easily stores in my pocket and travels with me everywhere. My phone is not just a phone but my portable workstation so this Stand has been invaluable to me."
5.0,my daughter loves it
5.0,Love the keyboard!  Perfect for school. Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Great product just make sure you have the correct MAC size first time was wrong size.
5.0,"I've had this case for several years and still very happy with it. The case looks great, is very stylish and very functional.<br />It looks and feels like leather with a rich, brown appearance. Inside is a smooth, rich felt like liner.<br /><br />When you first open the case there is a flap that folds back for a few sheets of paper and an ID or business card. This a Tri-Fold Case and functions as a keyboard case and/or tablet case separately. The case covers the tablet screen when undocked and folds over the entire device, screen and keyboard when docked. There are cut-outs in exactly the right spots to access the wide assortment of ports.<br /><br />I plan to keep my ASUS 700T a bit longer and the also the case.<br /><br />This is an excellent case and I don't think you will be sorry.<br />The only suggestion I could make would be a pen holder of stylish holder."
5.0,Works like a charm.
5.0,"I bought this over a year ago, it still works great!"
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"fast, efficient."
5.0,Quick and easy! Works great.
5.0,This is a great product very sleek and small enough to take with you. The size concerns me just a little as it can get easily misplaced. Great products and I am going to purchase 3 more for my business.
5.0,Great!
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,"This square trade warranty replaced my Kindle after it was destroyed in hurricane Sandy. The whole process was easy and I had my new Kindle quickly.  I needed it again when I accidentally sat on my Kindle which I had forgotten in my back pocket.  Again, easy to use and I had the replacement before I lost interest in the book I was reading.  I only wish I could have purchased an extension on the warranty."
5.0,"This is my second order of this exact battery. The first one lasted me for 2.5 years before swelling up, which is exactly what my genuine apple battery did after a couple of years anyway, so that seems to be an apple defect that we all have to live with.<br /><br />This works great, fits great and the color matches the aluminum on my macbook pro perfectly. And considering that apple doesn't manufacture these anymore, this is a GREAT investment. And i's under $30."
5.0,"Terrific, Great outdoors and so very easy to use!"
5.0,Fast and silent
5.0,"This has to be one of the best case/covers for my macbook air 13. I just love the way it feels, and how simple it looks. Not to mention, it is easy installation and fits perfectly on the macbook air 13. Great product."
5.0,"Wonderful, my extra charger is a great buy! Thank you!"
5.0,"I personally love this case, everything about it. Ive spilled stuff on this case dropped it a few times my asus transformer book is still in perfect condition and this case cleans easy!!!"
5.0,"Works very well, length is exactly what I needed. Sturdy quality, would recommend."
5.0,"I own an Alienware mx 18 r2 and I have been hunting for a backpack that would both fit this behemoth laptop yet not weigh a ton. This is by far the greatest backpack I have ever had the pleasure of owning. It fits everything!  Two external drives, power, headset, as well as a plethora of other items - all with their own spot!  And it is COMFORTABLE!"
5.0,love it

5.0,"Awesome, drop it on the cement the other day. Nothing  is  wrong  with  the  tablet. Thank you ."
5.0,"Nice case, but hard to put on Kindle.  Arrived in timely manner."
5.0,"It took me a little bit to figure out that the front cover did not stay on the case, once I realized that the case did not keep the front cover on, I realized how it worked and it was great.  I was scared at first, I have to admit, but I have to say, it amazed me.  It works and it keeps the water out and is waterproof.  Love it!"
5.0,"Fantastic durable backpack. I get compliments all the time on it from both men and women! I am an executive and needed something cool and modern to wear to work and endure the long walk from parking lot to my corner office. Better than briefcase, but looks cool and youthful and classy. Better quality than $100+ backpacks I looked at. Highly recommend."
5.0,Worked right away once I plugged in my HP Laserjet 6p. I could not be happier

5.0,Got this tablet a month ago as a sample. I'm having a great experience with it. It has never lagged or such. Runs all my games smoothly.  I love the display and the graphics it gives.

5.0,Perfect fit to replace a worn out one.
5.0,"Used this ram on my old HP media center computer. I was looking to use it for some basic functions and run a few programs for my work. Of course the computer was slow and would lag a lot. With the add ram, it's so much quickerIIno issues now. Couldn't be happier for the price"

5.0,"My new My Book 6TB Hard Drive has virtually ended all my &#34;storage&#34; problems. My C: Drive was almost &#34;full&#34; and I've been able to transfer many, many GBs of information to my new 6TB external drive. Moreover, as I anticipated - it has also allowed me to make it my primary location for the two different Backup programs I run regularly.<br />To say the least... I am very pleased with my new My Book!!<br />David N Blondell"
5.0,Its compact and incredibly handy. Extremely functional if you have the need.
5.0,"This Bluetooth adapter works great with Windows 10. All I had to do was plug it into my laptop's USB port, and it automatically began working. So far I have used it with a Bluetooth speaker and a Bluetooth headset, switching between them several times. The connection is easy, quick, and reliable."
5.0,perfect
5.0,"Fits well, looks great, and works perfectly"
5.0,"Package arrive on 31Aug after placing an order on the 9th of Aug,<br />singapore.<br />it was bubble warped :)<br />thank you for the great service!<br />the quality of the decal is great is easy to use, it looks amazing on my mac!<br />THANKS!!"

5.0,"[[ASIN:B012VOO3U0 ASUS STRIX Radeon R9 380 Overclocked 4 GB DDR5 256-bit DisplayPort HDMI 1.4a DVI-D DVI-I Gaming Graphics Card]]<br /><br />Ah, the first one to review this jewel. I received  this card yesterday and have it installed on a ASUS X99 A/USB3.1 board. It is running perfectly. ASUS's tuning software is surprisingly good. After overall fan adjustments it runs at 39C which is quite good and is lower than any other card I have and  have used. For an OCed card this is impressive. The build quality and materials used are exceptional, fully automated assembly lines too ya know, and that is important to me. I bought a competitor's R9 280A and it has a white noise coming through the HDMI port that I use for audio only. Totally unacceptable. I sent it back 8 days ago to the retailer, ya know, Amazon's closest completer, by numbers only, and still haven't been able to resolve the return as they are stalling for really stupid manipulative reasons. Liars and thieves do those things. I will never buy anything from that retailer ever again and will pass the word everywhere. Amazon is the very best of the e-tailers, by a long shot, and Amazon Prime is a huge win. I have never had a unresolved issue with Amazon, and quickly too, and have been won over with their customer service and Amazon will get it all, if possible, from me. The card is excellent. You guys and gals know what this card can do and I'm not gonna write performance specs.

5.0,Really cute and fast.
5.0,Awesome!
5.0,Really pretty case and fits perfectly. Would buy it again
5.0,Great for cutting glare and fingerprints
5.0,Everything is fine I gave you this review before please do not torment me with another request for a review thank you
5.0,Good product.
5.0,The Kindle would charge extremely slow plugged into even my iPad adapter. Now it's chafing normally again. Worth the purchase.
5.0,Love it!!! Love the magnetic backing on it. no priblems to speak on the phone once u open it and the phone rings. excellent quality and real pretty color.
5.0,I put this on my keychain and have used it daily for a year with zero issues. It is very rugged.
5.0,Great quality for the price paid.  I'm very happy with my purchase and the keyboard covers fit incredibly well---and ARE compatible with the 11&#34; Macbook Air. :)
5.0,"I bought a slightly modified version of this CybertonPC and it's awesome.  Super fast, no issues, solid state drive upgrade and great customer service. I will definitely buy again."
5.0,Absolutely amazing! It is a device that I always dreamed of.
5.0,"Great case! In my opinion, it is nicer than Apple's smart case.  It doesn't have as much of a border as the Apple case does, which makes it thinner and better looking"
5.0,Good
5.0,Up and running in no time at all. SWEET machine!
5.0,Love that i can leave it pluged into my computer and not worry bout it snagging something or breaking off
5.0,works as expected
5.0,"Really good inexpensive router, but my use was for basic speed cable, not 10+ mbps, so I cant speak to its performance beyond that"
5.0,Absolutely a pleasure...
5.0,I've been using it for 3 months now and 100% recommend this sturdy notebook stand.
5.0,Great wireless access points.  Thank your for the quick shipping.
5.0,Works great and arrived a day early!
5.0,"So far...so good with this silent little mouse. No strain on the carpal and the wheel is also silent<br />and of ease in use. Although a bit pricier than most computer mice, it will be more than worth every<br />dollar if this device holds up over the long haul (2-3 years and beyond with normal use)."
5.0,This is a great backpack with a million clearer little spaces
5.0,"I love this speaker. The sound quality is great for such a small speaker. I have taken this thing on many vacations, dropped, smashed and it’s still going strong. The exterior is a nice soft touch material. Also, you can listen to music while you are charging it. Some people have mentioned limited battery life. I have a travel battery I carry with me, cost 25 bucks, plug that in and you could listen to music for days. This thing is so awesome my mom stole it."
5.0,"This mouse is amazing!  It is perfect for the computer gamer.  I purchased this for my son that loves to play alot of action type games that require shooting and quick movement.  This mouse is a nice size and fits nicely in the palm of your hand leaving the controls u need at your fingertips.  It has 6 buttons which have been perfect for my son for such a games as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and many others.  It also has the great perk of the little scroll/mouse wheel.  It is also very nice as it is lit up a pretty blue color.  It is also made of a nice material that is not harsh on your hands.  It comes with a nice 5 ft cord so you can use it from a bit of a distance.  It is a very nice looking mouse and your friends will think you have spent a fortune on it.  I am very impressed with the quality of this mouse and would recommend it to the online gamer for sure.  I was fortunate enough to receive this mouse free for my honest unbiased review."
5.0,Does the job and looks great.
5.0,Does what it should
5.0,"This product is a great value. It looks clean and professional; when closed, it provides outstanding protection, and when open, you can prop it at several angles."
5.0,Battery fit and charge in my  modem with no issues.I recommend this product.  Have had for couple of months and it still works fine
5.0,ok
5.0,very good
5.0,"Does exactly what is suppose to do. Easy to read, Easy to set up. Easy to download books. NICE!"
5.0,Best of the sub 20 dollar mini remotes I've tried.
5.0,very good.But why i do not have packing slip？
5.0,Does the job. Reliable.
5.0,"Very nice case a little on the heavy side , but offers great protection"
5.0,I lost a screw in my MBP when I had to open it up to fix a problem I was having.  These screws fit perfectly and it was cheaper to buy the three pack than a lot of single sets I've seen online.  The package also included a free Velcro cable tie.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,The case is beautiful and fits my iPad perfectly. The color is more of a light brown gold (which I was actually looking for a true gold) but other then that this is a great case and I love it.
5.0,Great deal
5.0,Did what I needed. No issues.
5.0,"fine, no problem with this item, thanks"
5.0,"This works great for my laptop, its nice and small and hooks up with no problems"
5.0,CHrages great and and fast
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"I work in an IT department, and multiple monitors is an absolute necessity! There's a lot of IT guys who get crazy and run 4 to 6 monitors, but everyone on my team is satisfied with just 2 large monitors. I purchased 6 of these for my guys, and everyone loves them. We have been using them for about a month with no problems. They were plug-and-play so the set up was effortless, and if I need to leave my office I just have to unhook my charger and the docking stations USB. I will purchase these in the future if I need anymore docking stations, and I would also suggest these to anyone who's trying to hook up multiple monitors to a laptop but still wants to stay organized."
5.0,It's a little pricey but you get what you pay and with speaker it speaks volumes! Works great easy to use and loud!
5.0,Fits perfectly and light weight.
5.0,Good product!
5.0,"I really only bought this for the case itself and figured the keyboard cover would be cool to have too, but this came with both of those and a trackpad cover. It's a good deal for the price but I ended up just throwing away the trackpad cover, and the keyboard cover stretches and rips over time. I'm giving this a five star review for the case itself because it fit perfect and isn't really something that gets in the way while using my laptop. I like that the edges fit flush and it has ventilation holes. I took off the bottom part of the case to look at what model I had and noticed that the ventilation holes will attract some dust particles but it's not too much and it's pretty easy to clean. I will also note that this will add a little weight to your macbook but it's hardly noticeable."
5.0,very good price!
5.0,A great starter kit for anyone getting into electronics. Goes great with an arduino!
5.0,"excellent reading speed, good packaging."
5.0,Works great on my 13 inch st13 smartab
5.0,Works just like it says in info commercial.
5.0,"There is no doubt that this is an excellent purchase for my iPad. Tough and robust. Thus, I feel confident this case not only has a good looking but also protects my tablet well."
5.0,"Easy to connect and install (plugs into USB).  It does not auto install with Windows 7 but the driver with the included CD (mini) installs flawlessly.<br />Picked up the network and connected without issue.  I received this for review and its a pretty solid useful device.  This is an IT essential if you do any kind of computer support, we have laptops with NIC that go bad and require a repair, using this, we can allow the user to continue on with therir laptop until a replacement arrives."
5.0,Perfect fit. Nice price and quality
5.0,Perfect size for all of our portable paperwork.  We keep everything in it that we'd need if we had to leave the house quickly.  It carries it all.
5.0,best cast ever
5.0,Simply amazing!
5.0,"Setup is nontrivial...I'm mechanical, and this is not a short install. Plan on 30 or 40 minutes. But that only hurts once, and the quality of this ergo arm is top rate. Solid as a rock, adjusts with a finger, looks like it will last the better part of a century. Very pleased. This is holding a 27&#34; monitor that needs to swing 90 degees side to side, multiple times per day, to share onscreen content."
5.0,"Good product, fast shipping"
5.0,If you purchase the correct drive for your model the drive is almost flush with the chassis when inserted. There is a slight raise to it but nothing that sticks out obtrusively like many other removable media devices. See attached photo of drive fully inserted.<br /><br />I use mine mainly for my iTunes library and it works great for this purpose.
5.0,"Laptop is a good bang for the buck. No optical drive, so no dvd. No card reader. But I salvaged my old laptop hard drive and dvd burner and they work flawlessly. Also upgraded to Windows 10 without incident."
5.0,a
5.0,Great product for the price.  It was a tight fit at first but stretched to perfectly fit my HP Stream after a few days. I have no complaints what so ever!
5.0,"I absolutely love this keyboard, it had all the features I was looking for. Chiclet style keys, multi-colored back-lit functionality, macro keys, usb ports and the added plus of having mic/audio ports as well as a fan. (Even though I rarely use the fan.)<br /><br />The only thing that I do not like about this keyboard are how some of the keys are designed. The space bar, enter, ctrl keys, tab, backspace, forward slash key, enter on numpad, + key on numpad, capslock and the shift keys. They are designed with a metal retention bar that spans across the bottom of the key to keep it level when you push the key down. Over repeated use on one side of the keys, like the space bar for instance, it will wear out the plastic clamp section that holds the bar in-place. Once that wears out, the key will be nearly un-operational (by pressing it on one side, rather than the center.) unless you use tape or something to hold it. I used electrical tape to repair the spacebar and enter key, which I should have gone with a clear tape so it isn't as noticeable, but it gets the job done and it doesn't bother me much.<br /><br />Other than the design flaw on some of the keys it works nicely, I would recommend getting a warranty from squaretrade or something to cover the life span of the keyboard. I have owned this keyboard for a little over a year and besides the enter and space keys wearing down a bit (probably from applying too much force as I type fairly hard sometimes.) it still works great.<br /><br />I attached some images to show you how some of the keys are designed. The key I used to show you is the right shift key. The metal bar goes across the back of the key then slides into the arms (or whatever you want to call it) onto the keyboard to allow, I suppose, a &#34;smoother&#34; button push response."
5.0,Quality is excellent. I am very satisfied with the purchase.
5.0,"Works great for AARP RealPad.  Only thing is no hole for camera, but it is easy to get case off & back on."
5.0,I bought this to protect my MacBook and it is doing exactly that! I ended up buying one for my mom because she loved how the case looked with the MBP
5.0,I just received my product today. Just in time for school too! It arrived a lot earlier than expected. The product is soo pretty!!! It's not real leather but it feels like it. My computer fits perfectly. Im impressed. I bought the turquoise one. Its really bright but thats what makes it so pretty!!
5.0,Exactly as advertised.  Works great.  Arrived on time.
5.0,These are a great length for charging. They allow you to get up and move around (albeit only 6 feet) while charging and using your phone at the same time.
5.0,I recommend excellent product. All very good
5.0,"Works perfect in my Galaxy S5, was able to add more memory to my phone easily."
5.0,I received this item quickly. It's a quality cover that fits my 11&#34; MacBook Air snugly as I beleive it should. It also has a good balance of cushion without being overly bulky. I am very pleased with my purchase!
5.0,Was exactly what my son wanted and was delivery very quickly! Very happy with the product!
5.0,"I was looking for a replacement for my 3 year old tablet that wouldn't cost too much when I found this one. I couldn't be happier with it. Where my old tablet was slow and underpowered, this one is fantastic. There is no noticeable delay when I turn it on or open apps. Everything seems to just work as it should. The screen is bright and the images crisp. The sound is excellent, too with dual speakers. The front and rear cameras both work great and I'm rediscovering the joy of taking random pictures throughout my day. If you're in the market for an 8-inch tablet you should really give this one a try."
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT
5.0,Working great for me .No issues whatsoever in pairing with my devices.  Very good receiving range.
5.0,Flawless!  Worked great out of the box.
5.0,Wow fast processor. Idles at 10 Celcius with the ARCTIC Freezer 13. Brrrrrr!
5.0,It is perfect for my daughter's MacBook! It's very protective on the inside too.
5.0,"Installed this into a Thermaltake Core X1 case.  It went in flawlessly.  Popped in an Intel i5 4690K, set multiplier to 42 and BAM!  Up and running at 4.2GHz.  It also recognized the XMP for my G.Skill Sniper 1866 memory without a problem.<br /><br />Be careful if installing an aftermarket cooler.  The capacitors closest to the socket set maybe a mm higher than the processor so it's easy to catch the edge of the cooler on them and not have good contact with the CPU."
5.0,Delivered as expected.
5.0,I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0,It works well in my deer camera.
5.0,"I'm pretty darn happy with my Amazon Basics laptop bag.  I've had it for 6 months now.  While it doesn't get hard daily commuter use, I do tote it around quite a bit.  It's roomy, has lots of pockets and the overall construction of the bag seems decent.  Also, you can't beat the price!"
5.0,great price!
5.0,These are awesome.
5.0,"I've had this hub 7.5 years and it's still going strong. Wish I could find the base now, because I'd like to stick it to the desk. That's my fault, not the device's. This is a great hub. I've had no problems whatsoever with it."
5.0,"Fits fine, and makes my Mac look great , and protects it , which is &#34; most&#34; important . Two little added bonuses , a key pad cover , and extra pads for the four skid pads . Mosiso has followed up to make sure i'm pleased with my purchase  and if not , to make it right . ,"
5.0,"Provides nice crystal clear screen protection, and easy installation. Highly recommend, this may be a little more expensive than others but worth it."
5.0,With several ebboks in the Windows Store this makes a wonderful tablet to read on. This was a free trial so i got the AMazon Kindle app to read with. I can use all the amazon ebooks on my Windows tablet. The tablet is fast and never crashes on me. I never have any issues with mutli tasking either.
5.0,"Got here on time, it has taken me a little while to find the 1 TB hard drive; split between C & D drives."
5.0,Good product. Great price!
5.0,Satisfied with the product
5.0,i got this for my Mac Book and it is so cute.  It has a very pretty design on it that is simply stunning.  It has such pretty colors and graphics on it.  I totally love butterflies and had to have this when i saw it.  My mac has sadly suffered a few scratches from day to day usage.  I am glad that have found this to protect my computer from further damage.  It is made of a nice durable plastic and I feel that I will not have to purchase another case for my computer unless i decide to change the design.  This fit my computer perfectly and does not block any of the ports at all.  It was very easy to install with a nice snap on design so anyone can do it and is easy to remove as well.  Comes with rubberized dot for the bottom to make it non slip which is also very nice.  I cannot stress it enough the design on this case is simply stunning and you will be very satisfied with this purchase as well.  I received this item free for my honest unbiased review.
5.0,"With the upgrade to Windows 10, I am totally satisfied.  Big keyboard, number pad, sound, Internet.  All working beyond what, a short time ago, could not have been possible for $300."
5.0,Excelente...
5.0,Perfect for my galaxy s6 edge since there are no more SD cards. Very fast storage and super intuitive interface. Auto detected by most phones and makes transferring files to friends super easy.
5.0,Great item.  I will get it again.
5.0,Great upgrade.  Works flawlessly.  Easy install.  I would highly recommend.
5.0,Easy to install and works perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful

5.0,"I am a klutz and being a klutz, I drop or crush everything, doesn't matter how precious or valuable it is. So when I got my iPad 2, I knew I needed a protective case because, without a doubt, I knew I would break it within the first week. I searched around and, having decided that I wanted something stylish but minimalist and sleek, I wanted to try this case. It arrived in a plastic sleeve to keep it safe in transit and there's foam inside so that it's perfect when it arrives. The iPad 2 fits in it beautifully. This case is extremely slim but quite effective and it's also super sturdy! It fits beautifully and the pale blue dandelion pattern is really beautiful. My favourite colour also happens to be blue so this goes with most of the other cases on my essential electronics. I find this case to be a bit easier to use than the ones I have used in the past, better use of buttons and it shows the logo out the back. I've had a few people tell me how much they like it. True to form, I have already dropped my iPad 2 and sat on it and this case has taken the beating for it! I never have to go in fear of breaking my tablet now. If you, like me, need some extra protection for your iPad 2, you cannot go wrong with this.<br /><br />I received this for free in exchange for a genuine critique"
5.0,It fits perfectly and perfect for traveling
5.0,love this item....would recommend
5.0,"Great product. Very easy to set up, and very reliable! Don't bother using the included 3M velcro patch if you're going to place it on a machine that heats up, because it will separate from the adhesive."
5.0,"Six foot length is great. It's a power cord, it supplies power. Not much else to say about it. First one was defective but seller immediately processed a replacement cord at no cost to me and the second one works perfectly, so I am 100% satisfied. Will buy again when main laptop's power cord gives out and I need to replace that one as well. Great price too, fast shipping."
5.0,This router works perfectly and for such a cheap price.
5.0,Just as said works fine
5.0,Well made looks to last
5.0,its a good Book its working fine.
5.0,Perfect gift idea!
5.0,Very nice web cam. Good video and audio. I like they way it tracks your movement.
5.0,"Simply stated, this thing is totally practical and useful in the everyday-use kinda way, as I explain below. If you hold your iPad for more than an hour a day, you'll so appreciate how much easier it is with this thing. I use this everyday and it has been a life saver for me. The CoulVue holder is the easiest, best value way to hold your iPad effortlessly and securely. If you've ever dropped your iPad, or come close, this thing is totally worth its price. If your kids use an iPad and you've ever thought they might drop it, this thing goes a long way towards easing your mind. If you usually only use your iPad indoors, in air conditioning, sitting down, maybe at a table or desk then you can use this holder as a ipad stand. The handle is removable and durable. It feels comfortable in your hands. This is the best, light weight and handy option to use you ipad safely. As a blogger I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies, just as in this case in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
5.0,"Well took more than three minutes only bec of install location, but what a breeze. We continue to have drop off with Comcast's To Infinity and Beyond ...Blast so we have had to reset the Almond, yet another breeze. Best yet, purchased the Almond bec the highest end Netgear or Arris/ Motorola modem/router combos weren't strong enough to send signal from our basement office! With the addition of the Almond surprising got out of my Explorer last week and noticed I was connected to...you ready...the Almond. My son Jon is a gamer so needless to say carries his laptop throughout the house...with the Almond, no more &#34;this internet sucks&#34;! We have over an acre of land, yes Almond covers it! Only problem is ...hope the the neighborhood never finds out and jams us up! The only negative side of the Almond is it needs to depend on the corporate Big Boy internet providers that rip your pockets apart to get your money for mediocre service loaded with excuses and sincere apologies! Yeah right!"
5.0,"I got this in January 2015. It is currently August 30th 2015 and the casing still is in good quality. There are a few scratches, but that is my fault. Overall, it was easy to install and the key board cover it came with are both very durable and good quality. Also, the color of the case and keyboard case perfectly matches with my gold iPhone 6+."
5.0,"Friggin. Amazing. Love this thing. I have 32TB of storage and all kinds of capability now. Love the fact I can segregate partitions and setup LDAP or Active Directory services right on the NAS. Also lets me encrypt any or all of the volumes and segregate permissions just like a windows server. Fast, reliable and so far ZERO issues. Love this thing. I have only see one (not really an issue) complaint and that is the IP camera software app only comes with 2 channels, meaning I can only record 2 cameras at one time. Still does it without much complaint though and even does playback very nicely. The four NIC's are setup as one huge 10GB ethernet channel and I am lovin life."
5.0,Works good. Cord is a little short and its hard to detach from the wrist band but other than that it is a great product for the price!!
5.0,"Nice chassis for the money. There are fancier ones out there, but you don't have to spend the bucks for it."
5.0,I love my new case.  Has all the features I was looking for plus comes in a great color.  And a bonus stylus.
5.0,The cooling fans works like a charm.
5.0,"The keyboard for my iPad Air works perfectly.  I have no 'real' complaints.  It snaps in via the magnetic latch very well, securing my iPad in place.  I am able to type freely, as if I am using a laptop.  I do wish that while typing that the keys weren't so loud. I know it's the norm, and possibly can't be avoided.  However, I do not believe the previous brand I used was heard so much.  That is the only downside...  I have to type slower so as to not disturb anyone (in a quiet room)."
5.0,Exactly as described. Price and quality is perfect.
5.0,You can't go wrong with the price.  I have ordered about 100 of these.  Excellent!
5.0,Perfect case for your mac book pro. It doesn't make the computer much heavier but it still protects it very well. The keyboard cover fits perfectly and the product is made of good material. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,Thanks
5.0,working perfect
5.0,Love it
5.0,"Excellent product for small tablets, cell phones etc.Product exactly as described!  Fast delivery!"
5.0,"This 3.5&#34; drive plug and played on a refurbished computer OK and I've had no problems with it. It is inexpensive, packaged nicely, and seems to be built well."
5.0,Great product. Exactly as described.
5.0,was a great buy worked great granddaughter loves it also
5.0,Excellent light. Very bright. I'm very happy with this brand!
5.0,"This fan works great, and is very effective keeping the laptop significantly cooler.  Fairly low noise as well.  Be sure to try and clean out the laptop vent that can get lots of dust in it.  Easy to install also, with multiple gaskets to choose from for a good fit."
5.0,It arrived earlier than expected and works fine.
5.0,Love my Kindle.  It is so small and so easy to carry in my purse.  Holds a charge for days.  Highly recommend this item.
5.0,Nice looking and functional; Perfect Fit and Great price
5.0,"The product came in very quick and it is definitely doing its job, great pick up!"
5.0,"Got this for my new Kindle fire HDX 8.9 & am very pleased. Has all ports easy to access, keyboard works terrific & very easy to set up and case is good quality leather & very sturdy doth good padding & a great deal in the price. I give it a thumbs up so if you're on the fence this works great for me."
5.0,I'm learning to enjoy it!
5.0,Great replacement for original that I lost.
5.0,Beautiful and great quality case! My ipad stands up perfectly.
5.0,Excelente!
5.0,"Don't waste your money on others. Go with the Intel Core i7. For the money, this is great! Fast and smooth running. Would've been nice to hav 5th gen, but you can't get better for the money."
5.0,"awesome, fits macbook air 13&#34; perfectly"
5.0,"This is my 4th Kindle.  I started with the Black/White with keyboard, graduated to the 7&#34; Kindle Fire, graduated to the 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire H.D. (used it for almost 3years) and just recently upgraded to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX.  Each time I have upgraded I have been extremely pleased.  The features on this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 that I am really enjoying is the processing speed and the addition of being able to use Bing for searching.  I continue to choose the Amazon Kindle products because of the reliability and great customer service."
5.0,"The keyboard, which I am typing on at this very second is very quiet, but still has the audible click that I enjoy so much from mechanical keyboards, only toned down. It's nice for not waking up my roommate early in the morning. For the cost, the keyboard is definitely worth it. The only thing I disliked about the keyboard at first was that the space bar was different from my last keyboard and required a bit more force for the keyboard to register the hit, I adapted to the difference in about a week or so and I absolutely love this keyboard. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a very high quality keyboard (I had a 100$ mechanical keyboard before this one that is on par with this one) without paying a ridiculous amount of money.<br /><br />As an added note, while I have not spilled anything on my keyboard as of yet, the added benefit of having the drainage holes is very nice."
5.0,"Yes its difficult to configure, but no access point will give you the range of the ECB3500. You can now get the newer N model trimed in black but the range is no where near as good. If you turn it up all the way as both the stock firmware and DDWRT allow you will have a shorter life but ec=ven at the factory settings it blows all normal wireless out of the water with it's high output and long antennas. Very hard to find new the final price of New Eggs last batch is up to over $250 from the original price of around $100. Had one for years and the newer one ECB350 G-N at $69 pooped out on me after 1 year although it was faster but range lowers the speed rate and the G powerhouse were talking about should give youa great signal if properly placed in a very large house."
5.0,"Fit is perfect, look is exquisite. Just what I was looking for"
5.0,"Fast, fast, fast delivery, the instrument was exactly as I needed it.  thank you"
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,I used this product to get home videos off of a Sony camcorder and it worked very well. I had no problems using this product whatsoever and would highly recommend it.
5.0,"It works! Audio comes through nice and clear. Im not experiencing any buzzing, static, or hissing. Havent tested the mic out but i have no reason to believe it wouldn't work. The buttons feel solid. The led on the unit is a bit bright so you might want to cover that up with tape or something."
5.0,Works great! Perfect length cord
5.0,"It's perfect, the lid folds into a triangle that holds the note up perfectly, lightweight."
5.0,The signal is great and its easy to setup.
5.0,I like it. Getting use to page turner. Shopping could be improved. It is harder than the original
5.0,"I've only had it for about a week but so far I love it, it's small and I am able to put it on a lanyard or any keychain - this i exactly what I was looking for. For the price the amount of space it can hold is unbelievable, I recommend this product to all those looking for a cheap, small USB."
5.0,The 8-bit port is working good.  No trouble since I installed it.
5.0,Fits snug. Color is beautiful. I love it. My school colors are deep purple gray and white. I opted for the pastel.
5.0,"Good product, good price."
5.0,"Having become frustrated finding a good mouse that is wired and doesn't require changing batteries, issues with Bluetooth, etc. I have been unable to find a reasonably priced mouse that would meet the need. After searching, I came across this mouse that, for the price, sounded too good to be true.<br /><br />However, now that I have been using this for my work corporate laptop, which doesn't allow for user installed drivers, I am happy to say that this mouse does appear to be everything proclaimed.<br /><br />* It feels good in the hand and has a good weight to it<br />* It worked instantly on Windows 7 w/o any drivers or support software<br />* It is accurate and doesn't seem to have any mechanical issues, at least not thus far, that make using it frustrating or difficult<br /><br />Overall, I happy with the mouse... or as happy as one can be with such a commodity item.<br /><br />if asked, I would recommend to a friend or family member that had similar interests to those that drove me to select this item."
5.0,"Great product, works flawlessly so far. I liked ! I am happy with this purchase"
5.0,Works great.
5.0,Very fast loading from my Wifi camera to the tablets
5.0,"Excellent unit.  The versatility of this tablet, besides being competitively priced is a solution to the elderly.  Poor eyesight and physical disabilities associated with age and using the supporting add on features allows the user to stay in touch with our changing world.<br />A realistic add on keyboard that you can see and use.<br />I cannot wait to use my Fire HD7 to show computer created work sheets and class instructions to my students. (HMDI) Good by to copiers and reams of paper, Farwell to those costly printer inks!<br /><br />Oh yes I have much more to gain back.  Just takes a little effort to learn more, open a book and read.<br />Noel"
5.0,nice!
5.0,Worked as described and super easy to install.  Doesn't come with the locking bracket that hooks onto the locking switch on the bottom of the laptop.  Although it's easily removed from the CD drive and attached to the hard drive caddy via 4 small Phillips screws.  Keep in mind this is the model that has the hard drive status led on the outside of the bezel.  It is blue while the drive is inactive and red when the drive is active.  If I could change one thing about the product I would just remove the blue led from the status light because I feel like it would fit in with the red/black theme of the laptop better.  Other than that it's a great cost effective alternative to the more expensive OEM adapter.
5.0,work as expected. used to hook an old monitor to my new Dell micro PC.
5.0,Fit perfect and was great for an adult. I dont see it working well if you drop it. Perfect for my elderly aunt.
5.0,"Awesome product.  Self installed on Server 2003, Windows 10, and windows 7.  Easily swapped for our older drives that had historical data.  great for backups/ automatic backups as well."
5.0,LOVE IT!!!!
5.0,Installed it in my Samsung 5 active for additional space. works great!
5.0,clean looking and works great and great price
5.0,Excellent Product.  Would buy again.
5.0,"For the price, a great product!  It paired right away with my iPad 2 using bluetooth, and the keyboard works very well.  Looks nice, love the ability to adjust the angle to so many positions.  Note--this is (in my view) an affordable product, not a lux, Apple-type keyboard.  Materials are not Apple-level.  BUT, it's exactly what I needed for the job."
5.0,Exactly what I need to store my many media files from my son's 1st year in band and my ministry videos.
5.0,Great
5.0,Thanks
5.0,I just got it in today 8/31/2015. The battery itself is in great condition and came earlier than the expected dates (Sept.1-4). The battery was already at a 51% charge and was read immediately for my Acer Aspire 7745g-6572. So if you really do need to use it immediately you can. It's on a huge discount so that's a plus. I'll try to keep this updated for the long term pros/cons.
5.0,"I like it... Runs smooth at 1080 games like The Witcher with somethings on Ultra, also TitanFall"
5.0,"I was running my Intel Core I7-4770K with the stock cooler, which seemed to be failing. At times, the CPU would hit 60 deg. C at idle, and under full load would run as high as 100 deg. C with throttling. It was also a bit loud.<br /><br />Installed the NH-U14S, and now it idles at around 35 deg. C and hits 60 deg. C at full load, overclocked to 4.3GHz. And, it's incredibly quiet. Obviously, that's a great result. Installation was very easy and high-quality, although note that if your case doesn't expose the rear of the motherboard, you'll need to remove the motherboard to install the cooler. And, it's quite large--make sure it'll fit your case and RAM. Mine is very tight.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5.0,Thank you. Allowed me an inexpensive repair to keep the machine alive.
5.0,"My son says its just great , made his day on his birthday !!"

5.0,I had no problems with the memory.  They are exactly as described that even my 15 year old was able to install them.

5.0,"Everything was good, timely and in working order."
5.0,"I first used bag balm during the 1950s when milking my grandpa's cows. Grandpa insisted that it was applied during each milking. Of course, I assumed it was only for the cows. During my 30s, I heard from a friend that it worked well for his feet during hunting. I too, had been plagued by blisters, especially on opening day of pheasant season, so I started using bag balm and it really helped!<br /><br />Now in my late 60s, and plagued by dry, cracking skin, I use bag balm often and find it is a real remedy - great product!<br />Chris Gregory, Tekoa WA"

5.0,I bought this for my nephew.  He has been using it since and have not heard any issues with it.

5.0,"Arrived on time, works fine with no issues. It attaches firmly to my video card and monitor with no wobble."
5.0,"IT works.  The housing and cable material does not feel robust, but for ham shack install it should suffice.<br /><br />I mainly use this with RMS express to control my aging IC-737.<br /><br />For RMS Express, the vital things you need to know about your radio/PC:<br /><br />What channel for rig control:  IC-737 used &#34;3CH&#34;<br />What COM port the USB assumes"

5.0,"The Corsair STRAFE Cherry MX Red Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a well-made wired gaming keyboard that employs the latest technology (with respect to the backlighitng display and keystroke capture) and is offered at an affordable price. Typing is smooth and--relative to other mechanical keyboards--relatively quiet. The textured spacebar and textured WASD keys (provided but not installed) are comfortable and good for keeping your fingers oriented. The red LED lighting effects are impressive but not really necessary. The two USB cables provided (only 1 needed for USB 3.0) are thick and should be durable. I used the on-keyboard USB port for my mouse, with no problems. All keys are programmable, but no special keys are provided unless you count the FN key to the right of the spacebar that replaces the right Windows key. The FN key allows you to use the media controls that are combined with the function keys along the top of the keyboard--something you often see on laptops. Compared to Corsair's fancier models like the K95 I purchased a while back, Corsair has shaved money and space off of this keyboard by omitting the bank of dedicated programmable keys, replacing the brushed aluminum case with plastic, omitting the dedicated media keys (and other special keys, like those for macro recording or profile-switching), and dropping the wrist rest. The included 8 textured keycaps (WASD, QWERDF) and keycap puller, however, are a nice perk. The keyboard uses the Corsair Utility Engine software, which has lots of options and can be rather intimidating to new users (including me). The software and documentation do not ship with the keyboard but are easily downloaded from Corsair's web site. There is essentially no documentation on the hardware, however.<br /><br />One more note on the comparison to the K95: Although the Strafe technically has better anti-ghosting and rollover, I didn't notice any improvement in steering my roller or in swapping weapons in Defiance--the areas where I had previously had the most problems. (Defiance was the game I played most frequently during testing.) The reason may be that my problem is network lag rather than the keyboard; if you're playing online and the network lag isn't significantly shorter than the keyboard lag, a faster keyboard isn't going to help you.<br /><br />Bottom line: Solid keyboard, but MMO gamers and some others may find the lack of extra programmable keys to be problematic. Also, if you really need a spectacular lightshow from your keyboard, you should hold out for an RGB model. And while everybody is skimping on technical documentation these days, a short hardware manual does not seem too much to ask for.viously had the most problems.

5.0,great replacement battery. Works like a charm for now.
5.0,"This mouse works just as advertised. Very quiet, no hassle, plug and play. I like the small USB adapter ."
5.0,Does the job.
5.0,"This is a very useful tool kit for people that like to work on equipment. This has everything I needed to work on, both, my iPhone (repair) and MacBook Pro (upgrade RAM and install SSD) correctly without a single problem."
5.0,Great tablet for the price
5.0,"This case is extremely attractive, compact and completely protects my Kindle Paperwhite (which I have frequently dropped or knocked onto the floor). The magnetic closure ensures that my device is turned off when not in use.  I also have the larger 8&#34; Kindle HD in a leather case, but this case is better by far."
5.0,Is exactly what I wanted.
5.0,Received quickly and works great!
5.0,I use them for my motorcycle and there great

5.0,Love it - can't put it down - so user-friendly
5.0,"Works as expected, benzel arrived broken seller imediately sent replacement."
5.0,This is a very good wireless mouse that replaced my other Logitech wireless mouse after about 5 years of use. Even though this one doesn't have a laser sensor it still works great on almost any surface. Would recommend.
5.0,Use these everyday had to buy them because my hdmi went out on my computer had to use the other cord. You cant get sound using the old way of hooking your pc. Well that's the reason for the speakers.
5.0,Very nice at a good price!
5.0,very good
5.0,Fits Amazing! I got the yellow one and was afraid it would be too bright and neon but it wasn't! It was just the right amount of bright. :) I would say it is more of a yellow ochre. I put it next to my old red macbook so that you can compare the yellow. Hope that helps.
5.0,"MikroTik is a serious contender for replacing Cisco 1900, 2900 and 3900 series routers and even newer series Cisco routers.<br /><br />In head-to-head comparisons with a Cisco 2901, the MikroTik CCR sustains much higher packets-per-second and overall throughput with less CPU utilization.  While Cisco enterprise feature set can do more than MikroTik, if you're using Cisco IP base license and even the security license, you should find just about anything you need in a MikroTik CCR.  It will take some time to get used to but you'll be rewarded.  The only drawback in this platform is WAN connectivity.  There is no option to put modems, T1 cards, etc. in the MikroTik.  It is Ethernet only but they don't purposely throttle the performance like Cisco has done for many years.  If you can get T1 delivered in Ethernet via Adtran or similar, use MetroEthernet and Internet connections, you're in a great position to have achieve really great performance at a lower price than Cisco.  I've been using Cisco since the 90's and use them in small, medium and large deployments but sometimes you just need something with higher performance at a great price.  MikroTik has been the best solution.  We have large deployments in networks with over 30 MikroTik routers from the smallest to the CCR and we've been extremely satisfied."
5.0,"I was a little bit sketchy about purchasing a tablet online without trying it out first, at a store. I did purchases at a discounted price, I still spent quite a bit of money because I purchased two of these. I purchased the pink one for my daughter and the blue one for my son as a Christmas gift, trying to get an early start.  When I received these and opened them up I was very happy with the way they look visually. The colors are much more vibrant in person than they are in the picture, it really doesn't do it justice. The pink is very bright and the blue is very eye-catching.  I love the size of these because my kids can watch movies online and hold these in their lap easily without dropping them. They are not heavy, very lightweight. I have powered these off and on and played around with them with no problem. They connected to the Internet easily and it was also easy to access all the tools within this tablet. I love that you could put them in a bag and carry them with ease, for me it's good entertainment for my kids when I'm busy trying to do other things.  The screen is nice and easy to clean, you can see the graphics very easily and the settings are easy to change.  So far so good and I'm happy with my purchases my only concern is the durability  of these tablets especially being used by kids only time will tell.<br /><br />I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback"
5.0,I wouldn't order this item again
5.0,Best SSD out there for the price!!
5.0,"Clean design, works great as expected"
5.0,Proper fit.  It just works...
5.0,"I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with this tablet. Handles all apps I throw at it, and the screen looks great. I primarily use it for simple games, surfing and reading. With moderate use, the battery lasts a few days before I have to charge it. The aluminum back plate also gives the tablet a very sturdy feel. Good luck finding all that elsewhere with a 10&#34; screen for under $140."
5.0,Awesome. On time
5.0,"works like a charm.  easy to use, picks up sound great."
5.0,A coffee shop must
5.0,It works!

5.0,"Incredibly useful device: it turns an iPad into a laptop, seamlessly.  I have probably got Logitech more sales by simply demonstrating how good it is to acquaintances, than they have by advertising it - because I've NEVER seen an advert!"
5.0,WORKED VERY WELL
5.0,We are a medical clinic that depends on it's rechargeable batteries and these are used for communication devices between our Urgent Care Department and other departments to see if patients can be seen in other parts of the clinic as well as for many other things.<br />They have done so well for us that I was asked to buy more for back up for other department devises.<br />Also they arrived quite fast after I placed the order.
5.0,Product as described.  Fast Shipping
5.0,Love it!
5.0,Love this drive. It's fast and easy to set up. I just plugged it into my Windows 8 PC and ran the setup utility. I decided not to use the encryption feature so I could plug this unit into my NAS for more shared space.
5.0,"The speakers are remarkably good for the price.  Now, they are not up to the standards of a $100 pair of speakers, but for ordinary computer use, they are more than fine.  I am not really a fan of LED lights, but the ones on the base of the speakers do look quite nice."
5.0,"I used 2 USB to serial cables connecting to this device, it works perfectly for me. A good product!"
5.0,This is the perfect cover for my daughter's laptop! She is very happy with the design and usability and pocket placement. I was a little surprised the product's colors are darker than I expected (It seems more light gray and gray than white and gray) but my daughter expressed that it was just what she expected.
5.0,"Solid construction, and more room than what is readily apparent at first look.  I had overstuffed my previous backpack of the same size.  I had my doubts about whether I could fit everything into the new backpack.  Yet when I transferred everything over to the Victoriatourist, it still looked like it was half empty! Also, the straps and back panel were truly designed for comfort.  Definitely a wise purchase."
5.0,Great Price and it works 100%
5.0,Don't drop it! I dropped mine within a couple days of getting it and it is ruined.
5.0,Replaced same mb that only lasted one year. Lets see how long this one lasts
5.0,Bought for daughter...Works great!
5.0,So far so good work right away charges great only time will tell how is it long it last of course these reviews should be done yearly.... little worried about the price but it doesn't get hot which is what I thought would happen
5.0,"Massive capacity. Haven't did any testing but it transferred 500 gigs ov movies 350 gigs of steam games and 150 gigs of music while I went to dinner at a local restaurant. Came back a few hours later and my rig was finished With the transfer. Build quality seems okay. But like all others if a connector fails, the hard drive inside can usually fit in another home."
5.0,"Good idea! Thankfully I haven't had to use it yet. I had some trouble setting it up. Their website had a glitch in it. However I was able to call, and one of their representatives was able to set it up for me."
5.0,Love haven't tried it yet
5.0,"The adaptor worked fine out of the box.  I have run it with a couple of different monitors and video projectors, no complaint."
5.0,"It worked out perfectly! I'm glad I ended up getting this, well worth the value. I bought a used one and saved a little. Beats having your internet company charge you for renting theirs for around $10/month."
5.0,"Worked perfectly. I only buy RAM from Crucial. I am willing to pay a little more for Crucial because they get it right. Returning RAM is a hassle with other companies, so why bother. Seems to be working fine."
5.0,Works perfectly with by pc.
5.0,This was the perfect replacement for my screen.
5.0,Good price

5.0,"Excelent product, excelent price"
5.0,"This device is smaller than the 16GB I had before it (and it's 32GB)! It is light weight, and fits on my keychain perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised with this product."
5.0,It works as expected...what else do I need to say?
5.0,works perfectly.
5.0,"This is a great high quality keyboard. The switches feel very light and fluid with a slight tactile feedback, but I can also rest my hands on the keys themselves without depressing them. The key tops are shaped differently from probably any other keyboard, and the edges take some getting used to. As other users have said, the key tops make the key spacing feel slightly different, but the spacing is actually about the same (if not exactly the same) as is standard for Logitech. The key laser etching looks fantastic, and the lighting for each key is confined only to that key with a very uniform brightness.<br /><br />The keyboard feels nice and weighty - not necessarily heavy, but it feels like it is durable. The quality of plastic used feels very high quality, not like the standard plastic you find in most keyboards. As stated, it comes with two palm rests. The one typically pictured is good for gaming, but it forces your hands into a slightly asymmetric position, unsuitable for typing. The second, smaller palm rest is the one I keep on the keyboard. It is wide enough for a guy with fairly large hands. It is also what you would want to use for typing, as it keeps your hands positioned more symmetrically.<br /><br />Overall, I am highly pleased with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a high end mechanical keyboard. It may be pricey, but it is very worth it."
5.0,Haven't really used it
5.0,This is so far to good honest I can't can't complain I'm loving it.
5.0,One of the best buys of the month.
5.0,Works as expected without any issues.  The web interface is pretty easy to use for VLAN configuration and other basic configuration.
5.0,Perfect case for me. Love it.

The triangular vents, combined with the thin, angular shape, gives it a somewhat futuristic geometric look that's a lot better than some of the other antenna-like ones I've seen.<br /><br />Performance:<br />I get download speeds of 70-90 Mbps  on the 5 GHz band, as opposed to the unusably slow 1-7 Mbps I was getting on the 2.4 GGz.<br /><br />I bought this for my aging laptop, which did not support newer standards. The difference in speeds was well worth the price.<br /><br />Drivers: Get them directly from the Netgear site. I'm on Windows 10, and they had drivers that supported Windows 10 on the site."
5.0,Happy with it.
5.0,"Do you work in an office setting? At a computer for more than 45 minutes? Do you enjoy your wrists and the comfort to not feel pain when you bend your wrists?<br />If you said yes, then this is for you! Fits amazingly. Love this mouse."
5.0,works great! perfect reception. simply plug and work on Win 10 without any installations.
5.0,"I have never purchased such a well bought case. I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13.3&#34;, and it fit perfectly! Currently, I travel a lot and it has proven it's durability -- The cover's color is accurate to the picture online and doesn't accumulate dirt or oil finger prints. It is easy to snap on and remove.  This exceeded my expectations.  Will be recommending them to many of my friends."

5.0,"Incredible storage for a phone, camera etc that take SD cards mini hard drive"
5.0,"Perfect size for my 2 year old and now I don't have to worry so much when she plays (she used to use my HDX, which is a lot more expensive).  Perfect for little hands and I got it $30 off last week during a flash sale.  Great deal.  Although I have to contact customer service as they always come with 1-year warranties and it asked me if I wasnted a 1-year warranty at checkout... so if it doesn't include a warranty, I wll knock 2-3 stars off immediately and update the review.  That wuld be a sad thing for them to have done.<br /><br />I'm glad to see the charger back included, but if the cost is losing the warranty- not worth it since any micro USB charger works and I have had about a dozen kindles and already have the chargers.  Warranty is much more important for a kids' machine."
5.0,"I just received this device and put it through its paces. So far it's excellent! It is essentially the same shape as the Logitech MX 510 and Performance MX mice that I have used for years in a slightly smaller form factor. Even so, it fits my paw of a hand very comfortably. But the smaller size makes it easily stowed in a laptop bag. It uses one AA battery and a USB nano receiver which stores neatly and securely in the battery compartment when traveling. There is power button on the bottom for battery conservation when not in use. The scroll wheel is clicky, which I prefer, and there are side buttons for backward and forward paging in browsers.The sensitivity seems perfect to me but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Installation was trivial. Insert the battery, power on the mouse, insert the receiver,  and the drivers install automatically (Windows 10). It did not install any bloatware or additional crapware that must be manually disabled or uninstalled, as Logitech loves to do. Very clean and minimalistic.<br /><br />Time will tell if it stands up to moderate use or there are other warts. I worry that the battery cover compartment may be flimsy for repeated open/close to remove/store the receiver. However, so far this is flawless and the price is unbeatable. Exactly what I wanted. Recommended!"

5.0,"Experience Level - High Consumer; been using routers since there have been routers.  Previous brands used: Buffalo - still the overall best for experimenters and tinkers when running DD-WRT (still have and use a closet full).<br /><br />OK, I haven't bought a new router in a while (several years).  Usually I buy Buffalo, but decided to try something different this time for the heck of it.  I did some reading and came across the TP-Link brand.  To be honest, this was the first I'd ever heard of it.  I haven't kept up with all the new ratings like AC1250, AC1900 and up.  I use routers to connect stuff to the internet (65Mb dl speed), not move vast amounts of files from one user to another in house, so pretty much any router can do what I need.<br /><br />The AC2600 and 3200 routers looked cool, but the prices didn't.  This TP 1900 was actually a little more than I wanted to spend, but some reading on this beam forming stuff now out there piqued my interest.  So, give it a shot.<br /><br />Set up was easy.  There's a fairly decent instruction sheet for those that want it (a violation of my Ham Radio Code of Operation to refer to instruction sheets).  It would be pretty tough to physically set this router up wrong.  It stands on something of your choice and apparently does not have a way to wall hang (unless you make one).<br /><br />Config using the built in app was easy.  As with nearly all routers there are pages and pages of really cool looking things to modify and change.  Unless you are really a power user, leave those alone.  Messing with those for most of us is like teaching a pig to sing - it doesn't accomplish much and annoys the pig.  One thing I did go into in the extended setting to do was set up port forwarding for control software of my home security system.  Piece of cake, but probably not something most users would ever do.<br /><br />CHANGE THE DEFAULT USER, PASSWORD AND SSID.  If you do nothing else, do this.<br /><br />I've had this going for a week or so now.  It perks right along, delivering the full speed of my cable internet (65m) over the entire house.  My previous router (an older Buff) had some weak spots.  This one is full scale on my entire property, inside and out (a lot about 100'x50'.<br /><br />Bottom line:  PRO's - works well, easy to set up and does exactly what I want a router to do.  CON: A little more expensive that I would have liked, but still way below the big 2600 and 3200 routers.or so now.

5.0,nice
5.0,So lovely! prettier then pictured! Thank you!
5.0,"The best thing i love to do with my Windows 8.1 tablet that I got as a free trial is watch movies on it. I can watch 3 movies, almost 4 before the battery runs dry. The memory card can hold many movies or music, or even thousands of pictures. I love having lots of options on my tablets."
5.0,This works perfectly! It is easy to set up and provides all of the connectivity of any router out there. I wish it was available in 5.0 gHz but maybe for HooToo Two.
5.0,Amazing connection speeds. Works great with Linux distro's Pentoo and ADHD for Pent-testing. Did not have driver support for Kali Linux as of this review.
5.0,"For most people, this is the best laptop you can get in this price range. Most people only need a laptop for browsing the internet, and a Chromebook is perfect for that. Although you won't be able to use Windows apps or play much games, what you get in return in a fast, sleek, lightweight laptop perfect for almost everyone. If you want a laptop that is under 500 dollars, I highly recommend the Chromebook."
5.0,Great Hard Drive for reasonable price!
5.0,"If your looking for a 7&#34; tablet - not a laptop replacement this little guy is great for the price. Fits in the palm of your hand, has a standard USB port, supports a wireless display adapter if you want to put it on a larger screen (and have a mircast device) and does a tiny bit more than you'd expect from something so small with such limited storage space. For what I needed, a small form factor x86 compatible device with USB ports, it works great."
5.0,"Ordered easily, shipped 2 days later and received when expected.  Works great. We have been using for a month does not overheat like some replacement chargers."
5.0,This works perfect for carrying my MacBook Air and my iPad Air to meetings!
5.0,Travel companion!!! Keeps all my cables in order! Lovei t! Also fits my portable hard drive and abck up battery.
5.0,Works real well in my computer however I wished my hdmi port didn't go out on my pc.
5.0,This is my favorite hard drive to upgrade laptops to! It's standard laptop drive. works great in non retina macs and it definitely provides a speed boost. It has a solid 8gb of SSD for the OS and common used apps.
5.0,great product
5.0,"This NetSocket model exhibits much the same behavior as its NetPlug brother -- smooth, consistent connection with no hiccups. Hardly any additional latency on most installations. Moderate jitter increase at the very most, but as with all powerline units, that is to be expected.  These units tend to be a tad bit slower than some of the more performance-focused models from Netgear, TP-Link, D-Link and the like, but I think the slight speed hit is well worth it. For whatever reason, when most of those brands/models have failed to connect due to old/shoddy wiring, weird breaker configurations, longer distances, etc. these just seem to connect, stay connected and &#34;just work&#34;.  I'll definitely be using more LEAs on jobs where the higher-speed alternatives just won't behave. And I'm definitely keeping an eye out for their NetSocket 1800 when it releases in the US, hopefully some time soon."
5.0,"I'm very very happy with this laptop, but I have a problem with Windows 10 in any times show a Error and restart automatically."
5.0,I have had this for some time now well over a month and it works perfectly great! Glad I bought.
5.0,"I bought this in February 2015 (it's now 8/31) and have been using it pretty hard for 6 months - swapping it between my laptop & mini laptop.  The product is very sturdy and all around excellent. no problems whatsoever. it still fits tightly into the slot, and the speed and response that I get with this product are MUCH better than some of the cheaper products I'd purchased in the past.  This is a great value item.  the others I'd bought didn't last a month without breaking in some fashion - but this is still like new."
5.0,"This computer is fantastic. It's fast, light and great to work on. I love the keyboard and how it feels when you type. The screen is the high quality touch screen. I'm honestly not too sure why it's a touch screen since the monitor does not flip completely around and fold like a tablet. You simply need to touch the screen when it's in the normal laptop form, weird but I guess some people might do that.<br /><br />Overall the laptop works great for what I'm using it for: Work. When I travel and sit in conferences for hours on end, it make my life easy by being light and easy to move while also having a killer battery life. It lasts for hours and can quickly recharge during short 30-60 min breaks.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this laptop for the traveling business professional in search of portability and battery life."
5.0,Works great
5.0,This iPad arrived and was in good condition.
5.0,"Wonderful case. Probably the nicest case I've ever owned (i've owned a lot of cases).<br /><br />Well designed, well hinged, lots of space inside."
5.0,"Works great. I don't see any issue, and it works well as expected"
5.0,"Great router, very easy to install, great range, reliable and most importantly easy to use...<br />Highly recommended, great deal at this price point. Very satisfied with my purchase..."
5.0,I was able to get this item at a discount for an exchange of my unbiased review. I'm no expert in gaming but my brothers are. I gave it to them to test it out for me. They love it. They can stream and record their plays and watch it over or post on social media. The resolution is fantastic. They also can add audio like music or their own recordings and even what everyone says as they are playing the multiplayer games. It is light weight and connects to their PC and laptop with ease. They see me as the coolest sister!
5.0,Best thing since sliced bread! I have deformed fingers from arthritis so holding that tiny S Pen was difficult as well as using my fingers on the screen. This stylus is worth every penny of the cost. Especially since it functions in every way like an S Pen. It had a side button that performs the exact same tasks on my phone. A true lifesaver for me.
5.0,Exactly as described and my drive fits perfectly.  Easy to install.
5.0,works just as decription says
5.0,"I’ve used many cooling trays in the past, but never found one quite like this. It operates the same way that many other cooling trays do. You flip out the feet so that your laptop is sitting at an angle and plug in the USB cord into your laptop. This is how the tray gets powered. On another note, you can also plug your tray into an external USB battery if your laptop is low on power. When you plug in the tray, its fans come on and so does its LED light! This is a very fun, colorful addition to the traditional cooing stand for laptops.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

5.0,It has worked out to be a great purchase.
5.0,Works like advertised!
5.0,My daughter loves this case and it seems to do a great job protecting her laptop.
5.0,So far I definitely recommend.
5.0,"Bought this after verifying with Plantronics that this dongle will work with Voyager Legend  (primarily for Lync usage), This can save you $$ because the one listed for Voyager Legend specified dongle cost you over 50$  Works good for ~30 feet range (blue tooth standards).  If the dongle is powered on by the computer before switching ON the blue tooth head-set,  it requires removing the dongle and inserting it again for pairing.<br /><br />BTW...Plantronics Voyager Legend blue tooth device is the best suited for BT device for long hours of use at work place."
5.0,"Great cloud setup.  Easy to use with Iphone, ipad or any other device."
5.0,Lightning fast! Super easy install in LenovoU410. Battery lasts longer. Computer runs cooler.

5.0,Love it
5.0,"I have two of these now, one for each laptop"
5.0,"Works great. I've had this on my Macbook Pro (2.7Ghz) for OVER two years now. It spent a year protecting my Mac on 3 moves, including getting my music degree in Spain. Took it around Europe for 3 weeks and I fly with it everywhere. Now if you're the type that typically breaks things, good luck. This will not protect against stupidity. But treat it like it's a $20 piece of plastic and it will go the extra mile for you. I would definitely buy this again for any future Macbooks."
5.0,Very handy and exactly as described.
5.0,Perfect!
5.0,its a cable and works as it should.
5.0,Product was as described and perfect. The backpack was delivered as promised. I have no issues with the product or the seller.
5.0,Great brush!!! It really helps when trying to brush kids hair!
5.0,"Love it, it protects the screen and I love the pink"
5.0,"Monitor: Very clear, very detail and vivid colors, it works great. Finally a good 2560 x 1440 monitor at an affordable price. The outside diagonal size from corner to corner (outside) it's 26&#34;. My old 24&#34; monitor was 25 3/4&#34;, it doesn't take more room.<br />Speakers: not good at all, do no base buying this monitor on the quality of the built in speakers."
5.0,"Fortunately, the case is perfect for my needs. It’s well made with solid material and lightweight enough. Couldn’t be happier."
5.0,Works great!
5.0,This is a very nice little case. I was surprised at how pretty it is! The pictures don't do it justice. It looks like leather and holds the Paperwhite securely.
5.0,"The decal came with directions, but I didn't understand them until I went on YouTube to figure out how to apply it so I suppose it takes some skill to apply it correctly, but it wasn't too difficult. The design has a matte finish and looks great.<br />I choose to put this on my 11'' Chromebook and it fit perfectly so I'm really pleased with this product."
5.0,"This one works great, overall quality and appearance seem to be very good. I have a dual-SSD system with Win 7 Pro x64* and Linux Mint 17.2, running FSX at top settings in Win 7 and plan to do X-Plane in Linux (for those concerned - sure I use a separate graphic card, c'mon guys). MB appears to be a solid part of that. Experienced no problems at all so far.<br />*yes, Win 7 in 2015 is on purpose, there is a number of reasons for that"

5.0,great product
5.0,So nice to have my older Mac desktop humming again. No problems at all with the product.
5.0,I have this card in my home theater PC and it performs very well. Even in today's standards. Although you have to have a dms-59 adapter you will not suffer any image quality loss for movies n stuff. I currently use a DMS-59 to DVI adapter that has an HDMI on the other end for my TV. No image quality loss whatsoever.

5.0,Excelente...
5.0,"This is an excellent case, well designed and reasonably priced.  I love it!! I thought that the blue was coming off of the clasp, but it was just a coating to protect it in transit.  It is a very nice looking case. Note that you can put nothing other than your kindle voyage in this case."
5.0,"Very nice, lightweight case. Did not want a heavy case after buying the nice, lightweight Air 2 iPad. Like that it turns off the iPad just by closing the case. Also stands up nicely. Did think it on the pricey side, though."
5.0,Works fine.  Good response from Amazon also due to faulty port on my computer.  5*
5.0,"Surprisingly pleased with this wireless mouse.  Works great and have not had any complaints.  I'm kind of clumsy so it has been dropped several times, kicked a few, etc, and is still holding up well.  The batteries that were included from Amazon have actually lasted longer than I expected they would as well.  Would buy again if needed, but its still working great."
5.0,It is very good. Shipping is on time. The price is OK. Thank you very much. Have a good business to you!

5.0,"This processor works like a charm. I had some issues in the beginning when I applied the thermal compound, but after cleaning it off with rubbing alcohol, I reapplied it and assembled my PC. I turned on my PC, and it works fast for an APU.<br /><br />I would recommend this processor for those who want to build a budget gaming PC without breaking the bank.That's kinda what I did. Just make sure to get the right motherboard and the right RAM cards for that motherboard by checking the motherboard's Memory QVL list.<br />I had to learn that the hard way."

5.0,Great headset
5.0,"This case is very sturdy. Took a little while to get the iPad into because it seemed not to fit. But after a few minutes of just resting in there it popped into place. Now it's snug! My other case I had like this the iPad was always slipping out of the groves on the bottom when I had it standing. Now it doesn't slip! Could be just because it is new, but as of right now it's perfect. Colors are vibrant and has a good texture to it."
5.0,picked up a second one to keep at home so I don't have to keep pulling my main out of my laptop bag.  Thank you PWR+ for making such great products.
5.0,"was so confused when first received almost sent back, but persevered - bought a book - got help from a great friend - and now i absolutely love it -<br />it's as good as an iphone or ipad (pretty much - at ledt for me - get email, all kinds of apps - most free - google chrome or explorer - couldn't be happier - love my samsung tablet - I'M AN OLD GAL - VERY INTO COMPUTER BUT WAS AFRAID OF  anything more complex - but it's less<br />complex than the compuer  and lots more fun!"

5.0,"// , The patcher, the white thing shown in the picture, works REALLY well to keep this from tangling as much when stored.<br /><br />Very thoughtful."

5.0,"Works as intended. I had a small hard drive from a laptop, instead of buying another hard drive decided to buy this and it fits in the PC case very easily. Holds it nice and snug. Shipping was fast."
5.0,Great Drive. Purchased this drive a little over a year ago and is still running with no problems.
5.0,"Great product, read my full review here - http://blog.alexburn.co.uk/tech-reviews/synology-ds414-full-review/"
5.0,"This thing is awesome.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  The only issue that I've had with it is that it doesn't work perfectly with all graphics programs.  Works beautifully with photoshop, and really, every Adobe software that I've paired it with.  It didn't work so well with the standard Fresh Paint default software that comes with Windows 8.  It didn't matter how much I adjusted the sensitivity setting, it just didn't work well."
5.0,Perfect size for my digital camera.  I try to take lots of pictures of my 3 little ones.  This is a great card to hold them on.  I own several of these cards and love them.  Have not had any problems with this brand in the last 10 years.
5.0,I was very pleased with the amFilm Screen Protector. It was easy for me to apply. Would buy again when needed.
5.0,"Exactly as advertised, quick delivery.  What more can you ask for?"
5.0,"This is a nice, solid easy to use keyboard/case.  I like the flexibility of being able to easily remove the keyboard from the case and use the case any way or position I need to.  It was very easy to pair and start using, comes with a recharging cord. I bought it for my wife and she's very pleased and loves the color."
5.0,Just as expected.

5.0,works great
5.0,"I have a 7 year old Dell Studio XPS 435 MT which has been a great computer.  After the power to my house went off unexpectedly for a few minutes, I could not get my computer to turn back on.  The green light on the power supply unit and the orange light on my motherboard would come on, but I could not get it to power up.  After doing some research online, I decided my best course of action would be to replace the PSU and found this one on Amazon at a very good price and with very good reviews.  Removing the old PSU was easy and straight forward and installing the new one was just as easy.  I crossed my fingers, pressed the power button and the computer powered right up.  The quality of the new PSU seems very good.  Add to that the ease of installation and how quiet it is, it easily earns 5 stars from me."
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,Excellent package at a great price.
5.0,"Purchased my first iPad & ordered several different cases from Amazon to decide on the one I preferred best.  I was interested in this case, but after reading the reviews was concerned it might be a little too thick & clunky.  As a result, I ordered a thin smart cover case (Khomo Dual Super Slim) and another rotating case (Fintie) that looked very similar but for considerably less money.<br />My observations:<br />Khomo Dual Slim Case -- for me this was just to thin & did not provide the added protection of the Targus or Fintie. It was a Smart Cover & did put the iPad Air to sleep. If you don't want any bulk & no features except putting your case to sleep, this may work well for you. It has over 10,000 reviews & is well rated, but it's not for me.<br /><br />Fintie 360 Rotating Case -- looks very similar from the outside but clearly did not feel or behave like the Targus rotating case. It felt a bit less heavy and the grooves that allow the tablet to sit in landscape mode were not as deep, not as many grooves, & did not feel as stable in the groove when compared to the Targus. In portrait position, both the Targus & the Fintie are less secure in position when compared to landscape mode. The Fintie  tablet seemed a bit more wobbly in Portrait position than the Targus.  I use Portrait mode mainly for Face-Time.<br /><br />Targus case -- I have used this case for 6 weeks now & am certain I made the best decision for my needs!<br />Sleep mode does not hesitate when you close the cover. I appreciate the elastic band that keeps the case closed. I use a stylus touch pen that has a clip & leash (Friendly Swede available on Amazon) & I clip the pen to the band instead of using the provided sleeve because it's quicker & easier.  I could take or leave the business card holder. I probably would prefer if this feature was omitted and one more groove added.  Since it's there, I find that a business card tends to bend when you try to insert one. My work around is to insert an oldplastic (like credit card) gift card and then put in a couple of business cards on top. It slides easier. I can also insert a small microfiber cloth in- between these cards so it's there when needed.  No difficulty in rotating, although I do steady the tablet when in Portrait mode.  The stitching seems well done, no loose threads noted inside or out.  The corners seem well protected & it's easy to access the volume & power switches as well as charging port.<br />I primarily use Landscape mode & LOVE the fact that the tablet will stay in this position securely while I tap on the keyboard or use gestures on the touch screen. It is rock steady.  For my purposes, it is neither too thick, heavy, or cumbersome.  I appreciate the extra protection for this expensive device!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this case & would certainly look to Targus for any future cases I may need to purchase."
5.0,Works as advertised.
5.0,Love the mouse.
5.0,Fast shipping and well-packaged.  Took about 10-15 minutes to replace the original screen which cracked.  Looks good as new and is an easy fix - you can do it!
5.0,Works great with AT&T Uverse service.
5.0,Excellent Speed for what I needed.
5.0,Great for my small lipstick chargers for my iPhone to keep in my pocketbook
5.0,Using with Mac Mini and Apple MC184LL/B Wireless Keyboard.
5.0,Fit's good and will keep my screen protected.
5.0,"As others have mentioned, Very quiet, and enough cooling power to cool off my receiver and other components in my entertainment center. If anyone wants an automatic on/off control just plug the power cord into the switched outlet in back of your receiver and they will fire up as soon as you turn on your receiver!!"
5.0,This is working well for me as a cheap and easy to operate keyboard/mouse combo for a home theater PC.
5.0,My charger for my laptop is working wonderful.
5.0,"So far...so good. This little USB wireless adapter has been running without hiccup for a couple weeks now. It picks up our router quite easily from approx. 75 feet away and through 4 walls made of your standard wood framing, insulation, and drywall.<br />At first after we set it up, which was very easy in Windows 7, we only got about 20mbps download speed from our verizon fios quantum router running at 75/75 wireless N speeds, but a quick move of the TP-LINK on the desk from one spot to another and we hit 45mbps on the speedtest. Not bad given the distance and amount of obstructions this wireless adapter was to deal with and the fact that it connects at 2.4Ghz.<br />The price is amazing!!"
5.0,Was shipped quickly and worked right out of the box. A very nice product and also a very good deal for the price . My son is very happy with this computer ...
5.0,Did the job!
5.0,easy to install works great.
5.0,A lot of data storage and quality product.
5.0,Fantastic case with plenty of room for cable management and a large motherboard.  Fans run quietly and the CAM program which monitors the CPU & GPU is a nice touch.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0,Perfect fit for my Ipad 1st generation.
5.0,"My husband loves this case! He is very hard on electonics and had no case for his iPad. This was a father's day gift and a great buy for the price. So far he has had no problems and takes it everywhere, perfect fit for his 2nd generation iPad."
5.0,my favorite
5.0,Very Pleased
5.0,"Loved it, the price was great and it resolved an issue I was having with the downloads on my phone."
5.0,the sounds very well
5.0,This case is such good quality.  The stitching is perfect.  I had to replace a case I bought from the Apple store as it fell apart.<br />This one is much better.  I  bought the bright green so I could find it easily around my house. It is well worth the money.  I  Like the holder<br />for my stylus.  I was surprised how well made it is.  Would highly recommend.
5.0,Love my gadgets thank you
5.0,So far so good ! I think it lasts longer than the original battery.
5.0,"Purchased or recommended so many of these drives. Super fast, reliable and great warranty."
5.0,Received very quickly. Easy to setup snd install. Perfect!
5.0,This is a GREAT case.  Beautiful color blue and much thicker than we imagined.  Super protective!  Very pleased with this choice after looking at many others.  HIGHLY recommend!
5.0,"Love this thing, keeps dirt/food out of my keyboard and my color (the rainbow) allows the backlight to shine through."
5.0,"I'm extremely impressed with this product. After a year and a half of bending the keyboard back to use the iPad as a sketch tool, then bending it forward again to post my drawings to social media, the case has performed excellently. The hing creaks very deliberately, affirming a good tight fit. the most impressive attribute is the keys on the keyboard. The keyboard hasn't been treated delicately, and though it's folded back and subject to being dragged along a variety of surfaces, none of the keys show any wear and tear. None at all. they're not even loose- which is amazing when considering how I abuse the thing. they still spring back to emulate an actual keyboard. I've not experienced the hing cracking that others have. the iPad sits snugly into the top part of the case. very very happy with the product."
5.0,What can I say. It works very well and the price is less. What more can I ask for in a great product.
5.0,fast shipping will do more business
5.0,Use this charger everyday. Love it.  I need to look for a longer one.
5.0,Arrived promptly and described.
5.0,my daughter loves this lapdesk works  great for her college late night homework
5.0,"The size is best for a 10.1&#34; tablet.  Smaller items will seem like they have been swallowed up.  I bought 3 for my Windows tablets.  The bag cushions the tablets adequately when they are stacked together, which is why I wanted them.  Pull tabs seem nice and sturdy.  Handles feel good, but not obviously double-reinforced.  I'll see if I can give an update after a year.  The pouch will accommodate an 8 1/2 x 11&#34; paper folded in half and should take most accessories, which is the other main reason I selected this bag.  Strap loops would be nice, but remember you are only paying $10 for a great bag!"
5.0,"FINALLY! I used to have a 5 button mouse back in the early 00's, and loved it. Since then most gaming mice have come with a bunch of extra features, a 6th button or extra macro buttons, and missed the mark, as far as I care.<br /><br />This mouse is perfect. It is a 5 button mouse with a DPI switch just below the scroll.  The buttons are all easily reachable, and there are no extra macro buttons. The coloration of the mouse lights look really great, and it responds really well. The side buttons are click buttons, not plastic domes. The middle mouse does not have a left/right scroll function, which was annoying me about other mice that I have been using in this class.<br /><br />A feature that's not really displayed very well here is on the underside, there are some small glide feet right around the sensor that help keep junk away from the lens, which is pretty nice in a house with shedding pets.<br /><br />This mouse is KISS through and through, and has great style with it. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great mouse, not just for gaming!"
5.0,"buy them.  Cheaper than the original, 6ft long, and fit with my life proof case on which is huge.  Life span on cables sucks in general, but these seem to be on par with anything else I've used in the past"
5.0,Did not work for what I needed but not the parts fault.
5.0,It does its job of protecting the iPad. I bought it as a gift and it is great. It stands and all that stuff. It is great quality. She likes the color and the gift of an iPad
5.0,"Easy to install, works perfectly."
5.0,Work Great fair price. Thanks.
5.0,Cheap and it works great what else can you ask for
5.0,The first battery lasted 2 days...BUT...it was a cheap knock off battery and the item arrived in the &#34;on&#34; position so who knows how long it really lasted. Installed a quality battery and the item is fantastic. Love it.
5.0,Fantastic
5.0,"Don't go by the bad reviews at this price this thing is great no install just plug in the USB receiver and works on any OS (or I can say Windows 10 and 7, Linux and Ubuntu)! Great price, works great, looks great, arrived extremely fast in retail packaging that was perfect also!"
5.0,works perfect
5.0,"Looks like  do not have a screen protector, great product. Pretty easy to apply as well."
5.0,"I really like this bag. Unfortunately, it's just a tad too small to comfortably fit a 13.3&#34; laptop. I bought it because it was small, and i wanted it for carrying a notepad, a book, and a tablet.... For which it is excellent. Nice amount of pockets, good quality, love the color/material. Then i find out i need to bring my laptop to work for a while, and was crossing my fingers. I can squeeze it in the main compartment but it contorts the bag a bit on the sides if i do. It totally doesn't fit in the padded tablet section though (which it isn't meant to, being a tablet bag).<br /><br />If i got an 11.6 inch laptop I think it would have fit perfectly. Liked the bag so much i considered getting a different laptop to fit, but couldn't sacrifice the specs to do so.<br /><br />Im looking forward to the day when i no longer need to bring my laptop to work so i can go back to using this bag, instead of my bigger laptop bag."
5.0,Works as it should!<br />Will buy again.
5.0,"Nice speakers, have had them for a few weeks so it's hard to comment on the long-term quality, but I read many good things on Creative. I was concerned about the Bluetooth operation as several mentioned some background sounds, but mine work fine, no noise. (Sometimes I wonder if people follow basic instructions). Good quality sound., great for the price."
5.0,Works great. It fits perfect and looks really nice. Glad I choose this one.
5.0,I bought this charger and it is a great replacement for the original. I recommend this product.
5.0,Changed my life. It is so good.
5.0,It works excellent on any windows version...
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Had a problem getting Netflix with my previous router. Partially do to it's location.<br />Works just fine, fixed the problem. Good value/"
5.0,WORKS FINE AND HAS BEEN USER INTERFACE FRIENDLY SO FAR.
5.0,Bought this for a friend he loves it no complainants five stars
5.0,Just what I need for my cell phone.
5.0,"There are a ton of cases out there for iPad's. It all comes down to preference. But after looking through lots of different options, we got these. These have been great! We run all of our media at church form iPad's and these allow our tech crew to stand them up and easily control the three we use. Plus the cases are very protective with is another major factor we look for."
5.0,Great
5.0,"Beautiful color, fits perfectly, fast delivery.  I would recommend purchasing if this color speaks to your heart."
5.0,"Love the color and so far so good.  We haven't dropped the device to see how it works in that sense, and don't really want to test that out :)  When you put it on, it doesn't &#34;feel&#34; like it's on correctly, but it's definitely in place.  Magnets work good, so &#34;sleeps&#34; when covered and &#34;wakes&#34; as soon as you open it.  Folds into a nice stand too.  Overall, we are pleased."
5.0,Great computer for the price the only down side is the battery life but 5-6 hours is okay
5.0,Great unit
5.0,"100% recommendable, this wireless controller is the same as an orginal wireless controller"
5.0,great card
5.0,Easy to set up.  I have it sitting in the window at my parents house which is about one hundred fifty feet away.  This router repeats my signal in my parents house without a problem.
5.0,Exactly what I was expecting!
5.0,Awesome Screen
5.0,Works great
5.0,This SD card is great. I have been using this memory for almost 2 years. I already have 6 of them and none of them have never failed.<br /><br />Good speed for videos or stills. I´m using this memories on my Canon 70D.
5.0,"This iDeaUSA tablet cover is ideal for a 7 inch tablet. It is made of high quality leather. It is beautiful and has a sleek design. I got it as a sample a month ago, and I can say it's very durable. It does a great job protecting my tablet from dust, scratches, and any type of damage. The cover is water resistant, so it's an overall protection. A perfect case."
5.0,Works perfect. Plug and play.
5.0,"Apart from waiting forever for the shipment from China, product works as described."
5.0,GREAT PURCHASE-FITS AND LOOKS GREAT ON MY MAC!!!!
5.0,"Good for people who aren't blessed with front 3.0 ports, after I connected and mounted them to the front of my PC, I tested them. From my results, there is no noteworthy difference in speed from using a extension or the port alone."
5.0,perfect fit
5.0,Works as suppose to.
5.0,"Amazing quality and power. Have Asus tablet for a few years and use 6 hrs day, so the Asus bar was set high. Very pleased. No more HP Pavilion 17 inch which I have 3 of and tired of poor quality and run very  hot."
5.0,"This bundle was exactly what I expected. They could even advertise as a 5 in 1, because of the mousepad that was included. The color was the same as onscreen. It was really easy to put the case on my computer and to put on the keyboard cover. This was my first laptop that I was buying for, so I was pretty concerned about ease of access. The one comment I have is that the edges of the keys on the keyboard are a little bit raised with the cover on, which was weird at first when I was typing but I have gotten used to it."
5.0,"I've been using this keyboard for six months now with a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet and I have no complaints whatsoever, other than my wanting for PgUp/PgDn keys. This lovely little keyboard goes anywhere I do. It fits nicely into a side pocket in my tablet's padded case. I've plugged it in to charge via USB perhaps twice since I bought it - but only because I thought it felt neglected, not because the rechargable battery actually ran out of juice!  It powers on and pairs quickly with hardly a hesitation. It's nice to be able to press a keyboard hot-button to switch instantly from typing on my Windows tablet, to type something on my iPhone, and right back again. I'd highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who finds themselves on the go with a tablet computer."
5.0,Works great.
5.0,Great product. Fit perfectly on my 2011 MacBook Pro 13.3&#34; display. The blue is the exact color you see.
5.0,WOW!!! A bit expensive but worth the money! On my way to 4k!
5.0,It work great thanks
5.0,"A much needed upgrade from my Razer headset, which died unexpectedly.<br /><br />A superb build quality. Comfortable. And very convenient controller with a single USB connector instead of having to connect mic/audio jacks separately."
5.0,exelent
5.0,Love the cover...
5.0,"It was more than expected , fits nice and all controls work well with it on."
5.0,"I received this modem a couple weeks ago, got the cable hooked up through a coax cable, plugged it into the power outlet, and just had to get on the phone with Comcast to get it registered.<br />It works great! Download speed is at 111Mbps (I suscribe to the 105Blast Comcast option) on Wifi, once the modem is connected to my router.<br />I have had no dropped signal whatsoever, and it works great for streaming HD shows on multiple device."
5.0,not for me
5.0,very durrable
5.0,the keys feel amazing and i love the two usb ports on the side and the ruler for a stand. from math to starcraft it works.
5.0,"This is the coolest keyboard, my son loves it. Well worth the price. Great performance too"
5.0,Very pleased with this product thus far
5.0,Its so small you forget you already inserted it.
5.0,Had it for a few months and it's running great. I'm not a computer pro at all I just wanted to play a few games with friends and this computer does the job.
5.0,This is a very good product because it fits perfectly for my tablet and it came on time
5.0,Works Great. Just as it said it would. I would suggest this for anyone who wants to watch Netflix while taking a relaxing bath.
5.0,"I'll start out by saying this is a really nice keyboard. Linux users: It works out of the box on Ubuntu 14.04... All the keys work (except the lower right-hand arrow keys. The gaming arrow keys work, however). Remapping keys won't exactly be cake, as it would be for Windows or Mac users, but who cares... you use Linux cos you appreciate actually understanding how things work! :P<br />This keyboard is perfect for programmers, or just people who type a lot, and hate reaching far for their mouse. The keys have just the right amount of clickiness and resistence. It is not hard to press the keys, but the pressure makes for accuracy of keystrokes. The keys, themselves are molded, and not smooth, flat, lifeless, like a mac keyboard or many laptop keyboards are. This, too, increases accuracy. I rarely make typing mistakes on this keyboard. It's a really nice change. I feel like I've seen the light. Never going back to non-mechanical keyboards, ever again!!!"
5.0,Lots of compliments on this case
5.0,This is an awesome laptop! I don't have a single complaint about this laptop other than the fact that it can be a bit hard to open at times due to the shallow notch where your fingers go to open it
5.0,Really good value for what you pay. I got the purple one. Great color and good quality.
5.0,Bought for grandsons. Worked as well as original and much better value than oem. Delivered on time and as presented.
5.0,"Love the color, love the case!"
5.0,Cute
5.0,This is just what I needed for extra USB ports.  Seems to work great.
5.0,This is a quality cable that is very flexible and just the right length for charging a phone in the car.
5.0,Fast shipping product was as described.
5.0,Nice little keyboard! I charged it once three months ago and it still has a charge being used every day.
5.0,Very nice companion for the Trio Tablet.
5.0,I built hard drive power switch with these cables. So far I've had no issues. Great quality.
5.0,Make sure u take the caps off ends before plugging in.  Works like a charm and has great build quality.
5.0,I've had this case for about a month and so far so good.
5.0,"Great looking, very sturdy, snugly fit, and doing its job as advertised."
5.0,"This is the greatest tablet I've ever owned.  (It is my third tablet)  It is fast, easy to use, and has some really great features. I especially love the sound quality it has - I plug it into a PC speaker system with boom box and it is actually better than my Hi-Fi system!  A friend of mine, who is a professional sound engineer, and works at a local radio station is amazed at the sound it produces as well.  I also like the quickness of the processor - I can  have half a dozen apps open and switch between them with no fuss.  I have actually stopped using my laptop, preferring the Lenovo tablet for travel.  I can do all my paperwork with it while on the road, pay my card accounts, etc. no problem!"
5.0,This was purchased for a laptop/tablet.  Worked perfectly.
5.0,"Works great, right out of the box."
5.0,A perfect fit.
5.0,"The fire HD 6 has an excellent display and the smaller size is perfect for traveling. Compared to my original Kindle Fire it is faster, clearer and has more features. I would defiantly purchase this device again."
5.0,"It is exactly I am looking for, very good quality."
5.0,Love my case
5.0,Great tablet for the price
5.0,wow
5.0,Love the GRID-ITs.  I'm not sure why colors aren't all the same price.
5.0,Works really well! Captures in great quality and easy is to use.
5.0,it was a gift for my mother in law and she said she loves it!! so win win
5.0,Works like a charm...perfect battery for my Sony VAIO (vpceb 36fg)
5.0,"Great Design!<br /><br />THE ONHUB DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT FELL OUT OF AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT<br /><br />with 13 antennas you get the greatest best incredible 5GHZ AC spectrum coverage, plus the intelligence of the Google Firmware combined with the quality of TP-LINK, No one can beat this in a hundred years!"
5.0,Fits my Inspiron N7010 perfectly. Has this projection at the bottom due to a higher capacity battery with rubber studs which raises the laptop at an angle. All good right now. Will add to this review after 3 to 6 months.
5.0,"Have been using this skin for over three years and I love it! Still on the first skin, as it comes with two."
5.0,pleasantly surprised how good this little router/range extender is. I use it as a range extender and it is awesome. Gives very good coverage to whole house.<br />I use the ZeeBee home automation built into the router and it works fantastically.<br />I would take maybe half a star because of some small interface problems with the home automation.<br />Over all very simple to set up and use
5.0,cheap and comfortable
5.0,Work out fine.
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,Working very well so far.. Can not beat the price..
5.0,"Using these fans on my H100i and i've got to say, their pretty great. I really wish they'd change the brown padding on the side to like, white or even black, but it's nothing modding can't fix! Pick these fans up if you want quiet, and great preforming cooling fans!"
5.0,just what i want
5.0,These worked fine with Nintendo DS - worked just as expected.
5.0,This is the second one i got and it does not work i do no if it was a bad bunch still have could not find the number could get help john
5.0,Fit perfectly
5.0,"Pretty good. Nice traction, fit my desk."
5.0,Great price. Works well. No complaints.
5.0,Its so good that it past a year and its like new!
5.0,excellent
5.0,Was thrilled to be able to fix my badly cracked screen all by myself!!  Looks wonderful!
5.0,"I worried that I wouldn't like a smaller Kindle Fire, but I love it and the improvements that have been made."
5.0,This item was just as I expected
5.0,Excelent
5.0,"Twice the speed of the TWC WiFi and nearly twice the distance in reception. Remember to place it in a high location, in the middle of the house will work best. I run 2 AppleTVs I watch Netflix on 3 devices and best of all, I have the lowest tier internet speed. That's how good it is."
5.0,Excellent Product...<br /><br />Thank you very much...
5.0,Received promptly and was exactly what I needed.
5.0,Exactly what is described a very good product.
5.0,Purchased for gift. Receiver loved it!
5.0,Easy installation. Faster computer
5.0,"I love the Kindle devices. They are easy to read, easy to use, and still have the feel of reading from a book. It is extremely convenient and more and more books are available in digital format at libraries as well."
5.0,"Very sturdy, love the hue of blue, elastic strap is good quality, snug fit for the iPad ... overall a well made case. The key board that came with it seems to work well and I don't have any problems with the bluetooth connection.<br />Very glad I made this purchase :)<br />The only down side is that it is a bit bulkier than my old case, however I now have a sturdier case with a keyboard. Just something to have in mind if you get it."
5.0,I love them.
5.0,My daughters and my granddaughters all love it!1
5.0,"So far, so good. Took me minutes to set up.  I live in a three story house with the wireless on the bottom floor so I had trouble getting a good signal on the second and third floors to stream netflix or Amazon. This little unit solved that problem. I was able to set up on the second floor and boast the signal.  Disclaimer-I haven't tried it on the third floor yet as I have no &#34;smart&#34; TV's up there but the signal on the second is so strong I have a feeling it would work."
5.0,"Easy to use, functional."
5.0,Really like this product and it adds a flash of color to my Mac!
5.0,Works great!
5.0,I travel from FL to CA every other week and usually have 4 or 5 devices with me.  Logging them into the hotel wi-fi individually is too much trouble.  This eliminates that problem by allowing me to log in one device and all the rest work automatically.
5.0,My only problem with this is that I cannot decide for the life of me where to put my things in here and in what position. Thanks RE4
5.0,Works great. No problems whatsoever.
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,"This hub works flawlessly.  I have been very pleased with my AmazonBasics purchases and this hub is no exception.  Many of the hubs in this price range are USB 2, and some don't even have a power adapter.  An unpowered hub is a waste of money and more aggravation than it is worth.  It is rare that a single computer USB port will have enough power for 4 devices at the same time.  The added advantage of having USB 3 makes this an ideal accessory, especially since most computers have only a single USB 3 port."
5.0,Works great on my Dragon Touch tablet. I applied it and then trimmed it to fit.
5.0,"This is the sweet spot of PC displays for me (so far hehe). Over the years I have tried triple monitor setups, 30&#34; 1600p monitors, widescreen TV's and even an 34&#34; ultrawide monitor @ 3440x1440 and this is the better than all of them. This has the height and width that really sucks you in and immerses you in whatever you are doing on it. The image quality is great for this large of a display size, text is perfectly legible, no fuzziness or distortion which I guess can be a problem with the smaller 4K monitors, dunno never tried a smaller 4K monitor just went for it with this one. Lots of display real estate for productivity and huge visuals for gaming. Setting it up to run 4K at 60hz was easy using a Geforce 980 ti card and performance it very sweet, if your graphics card can do Display Port 2.0 you are golden.<br /><br />Now the cons, colors and the stand. The colors seemed a bit washed out and needed a bit tweaking to get a bit more vibrance out of them, but it was easy to correct. The stand is the worst part, I really don't care for it; it has a strange angled design that just feels odd, also there is no tilt ability on the stand which is very inflexible. I feel like the stand could have been designed much better to suit this great display more appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately I love this display enough that I can't take any stars off for the cons because they just don't matter that much in relation to how much I am enjoying this display."
5.0,"Works great, holds a lot of video. I use it for storage with the dual dash cams mounted on my motorcycle"
5.0,"Nice and big. Great as an working pad. I personally dont even use the antistatic part of it... I just use it to work on top of it to not damage or stain my desk. But yeah, very nice and big area to work on."
5.0,I have bought two of these for both computers because they are easy to install and operate without a hitch!
5.0,Excellent!!  Worked as the way it should be!
5.0,"I am glad that I have made a wise decision for this attractive case. It’s sturdy yet lightweight. I have dropped my iPad for many times, no any damage even scractch happened. Functional product."
5.0,"Amazing fans, can't get much better for the price. With 3 colors of beauty rings included you can use it with almost any color scheme. Very quiet and moves a LOT of air."
5.0,"Great product, good value."
5.0,I decided to go with this device as an extender after reading the reviews. So glad that I did. It literally took 3-4 minutes from out of the box to working worhout any issues. I wish my router and modem were this easy. I'm considering buying another one to use as my main router as well!!
5.0,My case box was a little rough around the edges when it arrived but the OtterBox case itself was in great condition. Fits my tablet perfect and I don't stress if my young children get a hold of my tablet now that it is in a case.  I might cut the screen protector out of the case because it is pretty glossy and I already have a skinomi glass cover on my tablet.  Would purchase again!
5.0,Fits great. Better than advertised. I like this better then the SPECK case. Highly recommend. One of the better buy I have purchased in the past few months.
5.0,"Great value and has successfully kept my 17&#34; MacBook Pro safe as I'd hoped.  Big enough to carry lunch, sweatshirt and little stuff.  Overall just what I was seeking."
5.0,very good
5.0,Original equipment works as advertised.
5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks good, super cheap. I will definitely buy another when this one wears out"

5.0,Exactly as advertised and packaged well.
5.0,Great color con texture. Loved it!!!
5.0,Cute and packaged really nice. also arrived sooner than i expected. Loved it!
5.0,Works very well..
5.0,"Fantastic value for the quality! I use these every day for work video conferences, and although I look like Lobot from Star Wars, these are the best headphones that I've used yet. Not to mention, the sound quality is perfect for watching cat videos when I'm not paying attention in the VC's."
5.0,excelent
5.0,"I use this to run my small business and my daughters school work from. It works great, I got a case with keyboard for functionality, and it does everything I need it to."
5.0,"The StarTech DVI to VGA Cable adapter worked fine for my needs. Before you purchase make sure this the correct DVI adapter for your needs. There are at least three different types out there.<br /><br />This thing makes a stable connection and the VGA cable screws in tight.<br /><br />Overall, the StarTech DVI to VGA cable adapter works perfect, just make sure it fits your needs."
5.0,I love it
5.0,excelent
5.0,"Great flash drive with an incredibly convenient shape! I've owned mine for a few months now and it's been a lifesaver. However, it will probably work best for those who have smaller keychains or a way to protect the contacts from being scratched by other keys.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The drive corrupted on me recently, though it was likely due to user error. Keep this in mind, however, since it is relatively easy to bump it out of a USB port."
5.0,I have been using this cover for nearly 2 months and until now I have no any problem. It’s thin and besides the port for charging is easy to use. Great for the cost.
5.0,Product is just as advertised. Arrival time was earlier than expected...well pleased
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"I have an older version of this that works quite well so I thought giving this a shot would be a fun exercise.  The issue anyone has with this device, I think, is that it is AC.  That is the new format that replaces 802 and provides up to 500MBS transfer rates wirelessly.  That is great news on paper but very few of us have any AC compatible gear.  With that being said the device does work well.  On my one AC compatible device it really ramped up the speed and was easy peasy to to setup.  For the price this is a great item but just be aware you must have AC compatible devices to get anything out of it."
5.0,fits perfect

5.0,"Great product here if you need an enclosure but want to ability to quickly swap out drives with a tool-less design that works as advertised.<br />If you need the convenience go for this one or checkout their other models in their line up. Thank you Sunny for the awesome customer service and the opportunity to test the FE2006, this enclosure is just as nice as this model... either way with an Inateck enclosure you cannot go wrong. Great company with excellent professionals that will assist and be happy to answer any questions that arise after purchasing, these guys are top notch and their designs are going to change the entire industry for the better. Try this enclosure out and see for yourself, I was able to swap out drives in 11 seconds... in the IT world time is valuable and this product is going to save me a lot of time while looking good at the same time."

5.0,Excellent.
5.0,Clear display great quality
5.0,"just purchased this today and set-up was super easy.  Was online in literally 2-3 minutes.  Download the app, plug it in and it walks you through the 3-4 step process and it is a breeze.  Set it up in my living room, and i get pretty much full speed down in my basement which is something i didn't do with my older router.  So based on very initially testing the range on this things is great!  Highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />***update***<br />After 2 weeks of having this router it is better than my inital review.  I get wonderful coverage everywhere in my house and some outside now to where previously if i was downstairs or outside on my porch it would be very sporadic.  This does what it says it does, it looks nice and gives you outstanding wireless coverage.  For anyone who wants simple wireless coverage that will go above your expectations, get one now!"
5.0,working perfect
5.0,Thank you so much. Perfect timing for college.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:dd0611549646c51189ce37055bd7d809]]I am so very impressed with the fans elegant and concise design it has beautiful colors as well.  The good thing is that this fan is USB powered and comes with a usb cord.  It also can be battery operated as well. It is quiet sleek light weight and easy to carry.  I did receive this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my personal unbiased review.  It is so easy to just Insert the cord into the USB port. This fan is very practical and also makes a perfect gift for any of your friends and family. The soft foam blade is great for safety,it will not do hurt to your body.  This fan is not too loud and is a perfect addition to my desktop."
5.0,Great product!  Arrived on time~
5.0,Seems to be working great. Thanks!
5.0,Great product.
5.0,I bought this to replace an OCZ VERTEX 2 60GB SSD that died on me when the laptop went into hibernation mode. I'm very happy and satisfied with it. It is faster than the previous one I had. No problems in the hardware installation neither installing Windows 7 to it. I fully recommend it.
5.0,"Easy install, worked perfect."
5.0,"Love this case, this is my second on I purchased for my kiddos :)"

5.0,"Great product!  Small and inconspicuous, it converts my car stereo into a hands free phone, and mp3 player!"
5.0,"I do a lot of traveling.  I also happen to enjoy gaming a little bit, so sometimes I bring a hefty 17&#34; notebook with me.  I just came back from a 4 day trip, I was able to fit my notebook and charger, use the TSA friendly feature and have no hassle in TSA security lines, and then fit all of my clothes for the trip.  I like that it has a padded soft pocket at the top, for easy access for your need to grab items while traveling, (passport, headphones, etc.)  The build quality of the straps was great, I really am a fan of the product."
5.0,Love it!!
5.0,"This SD card work really easy, and the perform was as advertised."

5.0,Silver part broke off though.
5.0,Works as expected
5.0,Very durable device! Excellent for using with the kids! Highly recommend!
5.0,These cards are the best and a fantastic price!
5.0,"This keyboard is lightweight, easy to setup, and I've had no problems so far."
5.0,Works good.
5.0,This takes the place of 2 devices.  Had aluminum shell. Better quality than I expected.
5.0,"great seller, great product"
5.0,"Perfectly fits my 15 inch Macbook Pro (2012). I have no wiggle room left inside the case, which is just what I wanted."
5.0,"Love this travel mouse - it works perfect - great size, great feel"
5.0,"The color was a little brighter than the picture. But, still protects my computer very well!"

5.0,thank you
5.0,Good
5.0,Excellent
5.0,This is a really nice case with keyboard.  Very good buy
5.0,"Like other reviewers noted, the smart  adjustment system is stupid and the color of the leg is off but it is sturdy and easily assembled."
5.0,It's cheap.  It works well - multiple pockets and well-padded.  Don't expect a lot of room too much stuff; it's not a suitcase.
5.0,"I purchased this to convert a VHS to a DVD, and the product did just that. The adapter worked and the included software, while not particularly fancy, got the job done. For the price, I think it's an amazing value"
5.0,It is designed to fit any standard 3.5&#34; SATA drive and has 4 screws to hold it firmly in place.  Fits perfectly.  Indicator light flashes upon disk activity.    Some users are  faulting the hardware manufacturer when they have software difficulties?  I think that some users did not notice the side panels that hide the disk mounting screws.  No additional cables are required inside the enclosure.  Maybe some users are trying to use older IDE drives.
5.0,Used for over a month with no problems with Dell Inspiron 17.
5.0,Best mouse I have ever used so far. Works on just about any surface. Haven't tried it on glass... So smooth and has an amazing battery life. This is much better than my previous mouse which was the G700s
5.0,Perfect for the ipad air.
5.0,"I used this keyboard to replace the original keyboard after a soda shower and some faulty keys.<br /><br />Installation of the keyboard using the dell manual was easy for me but you do need some fine tools and a steady hand with the flat ribbon cable.<br />Keystroke on this Eathtek keyboard is pleasant, not too soft / hard. From time to time I do miss the backlight which I had in the original"
5.0,I used this to replace the screen on my cracked HD7 Kindle.  It was cheaper than a new kindle the tools and youtube walk through and it was fixed 30 minutes later.  My kids and my wallet were pleased.
5.0,"Great items, works flawlessly. Love the sliding capless"
5.0,"Works great and plenty fast for me. I did not test the speed, but it is faster than a standard card."
5.0,Very functional and not too thick or heavy
5.0,it was cheap and i bought it based on good review.. it is fast and i'm using this as portable hard drive for my macbook pro.  i like it so far. very stable and silent
5.0,My 12 year has had this on her chrome book for over 1 year - it's held up nicely.
5.0,Thank you...
5.0,Works Great. Exactly as described.
5.0,"I use these to make a stand-up desk at work. One at the highest point possible to hold the monitor, and one a little lower for my keyboard. They do not adjust easily, though, so moving from standing to sitting wasn't much of an option. I had a laptop in addition to the larger monitor (set up as dual monitors), so I could work on the laptop while sitting and on both monitors while standing. Interestingly, one (a black one) is somewhat sturdier than the other (the silver one), even though they are exactly the same product. Overall, this was perfect for me, since I didn't want to spend a fortune on a stand up desk, and the monitor stands just do not go high enough to be used for this purpose."
5.0,Has been working great....
5.0,"easy setup, good range"
5.0,Looked like hell immediately after I applied the skin. I thought I messed it up. 24 hours later I looked much better still had a few bubbles. Within 3 or 4 days the larger bubbles completely disappeared. The best skin I have ever owned. The fit to my kindle fire was spot on and it was much easier to apply than some of the other products on the market. Will be buying minimum for future devices.
5.0,good  quality and fast delivery
5.0,Works great and is plenty fast enough for my son's phone.
5.0,love it
5.0,It works well so far. Copied my old SSD to this one without problems.
5.0,Perfect for my G75VW-DS72
5.0,I bought this little memory card reader and it did a great jib.
5.0,great buy with windows 7
5.0,Feels great and the program runs smooth
5.0,Great!
5.0,"This Kindle is much nicer than the previous one I had, although I really like my last Kindle.  The new Kindle is more compact, easier to hold and the readability is better.  I did have trouble getting use to the touch screen and how the everything works, but the How to book that comes with the Kindle is very easy to follow.  Since I had my previous Kindle for over four years, habits develop.."
5.0,"Works flawlessly so far! Slick, black, and so far passes beautiful picture from my Surface Pro 3. My next experiment is going to be surround sound audio through this bad boy. I haven't really tried to do any of that even in the past so if it doesn't pass that with beautiful 1080p minimum I'll still be happy."
5.0,It is important nowadays to buy certain products with extended warranty
5.0,Nice color
5.0,"This is an absolutely Amazing wireless mouse! It's the perfect size for any hand and is extremely compact, which makes it easy to slip into a computer bag, purse or even a pocket. It's very durable too. I've dropped this thing and even had it squeezed in a tight space in my camera bag and it has not broken. The sensor is very responsive and the click/scroll functions are superb. I also really like that there is a little storage space for the USB chip in the battery recepticale. I always loose small things like this so I really like that I have a convenient place to store it. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a very responsive, yet cost effective, wireless mouse."
5.0,"Exceptional value, definitely the way to purchase Flash Memory. Zero hassle packaging."
5.0,"Best freakin stylus ever!!!!!<br /> I even brought  the touch 4 which is the Bluetooth version😀😀😀. If you are looking for a stylus this is the one for you, as a premed student that doesn't do physical books are notebooks this is a gem all my notes look as if I was writing with a physical pen on paper, I love it 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀"
5.0,"I couldn't be much luckier to have it as a sample. This tablet has exceeded my expectations. Honestly, this tablet performs better than a $100+ tablet. I have used a few $100+ tablets but this tablet works much better than them. All my apps and games run very smooth and without any error. I'd definitely recommend buying this tablet."
5.0,Works good
5.0,"Well done. Picture is great and the microphone works well. Then only thing is that the attachment is not sturdy, so attach it and don't knock the screen around. :)"
5.0,I'm satisfied with the product
5.0,Arrived essentially brand new works great out of the box. fair pricing thank you.
5.0,"Did the job!! Very nice would purchase again, and would recommend it as well."
5.0,"Works great on my Lenovo Thinkpad T450. Tried it on old Lenovo 20V power supplies, and on two different Lenovo travel power kits. Worked with everything."
5.0,"What's to say, after reading some reviews I'm just glad this one isn't a fake."
5.0,I'm so glad that have a new battery! I love not having to live near a power outlet.
5.0,as expected
5.0,"This case is fantastic. Cable management in this case is a dream come true. I can wholeheartedly recommend it to first-time PC builders.<br />Other good features include:<br />-Side panels that use thumbscrews to allow easy access.<br />-Screws that come in a plastic box with compartments rather than in little plastic bags.<br />-Tool-less 3.5&#34; Hard drive mounting trays.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the case is the fact that it features two 2.5&#34; hard drive internal mounting spots, but only one 2.5&#34; mounting tray. However, 2.5&#34; drives can be mounted onto 3.5&#34; trays, but you will need screws.<br />Overall, as long as you choose quality parts to put inside this case, you'll have a good time with this case."
5.0,"Very nice case, fits very well.  It's a little thick, but looks very nice.  For the money it is well worth it."
5.0,It's perfect. I can read any limited time easily.
5.0,"Nice built quality. Looks nice in my living room, which is also doubled up as my work area."
5.0,"I was worried for my friend with the Surface because she  wouldn't have wifi when she tried it, but it worked. It did come with a CD with drivers so in case it doesn't work easily for someone, you can  install several drivers for different versions of windows."
5.0,How many times can a 7 year old drop his Kindle?? With this case the kindle has been spared the cracked screen or loosened port death. Highly recommend.
5.0,No issues with xfinity here in Atlanta.
5.0,"I bought this external drive to transfer many manuscripts from floppy disks to my computer and flash drive. I plugged it in and it worked fine. No instructions came with it, but none were needed. It did everytrhing required of it, without a hitch or glitch. The price was right, and delivery was faster than expected--about three days. I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a floppy drive."
5.0,This is a good HDD
5.0,"This was so easy to use.  Connect the cables, open up your file explorer and the drives is there.  Worked equally well with my old SATA and IDE drives.  No issues with this equipment."

5.0,Bought this for my son for school. Great tablet
5.0,Bulletproof memory card!  Fast and decently priced.
5.0,It works perfectly in my ax3400
5.0,Great
5.0,"Easy to install.  No issues with responsiveness.  Note you may need additional Alcohol to clean the Tablet as the one Pad supplied with this item is insufficient.  NOTE:  When you remove the thin shipping plastic from your Tablet Screen, DOUBLE CHECK to make sure that you got it all.  There are actually two films that need to be removed.  The first is a protective layer for shipping, then there is a layer that actually covers the Glass on the Tablet screen.  When that one is removed, that is where you will find all of the &#34;Gunk&#34; used to secure it to te Glass, hence the need for additional Alcohol. The Gunk comes off quite easy and the installation of this product is a breeze.  I strongly advise that you keep control of it during installation and &#34;walk&#34; it from one edge to the next to avoid Bubbles."
5.0,Bought this for my daughters Nikon camera.
5.0,Excelente...

5.0,"This joystick rocks!  Great grip, easy to program the buttons!"
5.0,Great product and great delivery.
5.0,Crystal clear display; easy to use; sound quality wonderful
5.0,"I love these solar landscape lights, I have quite a few of them throughout our yard now. I like to use them to accent the trees and bushes around the house. Not only does it look nice when you have accent lighting shining on some of the larger trees and shrubs around your home, but it makes it a bit harder from someone to use that area to hide from view, so there is less of a chance of a break in.<br /><br />This light is very nice. The solar panel is close to 3.5\\"" x 6\\"" in size. There are two plastic thumbscrews so you can adjust and angle the light and the solar panel. Included are 3 screws and 3 plastic wall anchors for attaching to the wall. However if I were to attach this light to the wall I think I would use different screws and wall anchors, the ones included don't look very strong to me.<br /><br />Also included is a plastic ground stake. I prefer using the stake, I change my mind a lot and move the lights in our yard around quite a bit. The ground stake just connects below the light so you can stick it into the ground or inside a potted plant. Just make sure that the solar panel is in the sun so the light can continue to charge up during the day.<br /><br />The button on the back of the panel allows you to turn the light on and off, and choose between high and low for the lighting. Very simple to use. This light is not smooth around the light like the other ones we have, this one has ribs going around the light and small cut out areas around the edge. It looks nice but for me I think I prefer the smoother style the best. We get spiders here like you wouldn't believe and they just love little hidey holes to crawl into, plus any dirt that splashed up when you water or when it rained would collect there as well if you are using the ground stake.<br /><br />On a full charge you can get close to around 6-9 hours of light. I double checked last night and the light turned on when the light started fading outside and when I went to bed a bit after midnight it was still going strong. The light was still lit when my husband woke up for work at 3 A.M.  It looks very nice in our yard, I love being able to use sunlight instead of having to wire outdoor lighting!<br /><br />Free product sample received for review purposes.till going strong.

At first I found it difficult to fit the charger in the case, but there is a zipper pocket in the back where the charger fits perfectly! I store my Pro 3 Pen, flash drives, and phone charger in this case easily. Also has some nice padding and magnetic closures. Great buy for the price!"

5.0,"My box boots in 20 seconds. My win 8.x and win 10 systems fit adequately well within the 128 gb size, with room for more. I tell anyone who will sit still long enough how awesome this is."
5.0,Perfect fit
5.0,"Cant beat it! I'm not a gamer, but the mouse is fantastic for editing & even business, the buttons on the side work as back/forward buttons to switch pages"
5.0,Definitely solved my range problem ... Highly recommended !
5.0,This is an absolutely gorgeous cover and is well-made of quality materials. I have severe arthritis in my hands and the wide elastic band helps me to hold my kindle on create comfort. It's a great buy--can't recommend highly enough!!!
5.0,"I bought this modem router for our twins' condo at college. I wanted it to be compatible with their ultra current laptops required by their school of engineering, and I liked the idea of a combined cable modem and router from a convenience standpoint. Initially, during setup, I experienced problems in the setup, since I did not &#34;reset&#34; the unit first to factory specs. Since it was already used previously (I bought this as a used unit on Amazon.com at an excellent price), the former owner had set a unique log-in and password, and did not inform me what they were. But once I reset the box to factory specs, then the initial setup proceeded well and smoothly.<br /><br />After setup, one of my son's laptop was experiencing random disconnects from the internet which was very frustrating. The connection would come and go, and when it went, you would see a yellow exclamation mark on the internet icon in the task bar of the laptop screen in the lower right hand side. But then the laptop would just automatically reconnect to the internet again, and then the random disconnect process would begin again. The other son's laptop would lose connection to the wireless HP Officejet printer. In his case, we would have to &#34;reload&#34; the massive drivers again in his laptop over and over to get the connection reestablished, and then randomly, the problem would appear again. But his laptop (which is identical in model, hardware and specifications to the other son's) would never lose connection with the internet.<br /><br />After much diagnosis and stepwise problem solving, we realized that the sons were living in a high density student environment and that there were many separate internet networks active in the same building and nearby, with many of them operating on the same WiFi channels. In our location, these tended to be channels 11 and 6. Our own modem router defaulted to channel 11.<br /><br />This Arris modem router has a feature once you enter the program inside the modem router to fine-tune it, that allows you to conduct a channel scan of your environment, and allows you then to select a unique default channel other than 11, 6, or 1.  We chose channel 9 since no one else was using that channel. Once we did that, then the separate problems each of the two laptops were experiencing went away, and now the laptops have been continuously connected to both the internet and to the printer as well without dropouts.<br /><br />So, the takeaway we learned was to get to know our living environment well first, and then to fine-tune the WiFi operating channel  that would avoid competing channel traffic from surrounding networks in our location. Once we did that, our dropped internet connection and dropped printer WiFi connection problems went away.<br /><br />Setup with Comcast internet cable was easy and straightforward, and we were able to activate that modem router easily using the Comcast Xfinity set up program. It was straightforward and automatic, and we are now pleased overall with the Arris SBG6782-AC modem router!"
5.0,"The sound on these are way better than my old external computer speakers. Granted those were probably 7 or 8 years old, so dated a bit. For the price though, these are fantastic. Several people mentioned a rattling sound from the buttons on the front. I have not noticed any such noise, even when seeking it out. Great option for cheap external speakers."
5.0,"When you tablet does not come with a memory card and you want to play music or videos, this should do the trick."
5.0,Great product and price compared to the other named brand item that is overpriced imop
5.0,I know this router doesn't have features of the more expensive routers but it does everything I need.  I am using the 2.4 and 5 ghz bands conneting laptops and android phones alone with a wired TV.  I love the guest network and would not get a router without one if you ever have people wanting to use your internet connection and you change passwords for security reasons.  It has been up for a couple of weeks and I have had no issues with devices connecting and no issues with connectivity.  The admin interface is easy to use as well.  I am using this in a small condo and it has enough range to cover every corner.
5.0,very good case
5.0,"Very quiet.  I have 6 of these in my case.  Replaced the loud AMD water cooler fans with these.  Works just as well without the jet engine sounds.[[ASIN:B008N367IA Cougar Vortex PWM 120 Cooling CF-V12HP, Orange]]"

5.0,"Bought this for my brother and he absolutely loves it.<br />He drops his iPad a lot and so far, the screen hasn't shattered because of this tempered glass. Definitely a good quality glass screen protector."
5.0,"Great memory for a great price. Worth the extra money for this upgrade. No problems to date,"
5.0,"Nice, fast shipping, not much to be said about a micro SD but it is as described"
5.0,I hate getting a cable only to discover that the lightning tip is too fat to fit through a case. Thankfully this one is as close to the Apple branded cable as possible and fits inside both the Otterbox case and my Lifeproof case. I've had no issues with it showing any wear or having dropouts either. Great price too!
5.0,"I know these are for kids, but they also work well for adults with arthritis. The soft, flexible skin is easier to keep in my pocket than my metal styli, which would tend to stab, jab, and get bent in there. My only wish is this would be about an inch longer to rest on the thenar space between my thumb and forefinger."
5.0,"I actually mounted these to my kitchen tv to reinforce the terrible speakers the tv has. They sound great and couldn't have been more perfect<br />as they utilize the tv's USB port for power and plug straight into the headphone jack on the rear. Sound from these speakers is surprisingly good<br />and they will get fairly loud without distorting. I would recommend these for basic PC or laptop external speakers or for use as I did with them. You won't go wrong with this brand, the company has gone to lengths to produce good products and keep prices fair from what I've experienced."
5.0,"Excellent product, and outstanding customer support!  I had some problem playing movies on my ipad using  wifi and an sd card, the filehub plus app would not play the movies with sound, but after a few e-mails to customer support, I found that you need to access the sd card using the filehub plus app, long press the file name, and then choose another third party app - I used ace player - to play the movie.  A bit cumbersome, but it worked, and I used this little thing to provide wi-fi for my family, spare juice for my daughters ipad, I used it to wirelessly transfer photos from my sd card to my ipad, and now I can watch movies on it!  Great little gadget, and a great company!"
5.0,"Worked out great, met all expectations"
5.0,"Fashionable item. It works just as expected. Trust me, you cannot beat this iPad case for the reasonable price."
5.0,Excellent Quality. So QUIET! the L.E.D is perfect(can be turned off). The only con i have is i wish it had more USB Ports. But other than that it's EXCELLENT!
5.0,"I bought this to use with my Dell OPTIPLEX 980 running Windows 10.  I received it well packaged with no damage.  After reading the limited but easy instructions, I plugged it in my computer, the light did not come on the device, the computer did not acknowledge it was plugged in, there was just nothing.  I inserted the micro SD card for which I bought the device and still nothing.  I plugged it into my wife's newer laptop computer and received the same results as my computer. I can not say with any certainty if it is the device or if it is because I am running Windows 10, or that I have an older computer with USB 2.0 ports.  I can say that I have purchased a device that does not work.<br /><br />This is an update to my one stare rating:<br /><br />After posting my above review, I must say I am surprised by this seller!  I purchased the Saicoo USB 3.o 4 in 1 Memory Card Reader/writer - with a 13 cm flexible USB cord. I received it and could not get it to work at all.  I left my feedback for the item with a one star rating and chalked it up to either the device or my computer but unsure which.  The price was low so I just let it go.  Without asking the Saicoo company sent me a replacement device at no cost to me.  I received the replacement and plugged it in to my computer and it works just fine.  I am impressed with the customer service I received, Saicoo could have easily pocketed my money and said sorry about your luck, but instead went the extra mile to insure I had a working product.  Thank you."
5.0,"It is amazing how well this little device works. My modem is in a room which is almost like a &#34;semi-basement&#34; so,the wifi signal reaches only the most adjacent rooms. With this Netgear device, I have a very good signal in the rest of the house.<br /><br />Setting it up was not an easy task, but I got very good support from Net Gear's tech. people.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, great value for the price"
5.0,Great case
5.0,"I am very impressed with these speakers and is perfect size to travel with. The sound quality is outstanding considering that you don't have to plug into an outlet and it is rechargeable. If you enjoy music as much as me, you will get a lot of use from these speakers. Very easy to connect to blue tooth and has three sound modes to choose from. I did receive a discount and would recommend these product to anyone that enjoys music"
5.0,"Great product & was very satisfied. Customer service gets 5 stars as well, they reply quick & give you exactly what you need."
5.0,It plugs in to hp laptop with windows 10 and it shows the player I downloaded the software and it shows the start of a movie then disappears and says select a file to<br />Open ?  Not sure why?! I am giving as a gift and hope they can make it work as intended!
5.0,"Feels good, but thumb buttons don't work on MacBook, no advanced settings, have checked with the services, no solution.  Five stars to the post sell service, they're really nice, wish they can fix this problem in the future."
5.0,Great product and great sound. Just a I expected..
5.0,exelente
5.0,Wonderful! Great price. Well worth it.
5.0,I purchased this sleeve for my daughter's Macbook and she was happy with it.  Her happiness lends to my happiness.  Nuff said.  Thanks!
5.0,"There are two sleeves in addition to the laptop storage space in the main compartment. That can fit papers,  files,  tablets.  And the front zipper compartment for pen, small accessories and charger."
5.0,Love this product help protect my cellphone.Came with all the instructions I needed.Is good item I recommend.
5.0,First time I have EVER put on a shield for a phone or tablet and had no bubbles or bad words! This comes with complete instructions and everything you need to get it right. If I can anyone can.
5.0,its so comfortable now that my MacBook is safe!
5.0,Good carrying case
5.0,"Really satisfied with this I pad cover, good quality and inexpensive."
5.0,Got here on time and works as expected.
5.0,this was on sale for a much lower price than normal retail. i even bought 2. one was the drop tech. one was the glass tech. install is easy enough. the drop tech has a plastic screen saver pre-attached.  only minor issue is sometimes having to press hard near the corners of the touch screen because the plastic screen protector leaves a small gap between it and the screen in the corners. the glass tech model has a pane of real glass that lays tight against the screen and is usually $10 more and probably worth it. the army green color is perfect and the texture and raised pattern of the rubber gives you a much better grip than the naked aluminum of the surface. i was going to buy the urban gear brand but for the price i got these at it can't be beat.
5.0,"Since January 1990 I have been using computers, and the CybertronPC Hellion GM1213B Desktop is the best computer for the money that I have ever had.  Photo artwork (which is what I do) is resource demanding and there is plenty of power for the task.  An artist should suffer for and not because of his art and so the CybertronPC Hellion GM1213B Desktop makes creativity a pleasure!  Because of an early operator error a technical support call became necessary and that is when it was discovered what a pleasure that service is also!  I cannot wait to open the next box which by the way is packed so well!"
5.0,"Operate extremely well, and a great price to boot!!"
5.0,much needed
5.0,Excellent product!
5.0,I have a Vostro 1540 this is a perfect fit.  My old battery was dying which was causing overheating and random shutdowns (when the computer got to hot).  This new battery fix both of those issues.  The battery has the Dell logo and a made in china sticker much better then getting the same battery from Dell for 4 times the cost.
5.0,"Bought another one of these for my mom, I had one and she just loved mine so much, I had to buy her one since she fell in love with mine.  I love how it provides a great surface on your lap to type and also has the space for your mouse.  It also is versitile with the ability to use for your tablet and it provides the support for your wrists as well.  Wonderful product and I recommend for everyone as no a days, who does not sit there with a laptop in there lap at one point or another throughout the day!!"
5.0,"I love this mouse.  Quick, responsive.  Solid construction.  The software for it (synapse 2) is pretty easy to use."
5.0,"Lovey love love this bag. It's not leather, but if you tell people it's VEGAN leather they don't look at you like you're cheap. They look at you like you're socially conscious and I'm okay with that.<br /><br />Tons of room. I fit an umbrella, a sweater, my wallet, laptop, laptop accessories and my kids' diapers and wipes in this bad boy and I STILL looked good carrying it around.<br /><br />Cross body strap is perfect."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,great
5.0,"great product, fits mac book air 13&#34; perfectly. Soft inner lining, harder outer cover."
5.0,I had problems with the mouse when I first started using it. I have a wireless modem router and I had put the part of the mouse that goes into the usb right next to it. I purchased a 6 ft . male/female extension cable and that took care of the problem.
5.0,Fit like a glove. Seems to work fine. It's exactly what I expected it to be.
5.0,"Very nice carrying bag for the price!  I ordered this for my daughter to carry her school issued iPad in so it would be protected in her backpack. It fits a full size iPad comfortably and has a front zippered pocket for charger, accessories, etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,This switch does exactly what I expected it to. It works great.
5.0,So far so good. I put extra memory in it and it seems to go pretty fast.I also put my old hard drive in and windows recognizes it and have access.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:77ce86cce6f77caa4383831b0a645178]]There are three different hubs on the same product page - I have the 7-Port one, and my video is of it with Windows 10 and FlashBench testing with the same 64GIG USB 3.0 Flash Drive I use for all my testing...<br /><br />And I got far faster results than I normally saw prior although I have a suspicion Windows 10 itself may be why (I have seen better than usual results since I upgraded from Win 8.1).<br /><br />Very nice, very compact little cylindrical form, and the integrated cable is fairly long as such things go (believe me, they can get crazy, crazy short).  Does come with an optional power supply, but as I emphasize in my video - this doesn't make this hub or ANY OTHER data hub suitable for charging purposes.  USB 3.0 has a general limit of 900mA (0.9A) on amperage.  So if you want something that can also charge a device, you need to look for a hub that has specially wired charging ports included.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations."
5.0,I luv this smaller kindle perfect for reading !  Great product!
5.0,best mouse i use never change
5.0,Perfect for 13&#34; MBP. External zippered pouch with flash drive pocket a plus.
5.0,I love this skin and get so many compliments on it
5.0,PERFECT
5.0,"I had another different brand USB3.0 gigabit ethernet adapter which failed after a couple weeks of use, so I did not have high hopes for this product.  Luckily this product is still working for me after plenty of use! The speed is as expected which is excellent. This adapter does not have status LEDs which is how I prefer it, but some users might want that feature."
5.0,This mouse is sleek in design & works perfectly. Happy with my purchase.
5.0,Nice case. It works well with my iPad. Fashionable and useful.
5.0,It is a very good ssd storage
5.0,This KabelDirect 40W / 8A USB charger is definitely a plug space saver for me. Considering we have a lot of gadgets in the house sometimes it's so hard to look for a available outlet for me to charge my phones. I myself have four phones and this is just perfect for me. I can charge all of them at once using only one port from outlet. I also appreciate the LED light that lights up so you will know that the product is working. And the best part is the voltage is rated 100 to 240 volts. With this I can take it anywhere I go specially for those countries that uses 240V. It gives out an output of 2.4amp max which makes it higher than normal chargers I have. I was lucky enough to be able to purchase this for a discounted price in exchange for my objective and equitable review.
5.0,"I'm really really happy about this case!  It snugs my macbook air 13&#34; just fine.  Take note that unlike the hard cases that hugs the whole laptop for protection, with this, the corners of the laptop isn't protected and it's exposed.  So every time I put it in my timbuktu, I still have to make sure there's nothing in there that might scratch the corners and sides of my laptop.  Over all, I'm really digging the look of this case on my laptop.  It doesn't make my macbook air any heavier and because it's fit, it hardly changes the size, and the feel of it when you grab it in your hand is just nice; kind of &#34;cushiony&#34; feel."
5.0,"This is the all around do good digital pen, draws, writes, shades, and erases great."
5.0,Worked great
5.0,works great
5.0,I ordered this cover for my new iPad mini. It has a perfect fit. Amazing value at this price. You couldn’t miss it
5.0,great
5.0,"got this for my picture loving grandmother, she loves it as much as I do mine..."
5.0,Fast shipment and product seems  to do it's job
5.0,"Seems to do what I needed at this point. (just got them). Went on easily, and no bubble problems. Cuts way down on glare, as I gig outside a lot. Tried it out yesterday in the blazing sun. Nothing is 100% gonna cut out all sun glare, but these DO work far better than nothing! I could see my lyrics, so there you go! Can't go wrong for the price. Had to manually trim them for my 10.1&#34;  RCA Viking Pro 32 gig tablet (another great product for the money) on one side, but they do the trick! Happy guy!"
5.0,"This was purchased as a gift and so far the individual is very pleased. I've helped them get it setup and they are enjoying it. So far, the speed works great and it is the perfect size needed."
5.0,works like a charm. thank you
5.0,"Meets my needs, stays connected with minor maintenance."
5.0,I found this mouse very comfortable under my hand. This is what I was looking for at a good price..
5.0,THE BEST I COULD EVER DO FOR MY PHOTOGRAPHY LIVE
5.0,Very easy to install...just plug in and start typing!!
5.0,Exactly what I needed. This display worked great without a hitch.
5.0,"I really enjoy my new kindle, it is easy to use and offers plenty of useful and entertaining activities"
5.0,works great and protects the kindle.
5.0,"The ethernet cable kept falling out of my apple laptop - this does the job of keeping it in, even with movement."
5.0,Love my new computer bag!  I travel for work each week and this bag is perfect for the plane.  Thanks for a great design!
5.0,"Been using this mousepad for 2 years, stays firm on my desk and is great for its intended function. Would recommend to anyone."
5.0,Best computer ever!
5.0,Great product at a great price!
5.0,"Very easy to set up for extra hd space for the xbox, works great. No complaints so far."
5.0,Just what I needed working on my laptop and it saves me money on the electric bill by turning down the A/C a little.
5.0,"Bought if for my laptop, but, decided to get a smaller one for it.  This works great on my desktop pc. Just plug in the dongle and it's ready to use.  It's nice and easy to store the dongle on the underside of the mouse when you aren't using it."
5.0,"For its type (specifically, a soft case), it is a very good case. It's high-quality, and I am very satisfied with it. It's got these raised bumps of fabric in it to help cushion it more, and the zippers don't get stuck. Of course, a hard case is probably better protection for a laptop on the go, but as I am careful with mine (read: I have not smashed it to smithereens yet), this case suits my needs. It feels durable, and I will be sad the day I gget a different-sized laptop."
5.0,"Laptop Model: Dell Latitude E6420<br />Laptop CPU: i5 2440m<br /><br />Bought 10 pairs of these (along with SSD's) to bring some new life to some older but otherwise perfectly fine Dell E6420 laptops.<br /><br />Install is a breeze:<br />1. Remove screws from bottom plate<br />2. Pop off plate and RAM is exposed<br />3. Pull the two metal clips and the RAM will pop out a bit<br />4. Remove old RAM and slide new in sideways then push down and the clips will connect<br />5. Replace panel and boot<br /><br />You may get a warning that RAM has changed (a good thing!) and just check BIOS to make sure it's checking in. So far, so good (2 weeks now) and no issues for the users on the laptops. Ordering more for some old spares in inventory!"
5.0,Easy to install.  Works as designed.
5.0,great thanks!
5.0,Always great
5.0,"excellent cover, very classy looking but sturdy for wear. Im very happy with my purchase!"

5.0,very reliable item and last a long time
5.0,"I only use the Targus stylus.  I like the feel of it, the rubber tip glides smoothly and it has a title thing at the other end so I can clip my skinny lanyard type thing to it."
5.0,"Does the job, works perfectly."
5.0,Worked great. quick delivery.
5.0,A good wireless mouse in this price is awesome... It's working nice until now... I'll recommend this product...
5.0,Best headset every..
5.0,"Works and fits just like the OEM fan for my T410. I was getting a fan error on the previous OEM stock fan, the bearings were starting to seize when then cooled down. This fan has stock dimensions, connector, blade type, etc. Does not come with anything extra as far as screws or metallic tape, so be careful when dissembling the laptop. The overall process took about 45 minutes to disassemble, test, and then finally reassemble in perfect condition. As a note you will need to disassemble most of laptop including removing the CPU heat sink and pipes that attach to the fan assembly. You will also need/ should use fresh thermal paste when assembling and putting it all back together.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />Great product<br />Be prepared to take everything apart to replace<br />You'll need thermal paste<br />Be careful! It doesn't have extra parts!"
5.0,works as expected
5.0,"This is the absolute best external enclosure I have used. No problem getting 150 MB/s+ over USB 3(Win 8.1) with 3TB WD green drive. Love that you can turn off the LED bling if desired, but they're not offensively bright.<br /><br />Others have mentioned that it feels plasticky, and that's true, but only when installing the drive. After that it sits on your desk and looks like anodized aluminum. Just get it, you'll like it. I would not use it as a traveling drive--big, plastic, just not what you want for that.<br /><br />NOTE: would not work with 3TB drive in a single partition. I had to move data to other drives,  then repartition the 3TB drive,  move data back... big hassle. don't count on this working on big,  single partition drives. Still, love this enclosure, runs cool as a cucumber."
5.0,Exactly what I needed for my outdppr [rpkect
5.0,Great
5.0,"First, on a less technical note, the color of this thumb drive is cool and vibrant.  It prevents me from misplacing it which was a regularity for me specifically in my workbag. From a technical perspective it is very fast and can hold a lot of data.  My 11 year old middle &#34;schooler&#34; uses this to store all of his data for his advanced level courses."
5.0,"Works great, fast charge."
5.0,"Amazing, would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, casual, gaming laptop"
5.0,Just like the original one!
5.0,What a difference a good SSD makes for system performance! My power on to login time is around 11 seconds now.
5.0,Good quality memory fast delivery.  Thank you
5.0,"Easy to connect to laptop, kept it cool, and the blue light is not overbearing in darkness.<br /><br />Will definitely purchase again!"
5.0,Great quality for the price
5.0,Raises my Apple Monitor to the right height to avoid looking down and the resultant neck pain.  Matches the monitor and my MACBook Pro perfectly.
5.0,"Love this, it works great!!"
5.0,product worked as intended.
5.0,"This is great, love the colors."
5.0,Seems to work as described.  Over 300 foot range for me.
5.0,works great
5.0,Great protection for Macbook. Barely there. I am very happy I purchased this item.
5.0,This product works as expected it was very easy to use and it also comes with two ethernet cables about 6ft long. You plugged it in to the wall connected ethernet cable to wireless router then plugged it into the outlet in another room where I needed it and plug the ethernet cable into my desktop. I went from 2mbps wireless to 30mbps with this adapter. It works great and recommend it to anyone who would like to improve their internet connection especially if you are a pc gamer who is far from the router.
5.0,Get that NAS backed up / upgraded!<br /><br />:)
5.0,Works as advertised. No problems after a few weeks of using it
5.0,Easy simple and efficient! Highly recommended!
5.0,"Wanted a backup cord to my iphone 5S, to keep in my work travel bag.  Lower cost compared to other retail outlets, and just as good as the original one that came with the iphone.  No issues in synching either."
5.0,"The front works like's Apple's smart cover, but it's attached to a hard back for all-around protection.  Great price for a case with these features. Nice choice of colors, too (I got grey.)<br /><br />Minor quibble: the back is smooth, not textured like the front. I'd have preferred the same texture front and back, both for aesthetics and better gripping."
5.0,"Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter she loves it. I am impressed with this tablet worth the money, would recommend this for kids and adults."
5.0,very happy w/product would buy again
5.0,"Looks like journal on my ipad, was the exact look i was going for."
5.0,Very fast.  The first one I bought started losing data and crashing after about 3 weeks.  Called up and had a new one sent right away.  No hassle at all.
5.0,I have used 2 of them so far and they are great. It saves your MacBook Pro and keeps it like new.
5.0,"This is pretty basic – plug it in and you are ready to go.  At just $6.99, it sure beats the $24.95 I saw for something similar at both Best Buy and Fry’s and I can’t complain about the data transfer speeds.  If you’re in the market for a card reader for your camera’s memory card, I would highly recommend you buy this one."
5.0,Happy
5.0,"This tablet is near perfect! I was going to give it four stars, but that would just be insulting. There is only one downfall to this tablet, but once you know the way to deal with it, then you're left with a great great tablet!<br /><br />I'll address the issue right away to get it out of the way. This tablet has problems with updating and resetting. Whenever you go to perform one of these system tasks the tablet will begin the process normally, but then it will end up with a black screen. Now when people see black screens they tend to panic, I personally tried to turn on the tablet because I had thought it was finished, but it wasn't! This causes many issues and can brick your tablet, I luckily got mine to turn on again. The trick is that you have to leave your tablet on and plugged in, and even when you see the black screen don't do anything because it will eventually turn on with all the the updates installed. So to summarize if you go to update or refresh, sit by your tablet, have it plugged in and just wait for the black screen to pass because that is when the tablet is working. At the end you will see the tablet turn on to your lock-screen.<br /><br />Once you figure update anything that you have to then you can finally enjoy the amazing tablet. I want to start out by saying that for a hundred bucks you get so much more than I would have expected. I will start off with the build. The back of the tablet has very small ridges, but this allows for some added grip. Around the body of the tablet you will find a micro usb port, a headphone jack and your micro sd card slot. The micro sd card is very welcomed as there is only around 2.5gb of usable space when you get the tablet. On top of the great ports and feel it has a very sturdy construction so feel free to toss it in your bag and bring it around with you.<br /><br />Now on to the use of the tablet. When you're navigating the tablet it is extremely speedy! This tablet has never stuttered on me or slowed down. Now you obviously can't do anything to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed! It can even do some light gaming, like Asphalt and other similar games from the Windows Store. The display on it makes the overall experience even better! It has great colors and no back-light bleed. Even though it is lower resolution the tablet still has a pretty sharp screen, whether you're watching movies, playing games, or surfing the web it provides a great viewing experience.<br /><br />Overall this is a great tablet for both pleasure and productivity. I highly recommend it as it is very fast and overall a pleasure to use.<br /><br />~I was provided a free sample in exchange for an unbiased review~ng to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed!

5.0,"Works as a replacement for the Generac Mobile Link antenna!  I was happily surprised to find this out when the antenna that came with the mobile link unit broke and I had a need for a cheap replacement.  Although a good size smaller, it does work well and the unit seems to get adequate reception and transmission capability.  And honestly, it seems to be built better than the Generac mobile link antenna."
5.0,"This microphone made am amazing difference, it is clearly as described.  I use it for skype calls, and no longer am i plagued with &#34;could you repeat that a little clearer&#34;  comments.  This microphone made the difference.  DO NOT BE AFRAID to TRY IT.  No feedback, and I can once again talk, listen to music and not be plagued with noisy reverb on my calls.  Thank YOU for a wonderful product.  TWO THUMBS UP !!"

5.0,Great Product
5.0,Works great
5.0,"Buy these and hide them from your family members with devices that require Lighting Cables. These really work (unlike the bargain kind I've tried before, being cheap!). I LOVE the really short little cable, by the way. It is PERFECT for charging and syncing my phone right next to my laptop. The cord is short enough that it doesn't slide off the table easily!<br /><br />I am thinking about getting another pack so I don't run out, but I'm not going to tell you where I hide them."
5.0,Shipped fast way more than i exspected works great
5.0,"Love, Love, Love my new case...my tablet fits perfect (Galaxy Tab A 8.0 2015)!  I love the color and feel of the case it is stylish and holds my tablet firm and secure. I would definitely recommend."

5.0,"I love the feel of this cover! I have many covers, but this one looks professional and feels very comfortable in my hand. Going to purchase two more for other iPads."
5.0,"Perfect!  I do software development and, for the mobile applications I'm tackling, the Nexus 7 looks to be cream of the crop.  It hasn't given me any  alarming errors; not even a quiet burp.<br /><br />Arrival time was well within the expected time. Typical Amazon."
5.0,Very nice product that protests my iPad well.
5.0,My nephew loves it
5.0,Excellent!!!!
5.0,Who knew setting up a crossfire setup could be so simple. It is a very stiff kind of flexible cable but it fit perfectly and is working great!

5.0,"These headphones are by far the best I've used while on my PC. Their architecture and choice in ear cup means that they fit perfectly on my head - I don't even have to have the headband touch me if I don't want it to. They can just rest in place gently pressing against the side of my head.<br /><br />There is no USB soundcard, and I find this to be a blessing, for some it could be less than ideal. For me, no USB soundcard means no glitchy or poorly-featured software that I have to download to get fully-featured headphones. I plugged them directly in to the front side audio jacks on my computer, booted up my Motherboard's sound drivers, turned surround sound on and I was off to the races.<br /><br />The sound itself is wonderful. In-game I can tell exactly where a sound is coming from to the point where it has elevated my level of play. Some say that these headphones sound &#34;tinny&#34;, and I will say that when I test the headphones in Windows there is no &#34;thud&#34; in the digital sound where a subwoofer would be. However, from what I've experienced it does not detract from the experience. I'll test these with a bass-heavy song and then update my review."
5.0,"Great product, good price"
5.0,Works great for all my needs and is exactly what I was looking for!  I would buy more in the future.
5.0,"I bought this keyboard to go with my Icom IC-7600, and it worked perfectly. While you might want this keyboard for operating PSK, or RTTY , you may also want the Amazon branded 7 port powered USB hub. That hub will also work on your IC-7600 to expand the number of USB ports. You will have an extra  port to allow you to have the keyboard plugged in, and a thumb drive for recording  data out of your radio. without constantly plugging and unplugging your USB port.  The radio allows saving PSK and RTTY contact logs, as well as radio settings, and do firmware upgrades. The keyboard is spill resistant because of the way it is designed, and it looks great with the radio. It can slide under the radio just up to the from support legs.  Love it. I should have mentioned that the function keys do work when this is connected to my Icom IC-7600. F12 to transmit PSK, F1 to F4 for macro sends. As I said, perfect keyboard for the Icom CS-7600, and anyone with a need for a compact well made keyboard on a PC."
5.0,It's very good to use.
5.0,"Wow. Was this an easy upgrade. My son cracked the screen of his chromebook about 8 months ago by accident on a vacation. I figured it wasn't worth replacing. Went to dispose of it the other day and gave it a 2nd look. A quick search on Amazon I saw for $35 we could get a new screen. I gave it a shot and was that an easy, easy task. The bezel just unsnaps off the frame, 4 screws holding the old screen in place, and the ribbon connector to detach to remove the old screen, and the reverse to replace it with the new. 10 minutes at a snails pace. It looks great and my son is a happy camper. You will need a super small philips screwdriver. We used a #00 driver from a jewlers set."
5.0,Excellent
5.0,Works great with my Asus N56V. It's lighter and longer than the original cord.
5.0,Just what we needed. The original cord that came with our iphones would not charge the phones. This one is perfect for our needs with the length too.
5.0,Great delivery. Incredibly cheap. Works like a dandy - what more can I say
5.0,We needed to personalize my daughters chrome book and she loves it!!!
5.0,I love it..!!
5.0,Does the job!
5.0,Very good product!
5.0,work fine.  long.
5.0,Very easy to setup and I now have a very strong signal from the third floor to the basement.
5.0,Works good!!
5.0,Awesome bag for the price-- great small size and very comfy handles
5.0,The Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is everything I expected and more.  Email and photo sharing are a seamless operation with my Android phone.  And the display is brilliant!  I'm very pleased.
5.0,"Works as desired. Received On Time, Perfect Packaging, Flawless.<br /><br />Only thing to note for customers, If you are having troubles, Upgrade your bios. It worked for me after upgrading my bios. No Issue with the unit itself.<br /><br />My First Purchase at Amazon, Fully Satisfied."
5.0,Got this to replace my ugly Noctua fan on my Noctua NH-U14S.  Fit perfectly.  The Thermalright sticker is easily removable to give a clean look.  Matches my other black frame and white fan (phanteks) case fans.
5.0,excelente
5.0,The Fintie iPad mini case is a great fit and very easy to install.  It provides abundant protection and has a great look.  It would recommend it to everyone who owns an iPad mini.
5.0,Works well and delivered on time
5.0,"Very fast shipping. However, the battery did not fit my computer."
5.0,"I am so glad that I bought this for my son. Ever since he got this he has learned so much. He is saying number, words and he has gotten so good with the memory games. Thank you So much Nabi!!"
5.0,"IMO this is the best portable 2 in 1 device on the market! It's the thinnest and lightest one I have used and i love it. The M processor allows the battery to be reasonable and with the additional keyboard you have an all-out Windows laptop if needed.  Don't get me wrong this is NOT the most powerful tablet, laptop combo BUT it is the lightest and thinnest by FAR and because of the M processor it doesn't require a fan and doesn't get too hot.  The best M Series Ultrabooks are selling for $800 to $1,400 and they don't separate into a tablet, are thicker (when not including the keyboard on the CHI), and are not convertibles (flip it back to make a tablet). This is one of a kind and I just absolutely love it.  If your looking for an Ultrabook that's ALSO a tablet but NOT detachable (aka. Convertible) than check out HP Spectre x360, Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro and 3 Pro as these wont disappoint.  Asus has been making 2 in 1 devices like this for nearly 10 years and I believe they have nearly perfected the design ESPECIALLY for this price."
5.0,"Very glad I chose this case over any other brand or type. It fits perfectly, it's good quality material, and it just makes my Kindle Fire look really sleek. Everything works great on it. If I had other Kindle Fires, I'd buy this exact same case again."
5.0,Made well. Like looks and style
5.0,Works well.  Charged and calibrated according to Apple instructions.  Get about 2.5-3 hours use.  Good enough for me.
5.0,great one i like it
5.0,Good but not crazy about the shape
5.0,Cables were perfect match and delivered on time with no issues.
5.0,Awsome deal<br />Love it !
5.0,I carry this with me all the time.
5.0,"Delivered quickly, fit perfectly, works fine."
5.0,"This headset feels solid and well made. The cord is nylon mesh and feels like high-quality cotton (or a cotton-synthetic blend). It's not your typical thin plastic. And it's nice and long, with very clear color-coding for the individual mic and audio jacks. Plus, there's a handy volume control on the cord (though no mute button).<br /><br />At first, it felt a bit uncomfortable when I wore it for long periods, but not so much now. I've only been using it for about two weeks, though not every day (I teach online classes). Perhaps it's like a new pair of shoes that may feel tight at first but that become more comfortable with time. I don't have a large head, so your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I'm so far very impressed with the sound quality, including that of the mic, especially at this price point. I paid almost double, five years ago, for a very flimsy headset at K-mart. This one is bigger, heavier (though still lightweight), and more rugged than the last two headsets I've had. I hope it continues to surpass my expectations."
5.0,"First of all, the size of this mouse pad is perfect for both coding and general use (with a little bit of Pixelmator work) where I don't run to the edge while moving the mouse. There's a visible enhancement of the precision and the surface is very smooth (Mouse: Logitech MX Master). The mouse pad is sufficiently thin, so there's not much elevation for the wrist. Overall, this is a great mouse pad for the price and would buy again."
5.0,Great tablet for kids!!  My daughter loves it!
5.0,Perfect for my daughter. Loves the size and ease of setup. Great laptop at a cheap price.
5.0,"I received the ReadyNAS 3130 from Netgear through the Friends and Family Program.<br />The unit is sturdy, well made, and very quiet. It is sitting about two feet from me and I can't hear it at all. Ease of use is exceptional. The only problem with setup (as other reviewers have pointed out) is with the wizard. It asks you to push a button that does not exist on this model, but setup through the  web interface is only slightly more complex. One of the great things about the Netgear NASs is ReadyCloud. Being able to access your files from anywhere and being able to share them with anyone really opens up the potential uses of the NAS. The various apps that are available from built in anti-virus to a photo sharing app to several web development apps also also add a lot of utility.<br />I am enjoying using it and will recommend these to my clients for file storage and backup."
5.0,"All good things come in small packages...this one especially is value for money, well built, easy to operate and great quality sound (for the size and purpose)"
5.0,A Very good tangle-free charging cable - well designed and charges even touchy devices effectively.
5.0,Awesome
5.0,great one i like it
5.0,"Smell took sometime to air out, but love it."
5.0,Great desktop hard drives for an operating system.  Running Windows 7 Pro on them and the system bootup is great for a spinning drive.
5.0,Colors are as pictured.
5.0,Best case ever for a toddler
5.0,Chiclet style keyboard and comfortable mouse. I bought one for work after using at home for a year now.<br /><br />I bought the amazon basics one but the keys were traditional style and I found the long throw of the buttons annoying.<br /><br />Excellent for the price.
5.0,love it need to find a bag for it that will fit
5.0,I use this with Jamup Pro. I love it.
5.0,Fits everything just right.
5.0,I love this product!! I was nervous not buying an &#34;official&#34; Apple product but this item has proven itself to be quite reliable. The length is perfect. The price is very fair. And I swear it charges a little quicker than my old Apple cord.
5.0,"This fan is freaking incredible &#60;3 It's quiet & it gives really cool air. =o Also, you have the options to change it's speed & whatnot though what sucks is that you really can't turn off the LED lights xD Besides from that, I love it =DD &#60;3"
5.0,Easy and simple. Does the job good at a low price
5.0,Still going strong after a year protects my kindle well
5.0,Great product
5.0,"Works very well with iPad 2. This cover allows me to type on my lap with an inclined surface as opposed to totally flat surface. I can watch videos lying down or sitting up without having to hold the iPad 2 in my hands with the iPad2 in an inclined or upright position.  The inside pocket and banding provides enough space for a couple of sheets of paper should a document be needed for a meeting. Since we are in a paperless society, most of the documentation needed for a meeting should be accessible through an app or email on your iPad."
5.0,Works great for both my raspberry pi and my laptop for playing all my favorite retro games!
5.0,"My foster daughter has a Macbook Air that I occasionally borrow. It's the only Mac in the house (all of the rest of us have PCs). When I do use it, I try to keep it in a secure location- but occasionally I'm toting it somewhere and I want it to be in a case. I have a very simple bohemian style, and because of this I want accessories that kind of fit with what I wear. This neutral gray felt fabric with the leather accent was perfect in terms of appearance- so I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />The bag itself is very well-sewn. I do think it will hold up for quite some time. Because it's felt material it does provide a sense of cushion to it that will keep your Macbook safe. That's something I really liked about this bag. The inside of the bag is mold-proof and wear-resistant. It does seem like very high quality fabric and I don't think it will wear out any time soon. With that being said, there are a few issues I had with the outer fabric. The first is that I'm not entirely sure how to wash it? In a house full of children, things naturally get dirty and I try to get things that are made of materials that can be washed. I'm not sure if this one can be. It also has a very 'scratchy' texture to it, that picks up cat hair very easily. We have two cats, so that's something that I immediately noticed.<br /><br />It fits the Macbook Air perfectly and does hold everything securely inside. I feel a lot better carrying it around in this case than I did shoving it in a non-fitted bag. It looks very pretty and as it describes in the product description it does have a very 'British simplistic' appearance to it, which can fit virtually any style. It'd make a great gift for college students and business persons alike.<br /><br />It also comes with a small bag which I thought was a great added bonus. I can keep my USB, camera cord, small notebook, and pens in the littler pouch- and it matches the big pouch, which is just very cool.<br /><br />Overall, a great bag. Not sure how to wash it and the fabric does grip to pet hair. But it's very durable, made of high quality fabrics, and well-sewn. It'll definitely do its job of holding my Macbook secure while I travel.wash it and the fabric does grip to pet hair. But it's very durable, made of high quality fabrics, and well-sewn.

5.0,This keyboard cover was exactly what I was looking for! The color and print is exactly as pictured and it was extremely easy to put on my Macbook Pro 13 inch keyboard.

5.0,"Amazing perfect size laptop, great deal just looking for something to surf the net, this is perfect for that as well as nice lil gaming for the child no complaints so far we are loving this! Also love that the battery stays charged for long time!!!"
5.0,"One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.  The competition is 3 times more expensive.  It does move a little while driving but then again you probably shouldn't be messing with your iPad or keyboard while driving right? ;-)<br /><br />Highly recommended and I paired this with the Bluetooth keyboard that was suggested as well.  Very Happy with this product, quality, and value."
5.0,"different drive than advertised, but it is fine."
5.0,"Exactly what I thought it would be, it even comes with a keyboard cover!! Great purchase will definitely buy from them again"
5.0,Impressive speed and uptime
5.0,so cute
5.0,"I was honestly not expecting such amazing headphones for $40, but these headphones were amazing! The sound quality is absolutely wonderful, and as others have said it's completely comparable to that of Turtle Beaches. I have not tried the mic out yet, but I may adjust my review once I have done so."
5.0,Replaced old keyboard--works just fine--we are happy with it.
5.0,Died unexpectedly after many books were greedily devoured. Unable to resuscitate but grateful for months of dutiful service.

5.0,This case is awesome and has saved my childrens' iPad mini's from certain damage from dropping on many occasions.  The carrying handle is fantastic for small children too.  I highly recommend it.
5.0,GREAT SERVICE!GREAT PRICE!
5.0,Actually was better than I had expected.  Very functional.
5.0,Perfect case for keeping my tablet in. The inside is padded and I never have to worry about scratches. Super cute print!
5.0,Good product.
5.0,Loved the colors and flexibility of the case. Eye catching wherever I go.
5.0,Works great with my oldest computer which is still on XPsp3. Does what I need it to do.
5.0,Lizone has the best group of customer service that I have seen on the internet. They have called me several times after I bought the product to make sure I was happy with the product and purchase. I will buy from then again!
5.0,"I love my Kindle, even better than the larger, color, kindle tablets.  This help me better focus on reading books!"
5.0,We purchased the LaCie Porsche because it is compatible with the Mac.  It was almost too easy to install and download.  Love it!
5.0,Works perfectly.
5.0,Just what I wanted. It is not as flimsy and the one I purchased at Best Buy.
5.0,Works great! Never drops a connection.
5.0,I really like my case and haven't been able to find one like it locally.
5.0,These launch port sleeve are great. They simply &#34;SNAP&#34; on the launchport base and wall station. They charge quickly and look nice on the wall or table.

5.0,Very fast.  Big performance improvement
5.0,"Good product, don't have an complaints to this point."
5.0,Many thanks for this fine pen. Works as advertised.
5.0,"This case is WONDERFUL. It came very quickly and was packaged very nicely. The case snapped on very easily and is very easy to take back off if you want to remove it. The keyboard cover lays on the keyboard very nicely, it does take some time to get use to. The keyboard cover is rubbery so it did take some time to get use to but I've been using it for over two weeks now and I love having it. The keyboard cover keeps hair and dust and other things out from under my keys. It helps to keep my keyboard nice and clean. The protective screen is very nice to have, I didn't have scratches on my screen yet but when I saw that it came it was very nice to have as an extra protection."
5.0,I love it idk what else to say thank you WD.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Excellent product.  Perfect fit for my daughter's chromebook!
5.0,love it
5.0,"2nd one I've ordered.  Totally functional,durable & handsome case to boot.  I've had my first one for about a year and a half and my wife and I keep getting confused which one is which."
5.0,"This is a great product that arrived quickly and is very easy to use. I had no problems putting the screen protector on my 4th generation Kindle Fire HD. Just make sure that you get the correct style for the Kindle you have. When you look at the order screen, it will show several types of Kindles and how to tell them apart so you purchase the correct style. I also like the fact that I got a five pack of the covers. Now I can change them as needed, although I've found in the past, this isn't necessary very often. An added bonus is the fact they offer lifetime protection and will replace the covers and send new ones as needed. I recommend this product based on ease of use, quality, and warranty. You won't go wrong with this product."
5.0,&#34;Very nice product for the price&#34;
5.0,"We were looking for a USB-Micro USB adapter for an endoscope camera we recently purchased, to use with our smartphone in webcam accessory mode. This short adapter cable does just the trick. We've even found  use for it powering our mini USB fan via our phone and via lipstick chargers; which is such a great discovery as it gets VERY hot at the bowling alley during league. Having this adapter on hand beats paper fans any day of the week. The speed of charging when using this adapter to act as a proxy cable is just as fast as any of my USB cables thanks to the 2.0 port. The connectivity is great and the price is right, we received this unit for free, in hopes we'd share our honest thoughts- but will be buying another to keep in the bowling bag and laptop bags."
5.0,Works great put this in my PS4 in place of the old 500 GB HD
5.0,It is a very great flashdrive. I love it.
5.0,This tablet holds all the qualities a tablet should have. I got an offer from the seller to get it free for my honest review. I happily accepted the order and I've to say I'm lucky to have it. My gaming experience has been never this good on a tablet. It has an excellent display and the graphics are just too good. This is now my fav gaming tablet.
5.0,"Prefect size, easy to use buttons. Optional software to add shortcuts to buttons."
5.0,We have the old kindles but this one does a lot more.  Love it
5.0,Great  product. Love it
5.0,Great for saving all my embroidery programs.

5.0,Thanks
5.0,As advertised.....
5.0,Perfect for my Dell 7420 12&#34; laptop.  Love that zipper is on the end as I use this in conjunction with my Everki backpack to lug all the computer equipment around.  I can remove the small laptop without pulling the whole thing out of my backpack.
5.0,Fits Chromebook C720 perfectly!
5.0,"Excellent product, I have used three of these in the past. Only crib is that it should have a longer useful life. 2 of these stopped working at about 1.5 - 2 years of usage. Appears to be an issue with the optical sensor. The third one had issues with the left/right buttons.  Never the less, a great product while it lasts specially for people with long fingers. Most of the other wireless mouse are too small in size."
5.0,Excellent article
5.0,Great
5.0,Very happy with this iPad case.
5.0,Good
5.0,awesome ! Thanks!
5.0,works well and was exactly as expected

5.0,I am using 3 of these in a computer duplicator system.  All have worked flawlessly making over 50 copies since install.  I love the locking SATA cables supplied with the drives.  I have used Lite-On brand dirves for may years with great results.
5.0,Works exactly as described and provides more desk space.
5.0,Monitor is still working great. Very clear and fast. Nice size screen and very reasonably priced as well. Just what I wanted. Thanks

5.0,AWESOME product.
5.0,"Fantastic, low profile. Wish they had a 128 or 256!"
5.0,Bought 8 and used with my QNAP TS-853 and Love these drives. No failures. Reliable even with several accidental power outages. Start right up without complaint.
5.0,"I have Comcast cable and Wi-Fi included in an HOA contract at a condo.  The Comcast wireless router is garbage.  Every time we try to watch Netflix we can't because it pauses to reload, sometimes for up to a minute.  I thought it might just be slow internet speed (the condo is in the mountains), but thought I'd try a new wireless router first just for grins.<br /><br />Plugged this bad boy in and set it up with an iPad in about 5 minutes, and bingo.....problems solved.  No buffering, even with two people streaming different programs to different devices, much better range, must faster internet, etc. etc.<br /><br />Didn't check download speeds, upload speeds, or any of that IT stuff, but the proof is in the pudding.  This router completely solved my problem."
5.0,Love this cover. Great fit.  Very thin profile. Great texture Awesome price. I have owned a 'Kindle' brand cover for my Fire HD for a couple of years. This was less than half the price and feels of equal quality. Time/use will tell.
5.0,The color is beautiful! I was very excited to buy it!
5.0,Great deal of Prime day and I LOVE my Kindle
5.0,Love my case cute color and does what is supposed to

5.0,"for one who needs some organization in her life, this little bag keeps me honest!"
5.0,"This fits my Acer Chromebook like a glove... perfect fit and very protective. The zipper slides easily and does not come in contact with the chromebook's edge in anyway. The materials are high quality and look great, not like some cheap cases so commonly available. Case Logic makes great cases for gear - this is part of that wonderful lineup."
5.0,"I like the frosted color of this laptop hard cover. Although, i am doubtful about the quality if the apple logo shines through"
5.0,"Lightning fast -- I bought this when I moved into my apartment in Cambridge, MA, since I didn't want to pay a recurring fee to Comcast to rent inferior equipment (and I especially didn't want my bandwidth to be shared as an XFINITY hotspot). I chose it over the battle-tested Arris models because it was a good price for a future-proof modem. Who knows, someday maybe Comcast will have gigabit over DOCSIS.<br /><br />One of the neat secrets is that XFINITY actually provisions a slightly higher speed than the advertised tier, in part to allow bursting to a higher speed at the start of a download. This modem allowed me to take advantage of that. Even though the rep told me my Blast package is &#34;up to 105 Mbps&#34; down, it's actually at &#34;up to 150 Mbps&#34; in this area, and my speed test when connected directly by Gigabit Ethernet to this cable modem reached 178 Mbps. I'm about to get a [[ASIN:B00BUSDVBQ TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router]], so we'll see how it goes!"
5.0,Excellent.
5.0,"When I decided to make the switch to VoIP, I started with a more-or-less plug & play solution that I bought from Big Warehouse Store.  When my wife told me that the latency was too much (a common complaint among users of that device), I started searching around for other solutions.  The Cisco devices generally received high marks, and they're relatively inexpensive, so I decided to try it out.  So far, I've been quite happy.  The UI is pretty standard for Cisco/Linksys devices - if you've used any of their other products, it will probably look familiar - and is not difficult to use.  Many VoIP services provide configuration instructions for various devices, and the SPA122 is usually among them, so it shouldn't be difficult to set up even if you're not especially technologically proficient.  It also has the advantage of being small and easy to hide."
5.0,Love this product
5.0,This worked reliably. Bear in mind that is only rated USB 2.<br /><br />Recommended
5.0,very nice case for the paperwhite
5.0,"Does exactly what it's supposed to, and at a good price."
5.0,great product
5.0,Excellent Machine
5.0,"This flash drive is perfect!  I purchased this for my job...I'm an assistant and I take notes and minutes during board meetings. It records board meetings clearly and it's so helpful to have the file stored on the flash drive so all I have to do is plug it in and open the file when I need to type my minutes. Every time the recorder is turned off it saves that file separately, which is handy when you have multiple meetings a week. The microphone is pretty good as well, it captures the loudest talker as well as the softest talker of the group. This was a great buy!"
5.0,It works for all cameras
5.0,"This stand works great very good construction and very sturdy- especially on carpet. There have been other people who said there's some hardware missing but I didn't notice it. Probably because I don't have the two panels on the left of the stand in the picture. For now I only have the yoke, throttle (one) and the rudder pedals. Overall a very good product definitely makes a difference in flight sim."
5.0,As promised!
5.0,Great product
5.0,"This product is FANTASTIC! Most of these mounts are a couple hundred bucks!  Install was easy (did it all myself), and looks like a million bucks!<br /><br />Using 2 x 27 inch LG monitors."

5.0,good product
5.0,"Looks great, fits great, very happy with purchase and delivery."
5.0,Wonderful hardrive
5.0,Best purchase yet
5.0,Great power supply so far.  I stalled it beginning of Aug and use it every day.  Easy hook up.  Used it on a 530 series Dell Insp. and so far so good.  Much quieter than the original power supply.  I did bump up to 650W from the 300W (?) the computer had originally.    Update: ordered this item in July it is now Dec. and still working very well.  This computer is used most days and holding up well.  Very pleased.
5.0,This graphics card is just amazing. A great upgrade to my computer! Just look up the card on YouTube and look up all the specifications... but from my experience I can play anything at max ultra settings and still get a FPS of 120 or over. Dying Light looks GREAT with this card.
5.0,IT WORKED
5.0,Works

5.0,Great price and it works 100%
5.0,Works very well. I haven't had too many issues with echoing.
5.0,Fits perfectly and I like the elastic band to close it so you can put it in your bag and it stays closed.  I also like Pink.
5.0,wouldn't know it wasn't brand new if it didn't say it was refurbished in the description. works perfect.  the only thing I could pick at is that the charging cord is not apple brand and the little plug part was junk.  but that's not a big deal to me at all.
5.0,This has made a big difference in my device uses through the computer.  I especially like the buttons that turn off usage for stagnant attached devices.
5.0,"Good product, exactly as described."
5.0,Fit my macbook air and my husband's macbook pro perfectly.
5.0,"This SSD is small, lightweight, and lightning fast. My older desktop used to take a good 2 minutes to boot. And then logging into Windows 10 would grind along loading background apps for another couple of minutes. All the while, negatively affecting what I was trying to do. Now, the PC boots in 7 seconds. And when the Windows desktop appears, it's ready to roll.<br /><br />The migration software worked well. I had to get the contents of my 1 TB drive pared back to bare minimum (about 40 GB) to get the migration software to move the Windows operating system to the smaller SSD drive. So while the migration software will allow you to bypass some media files (music, videos, etc.), it doesn't offer the ability to pick and choose folders and files for migration.<br /><br />Here is what I did to get a clean set up: I backed up my data. I performed a factory restore of my desktop (the OS was re-installed onto the 1 TB HDD with no applications or data files). Total space used was about 40 GB. I connected the new Samsung SSD to that desktop with a SATA-to-USB cable (essentially like an external drive) and used an available power plug from the desktop PC. I used Samsung's migration software to move the Windows operating system to the SSD. I installed the SSD into the desktop PC (connecting the SATA cable to the motherboard). I disconnected the original 1 TB HDD to ensure Windows would boot from the SSD. It booted into Windows from the SSD. Windows was still activated (recognized as genuine by Microsoft). My PC originally shipped with Windows 8, so I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and then to Windows 10. At each point, Windows remained activated. With that completed, I connected my original HDD and use it for media and data files (you would need to get Windows off the original HDD, but I won't go on and on about doing that here when a Web search can spell out how to do this).<br /><br />NOTE: Each time I connected/disconnected power to a hard drive, I performed this action when the desktop PC was powered off.<br /><br />I can easily recommend this Samsung SSD. It offers a terrific warranty, and the drive provides enormous performance gains for Windows and my installed applications.sktop PC was powered off.<br /><br />I can easily recommend this Samsung SSD.

5.0,works great for all the different needs we have
5.0,"My Acer monitor was old, real old and was lagging when turned on and between screen changes; I stuck a fork in it.  Not being a technical wiz, I asked someone who is what he would buy if he were in my flip flops.  He said, &#34;Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!&#34;  The Dell Ultrasharp U2415 24in LED monitor was his response.  I put in in my Amazon Wish List.  He knows I game on Steam and said this would make the picture awesome; he was telling the truth.  While waiting to take delivery of our Zero Gravity computer desk I ordered the Dell monitor.  During the time from &#34;wish listing&#34; to ordering, Amazon had dropped the price enough to cover the sales tax.  WOOT!  Almost zero edge and an on/off switch that has only to be touched with the slightest of touches.  Way impressed with the monitor.  While the stand is really nice, I mounted the Dell on a mounting post with the universal mount.  Really pleased with the purchase."
5.0,I'm jealous that I bought this for my son and not for myself. The shape is quite comfortable and I just may need to &#34;borrow&#34; it from my son. :)
5.0,"No problems, been working non-stop for several weeks."
5.0,Love it
5.0,"Nice case, speaker and such are open so you can hear. Drop proof for sure#"

5.0,We purchased five of these for direct replacement of wired keyboards and mice.
5.0,"Yes they are ugly, but these are the best fans out there. Great static pressure fans for my case"
5.0,"This device meets my requirements, however,  in the future I will be purchasing other flash drives which also serve my purpose but cost less and are USB 3.0 flash drives instead of 2.0."
5.0,"I like it very light but, i thought there is special place for the charger cable.<br />any way for what i payed it worth 5 star."
5.0,"Works as advertised. Faceplate from DVD drive fit perfectly without glue, it may not with all drive plates, but it did on my Dell"
5.0,Was as shown. Works great. Fast shipping.
5.0,Worked as promised.  Arrived overnight as required for scheduled presentation.
5.0,"I love it, came in before I expected it, very good graphics, very fast.  Just be careful could not upgrade to window 10. problem with the graphics driver, crashed the system, had Microsoft put it back to 8 for now.<br />for the money its really very good, works better than I expected"

5.0,"Candy crush sleeve color bombs!  Great fit for my MacBook Pro 13.3&#34; with retina display even with the rubberized hard shell on.  Can slide my Magic Mouse in there with it too.  Great print looks just like the pix, well made, soft plush inside.  A no brainer for the price."
5.0,"These type of keyboards have progressed a lot in the last 4 years. I remember my first iPad keyboard was something like $100! Now these are 1/3 of the price with much better functionality. I was very surprised at the little bonuses this keyboard offers. This allows for landscape or horizontal viewing of the iPad, along with flipping if you do not want to use the keyboard at all. There are many functional buttons to hide the on screen keyboard, open up an internet browser, etc, which all work with Safari and other Apple apps!<br /><br />Additionally, there is a little gap when the case is fully closed for a stylus! The construction also seems very sturdy, but I have only used this regularly for one week so far."
5.0,"Bought it as a replacement for crossfired 6870's.  Smaller card but packs a punch in performance, it was a great upgrade."
5.0,I used this to clone my existing HDD in my 2012 MacBook Pro to a new Samsung 850 EVO SSD using Carbon Copy Cloner and everything worked well.
5.0,"I like this style case. The folding options are perfect for stand mode and can also be used as desk style for easier typing. I've dropped my iPad on its corner and the case protected the iPad. Very happy with this purchase. Love the hot pink!<br />If you found this review helpful, please click yes below. Thank you."

5.0,"great mouse, great price. I own this, as well as several friends and co-workers.  It's small, and performs perfectly. The small USB receiver is small enough that it can be left in all the time if you want."
5.0,"Awesome lightweight small 1TB device from SAMSUNG with Super high speed interface, but you must use a USB 3.0 cable, or the one that comes with it to get full speed.  Check any other USB cable that claims to have all the wires in it - many do not and they reduce speed by more than a factor of 10."
5.0,Product was as described. Received in a timely manner. Convenient and hassle free.
5.0,"100% connectivity, high-speed. All that was promised."
5.0,The unit sounds great ! The battery lasts most of the day while listening at work. Connects to my iphone 5s like it should. But the signal drops very easly... As long as i face the phone and the mocreo has a direct line of sight it works great even over 30ft. But even at 5 ft away if i put my hand over the mocreo the signal drops out !!! If i turn away the signal drops out !!  Another issue is the micro phone doesnt pickup as good as it should. Everyone tells me the sound is muffled. Ive positioned the unit on my front shirt pocket and collar. Is there any adjustment that can be made. I also looked in the microphone hole for any lint or obstruction.  I contacted the company about these issues.... They asked if it was ok to send out a new Clip R !  I said that would be nice.... They sent one out that day...  The new unit is much better !!!  Thankyou Don
5.0,It works great!

5.0,"great product,easy install"
5.0,working out great!
5.0,"I was upgrading from a mid-tower but didn't want to go with a full-size tower.  This case fir the bill perfectly.  Its the same height and width as a full tower, but roughly the same depth as a mid-tower!  Win!<br /><br />Aesthetically, this thing is very nice.  Its a good solid build that feels really well made.  Everything fits together great.  The case has tons of airflow through it.  I've not had any issues whatsoever with heat dissipation.<br /><br />There is plenty of room for my MSI Gaming 5 and GTX-970.  I use an H100i GTX and there is plenty of room for the double length radiator.  The SSD's mount behind the motherboard panel, which is a nice touch, given the hard-drive cage only has two bays.  No worries about that though.  You won't have any trouble finding places to mount HDD'ss because you can order a part from Rosewill to add 6 (I believe) internal storage bays.<br /><br />All in all, I love this case.  I expect that it will be in service a long time!  If you're on the fence about this case or another, go ahead and pull the trigger on the Rosewill.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />**One note on the other reviewers complaints about the sticker that covers the fan shroud on the bottom of case. Mine had it too, but apparently Rosewill has changed from a paper sticker to a vinyl one. Mine came off with ease and in one piece."
5.0,"Excellent Product.<br />At first i was discouraged from the bad reviews regarding the Surface Pro 3 and windows 10 beta. But Using the display adapters App it was the simplest thing, just connect to HDMI and USB on TV, Open the app, and on setting panel choose to connect to projecting adapter. It's literally that simple, specially with Windows 10."
5.0,"Grate and fast memory, SanDisk is just top of the line."

5.0,I want to buy it again.
5.0,"I'm  satisfied with this purchase.However I was very surprised to find the touch pad to be Android. I may have been mistaken  when I read the details of the touch pad, I thought it was Windows 7. But I'm not  unhappy with the pad. I have a couple other electronics that are  droids so this pad will help to better understand how androids work."
5.0,excelent
5.0,"Everything worked and the imperfections (scratches) were negligible. I ordered two units. One came with a dual VGA connector and the other unit came with a dual DVI connector. Try to request the one you want so you don't have to scrounge around for the right one. N.B., the DVI connector is not marketed anymore; I had to buy it on Ebay."
5.0,Awesome - As Advertised !
5.0,Works perfect and not bulky like my last case

5.0,Very easy to use and like the different color codes
5.0,Amazing clarity & quality
5.0,"Works well, what else can I say! It came well before the designated time, & I really needed a spare to go in my laptop bag, so I don't have to keep getting under my desk to unplug. Just make sure to put all the necc numbers & make, model etc. when you search!"
5.0,"Super bright! I bought this from reading someone else's review about they use it in their truck. I use mine for my car which doesn't have an overhead light, and it is a great and fast phone charger for my IPhone."
5.0,"I purchased this for gradschool this fall and I can fit everything I need in it. I can fit my laptop (I have a MacBook Pro) AND my tablet (Surface Pro 2) and I can fit most of my textbooks. I don't think I'll ever need to put all of that inside but it's good to know I can fit a lot inside. It has various compartments. The front compartment has smaller compartments to stick my phone, keys, pens, etc. There's even a pouch for a water bottle on the side. It is very comfortable on the shoulders.<br />I agree with other reviewers; it is not pink like on the picture. It is FUCHSIA."
5.0,cheap and nice work
5.0,I like it very much.
5.0,"Light, efficient, and practical! Great product."
5.0,works well
5.0,I got a lot of compliments for it :)

5.0,Worked fine and its cheap.
5.0,"I was hesitant in ordering the Kindle Voyage since I had the Kindle Paperwhite (2013 model) and was happy with it.  But after<br />waiting several months, I decided to try the Voyage.  I am an avid reader and read three to four books a week.<br />When it arrived, I placed it side by side my Paperwhite and the difference in the two screens was a BIG improvement.<br />Until you see the two side by side, it's hard to understand how much better the Voyage is.  I love being able to turn a page<br />without lifting a finger with the Page Press feature.  I had one of the original Kindles and this was a feature I had missed.<br />I enjoy taking it outside during pleasant weather and reading at night on my porch (and it is wonderful for reading in sunshine too).<br />This is the Rolls Royce of readers and I am so happy I decided to upgrade to it."
5.0,It takes a few tries to figure out how to fold it correctly to stand up but it has grown on me as a light weight easy to use cover. It weighs a lot less than my old book style cover and is not so clunky when I am reading in bed.
5.0,"I already have this brand and model keyboard attached to two other computers and the touch and responsiveness is exceptional, so when it came time to purchase another keyboard for an additional system system I chose this again."
5.0,very extremely good product<br />Love it.Easy to install.Very happy.Durable<br />Holds ipad close enough to the front to even plug it in to charge while playing<br />Highly recommended

5.0,"Switching out my old router (D-link DIR-655) has a made a significant improvement of my home network. Not only was it easy to setup but the interface was simple, security as I expected, but the improvement of my upload rate and download rate was the icing on the cake. The ability to monitor my network from my smartphone is a plus for me as well."

5.0,Shipping time was quick and the quality of the product appears great.  Have used it to assist me with undercover work where I needed to dock my terminal into a unmarked vehicle.  No problems noted and provided a constant power supply to my terminal.  Would get another if needed.

5.0,"Great card...great performance for the price. I have a  budget HP Pavilion so I had upgrade my Power supply to 500W.for the the PCIE 6+2 Pin. I gave the card 5 stars, however Rebate process is utterly ridiculous and painful. Gave up on applying for rebate which apparently what ASUS wants you to do! Don't buy the card for the rebate price! Buy it for the listed price for a great performing card. The Asus overclocking software is impressive and I found it easy to use."
5.0,Perfect

5.0,"I just keep buying these.  They're so easy to set up, I've got three now, and will probably have a few more to bridge/repeat my evil wireless signal further out into my yard, garage, neighbor's houses, etc.  Got a dead spot?  Less than a hundred bucks to completely fix it.  Going on 6 months with only one reboot so far, and I'm pretty sure that was Comcast's DNS problem, not this hardware."
5.0,"I purchased one of these when I purchased my Kindle, but my family used it for one of their cell phones and lost it.  I was happy to find it again on Amazon for a great price.  Works like a charm."
5.0,Great case. It's sturdy I love the handle and my 5yo loves that he can stand it up to play on it.
5.0,Best screen protector and anti glare in the market
5.0,loved it
5.0,"I bought this wireless NIC (Network Interface Card) for my new Toshiba C55 that I just bought from Amazon as well to replace its slower older technology 2.4ghz NGFF Wireless NIC.<br /><br />I am now getting the full ISP rate that I am paying for with my carrier, my download averages 42Mbps and upload averages 4.9Mbps. I am using Centurylink DSL service.<br /><br />It was super easy to install, and Windows 10 immediately recognized it. Thought there are a few things one should do before replacing your NIC in your laptop to mitigate issues with the OS.<br /><br />1. Disable the original card in Networking.<br /><br />2. Remove the Original Drivers from \\""Device Manager\\""<br /><br />3. Turn off your machine.<br /><br />4. Remove the battery.<br /><br />5. Remove the cover plates.<br /><br />6. Locate the card, and carefully remove it. Some may be held in with a mini-screw, and/or plastic clip. DO NOT USE A<br />MAGNETIZED SCREWDRIVER!!!<br /><br />7. Insert new card, replace screw and plastic clip if it was there.<br /><br />8. Re-assemble the laptop.<br /><br />9. Turn it on.<br /><br />10. Windows 10 should recognize the card immediately but it may be an older driver from February of 2015 (or around that time)<br /><br />11. Download the latest driver (both Wireless and Bluetooth) from the Intel website.<br /><br />12. Install the drivers.<br /><br />13. Reboot the laptop.<br /><br />14. Check your wireless network settings to make sure you now have 5ghz and 2.4ghz access points available.<br />NOTE you have have a 5ghz wireless router for these to show up. =)<br /><br />15. Your all done."
5.0,This 8GB memory kit is a god send. Turned my sluggish PC from a snail paced computer into lightning fast computer. Everything runs much smoother and faster. Installed very easily.
5.0,Came in on the 28th (when it said it would) and looks awesome!! Easy to put on and no air bubbles :) very happy would buy from seller again.

5.0,"Although it did not come when expected, it did work."
5.0,Great product.  Good quality. Very pleased with this purchase.  Love the dividers & pockets & the interior material.
5.0,"Set up was a breeze. Used it as a range extender to get a better signal for streaming from my blue-ray player. I had nothing but problems trying to stream anything for many months until I learned of this product. I set it up in my living room and voila, no more problems!! It works with my xfinity wireless gateway router. At first set up, I was still having some problems streaming, but went on You Tube to see if I overlooked something, because there were so many good reviews, I thought something is not right here. What I overlooked was that after easy set up, I needed to go to my settings in the blue-ray player and connect with the securifi almond instead of leaving it connected to my home network. O.K. I'm not the most tech savvy person, but now it works great!! Love it! I can even play my music files from my computer on my t.v. now which I couldn't do before, even on those days when it did stream. Would highly recommend!"
5.0,BUY NOW !!
5.0,"So far, the new Base station has provided a clear, stable signal, excellent for streaming movies and music in our house as well as our separate home office about 30 feet away."
5.0,"I like just about everything about this keyboard. The fact that I can even just put my phone in the trench to simply hold it up in front of me while I'm working on my work computer, is fantastic. But the fact that I can also switch right over to my phone if I want to type on it, is amazing! Honestly, the bluetooth connection for all the devices I connected was extremely easy and I didn't have any trouble re-connecting with each device, even if I didn't use the keyboard with that device for a while.<br /><br />The keyboard is a great size, has all the keys you need, but is still small and doesn't take much room (it doesn't show Pg Up/Down or Home/End keys on the arrow keys, but those functions work with those keys). It's hardy and well built, so I never had to worry about it falling apart on me, even when I tossed it into my laptop bag without anything protecting it.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this keyboard for size, number of buttons available for a small keyboard, and ease of use and connection and switching between devices. The ONLY thing that basically ruined this keyboard for me is the sound of the keys. At times, I'd be on the phone with people and typing away and they would ask me if I was on a typewriter!! Not that it's really that loud, but clearly loud enough to get people to comment on it. When I moved from a louder, busier office to a smaller, much quieter office, the sound of my keyboard was all anyone could hear and it just irritated the entire office, so I had to replace it with something quieter (which really broke my heart, because I LOVE this thing!!).<br /><br />If you don't mind the sound, this is an amazing keyboard. I'm not even taking off a star for the sound, but mentioning it here in case it could be an issue."
5.0,This DisplayPort to HDMI adapter cord works well without any drivers or software support needed.  It is truly plug and play between an HDMI component and a full sized DisplayPort component.<br /><br />I have used this to connect my laptop to a monitor on several occasions and it works without a hitch.<br /><br />This product was provided to me as a review item and this is my unbiased review of this adapter.
5.0,Great fit and function.
5.0,"Got it in a great deal at 50% off, when it was a must-buy. But overall, a well-made, highly functional product that has helped my iPad Air 2 become a more effective stand-in for my MacBook Pro Retina."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a relative and she loves it.  I have a similar case made by Samsonite which was MUCH more expensive and I love, but this one seems to be pretty good quality and you can not beat the price.  I saw the exact same case (not similar, the exact same one) at Office Depot and it cost about 50% more at their store.<br /><br />I bought it for my 60 year old Aunt, who is an accountant.  She was carrying a heavy computer bag and a separate bag for paperwork (which was also heavy) every day in and out of her office.  This case replaced both bags and now she doesn't have to lift or carry that heavy load in and out of her office every day."
5.0,Perfect fit for my ipad 2. Fast shipping!
5.0,quality out standing
5.0,"I love love love love this keyboard. After several months of use my keys are still sharp and they haven't begun to rub off, which is sometimes a problem with the amount of use my keyboard gets. Clicky keys make me feel productive as I type my thoughts away while blogging and working. When gaming this keyboard is super responsive. The light up colors are bright and adjustable. I love the purple, though the blue and red are also clear and probably somewhat brighter. I like the ease of changing the colors or even being able to turn the lighting completely off. If you are looking for a good quality light up keyboard I highly recommend this product."
5.0,"These are really small and work great for me. I use them on two computers, an old windows machine and my work computer with is a Mac Pro that I also game on. I find the speed and reliability to be above reproach.<br /><br />It was easier to set up on the Mac running OS 10.7.5 than it was on the Windows machine running Vista. I don't know about later versions."
5.0,"One of the best performing cards I've ever used. Paired with my i7-4790k, games run flawlessly on my 25-inch LG ultra-wide monitor at 2560x1080."
5.0,Works fine.  Great price.
5.0,"I bought this router because I live in a house of 15 men. The investment was fantastic because this router works perfectly! Before we used two routers and now we only use this one and it works even better than the two did. We also use an average of 600gb a month. How, I not sure, but this tough router handles it all. I would definitely recommend."
5.0,"good, would recommend"
5.0,love
5.0,"My husband is a tremendously picky, die-hard Mac user. He spent some time with this Poin2 Chromebook and ended up being very impressed. It's very stylish cover has a texture. It looks durable with metal inside. The 11.6&#34; HD screen is very sharp and &#34;non-glare&#34;--unlike the overly reflective shine of our Mac. Definitely, it brings really good value for cost.<br /><br />Since we already have a google account (guest log-in is possible, but is highly restrictive), it was very easy to login. We could then access a number of features that allowed us to personalize the computer, take photos with the camera, create documents/spreadsheets/slides, retrieve additional apps...In many ways, the set-up reminded us of a big Android Pad with an additional built-in keyboard.<br /><br />The Poin2 Chromebook has no disk drive, making it very light and portable. For this reason, my husband prefers using it to quickly get online and walk around the house using our Wi-Fi. The speed is there--this Chromebook is very responsive.<br /><br />It has all the necessary ports/slots: One for a Micro SD, one for HDMI, two USBs (chargeable 2.0 and 3.0) and an earset/ headset jack. The sound is GREAT--it beats out our old Macbook Pro. Since we already have an HDMI cable, we can readily hook this up to our television to stream movies/ TV shows on a much larger screen."
5.0,Awesome
5.0,"For those who may be experiencing a similar issue: For a couple months, my T420 has been getting unwanted key presses. Ultimately, those keys were either pressed permanently or pressing them wouldn't do anything (Control, 5, 6, -, =, ~ and Delete). This would happen randomly without any cause. I tried resetting the ribbon cable in the original keyboard but it just kept getting worse overtime (you can't do anything when the Control key is permanently pressed).<br /><br />At the end, I bough got this keyboard which fixed everything."
5.0,This was the best purchase I made.  Been using a USB headphone and getting iffy results.  Although this set is small the sound quality is excellant.
5.0,"Great product, the ear cover is a little small for me, but works great for my 10 year old son. They are comfortable, sound great and are easily adjustable."
5.0,Easy upgrade for my HP Elitebook.  So much faster and smoother now.
5.0,Love it
5.0,The Vtin® 4-in-1 Mini Display Port (Thunderbolt Port Compatible) to VGA/HDMI/DVI/Audio Adapter for Apple iMac/Laptop works with my iMac and the new monitor and I am very pleased with the quality of sound and picture.  This little device is great.  I am so glad that I was sent a sample for review that solved a problem that I was having with the iMac and the new monitor.  This is my honest experience with the adapter.
5.0,"Works perfectly, it allowed me to hook my older projector up to my computer without any issues."

5.0,Beats Vista - really happy with and the fact that they are there if i need help
5.0,"hard to find memory.  Overpriced bc of its lack of availability, but did the trick!"
5.0,"Fairly decent. The keyboard is a little hard to type with since it is plastic... but easy to use, especially in school."
5.0,Even at a higher price this case would be a very good buy. It's large enough so that the Surface slides in and out easily.
5.0,Works well in my GoPro. I have had no problems at all with it
5.0,"I like it! I mean is not unlocked but come on! I don´t need it unlocked to play some games on HD like The Witcher 3, runs fine on a MSI PC-Mate Z97, now running on Win 10 still good, highly recommended..."
5.0,"We got this for a friend, and I gotta say, Synology makes a damn fine product.  While this product probably isn't even made anymore, it's still going strong, and I am still amazed at how useful it is."
5.0,great
5.0,Just what I wanted to protect my new I pad air 2.

5.0,Meets what it says nothing bad about it
5.0,Worked perfectly.
5.0,"seems to be working ok, still with this video card Ark is still glitchy at times.  but Ark is also still in Alpha."
5.0,Works as expected - moving from device to device and Apple iOS to MS has not confused it at all.
5.0,looks good on my new apple pro.  Love the color
5.0,Love it.  Great camera
5.0,"Like new and works good. The only issue that we had was with using Chrome. The internet speed seems slow, but this is a known issue with these Tab 4 tablets. I tried the Samsung browser and it works better, so still 5 stars."
5.0,great product
5.0,"Upgraded Mac Mini RAM from 1 to 5GB with this bad boy. Didn't seat it correctly the first time resulting in a few beepy errors, but it functioned perfectly after a few wiggles. Good price @ $25."
5.0,Great keyboard.
5.0,"I have to say, I don't know why I haven't purchased this sooner. Prior to me purchasing this, I used to stream video games using Steam from my desktop PC in one room to my laptop in another room using my WiFi connection (802.11n). It would work fine for me, but I would get the occasional lag/choppiness in my stream because of dropped packets. When I purchased this, I tested out the in-home streaming feature of steam and I must say, this thing works FLAWLESSLY. It's literally as if my laptop is hooked directly into my router. I can play my steam games with the in-home streaming settings set to maximum quality with no issues whatsoever. 5 out of 5 stars for me; you won't regret this purchase."
5.0,"I love the color, size, apps and everything about it."
5.0,"I just needed a replacement cord for my iPad, it works just fine."

5.0,Performed as expected
5.0,So cute!
5.0,Great replacement for my internal adapter that drops and doesn't even connect at times.
5.0,Excellent--
5.0,"Came in very handy for the trip i was taking the week that I bought it. Nice size for travelling. I honestly need to sit down and read more about how to use it, but have not done that in the 3 months I've owned it because it was very easy to charge it up and start using it without any instruction. I do find that the charge runs down very fast, much faster than on my 4 year old IPAD. But I simply just plug it into the charger each night and have no problem. The price was great , $165 , no tax no shipping, and I see that it currently is down even from that low price."
5.0,I love it love it love it! It very light and inside is very soft!
5.0,"Excellent device with great Benefits. Self explanatory when it comes to usage, huge variety of books online you just have to find the time read as many as you can. I love it its definitely worth the money."
5.0,Nice
5.0,I was very happy with the over all condition and it was actually the color I wanted. Thought I had mistakenly choose the wrong one.  I much better on my eyes than my phone on a regular basis.
5.0,"Love, love this case!  Pleasantly surprised.  Bought it for my grandson to use for his WiiU.  Am so pleased with the quality of the construction and the material used.  Nice layout inside with a protective flap between the console and the game pad.  And, bonus, the price was so affordable.  So glad I was able to get one while they were in stock."
5.0,"I always like to have reliable, high speed memory, and this is exactly what I needed for my smartphone."
5.0,My first discrete soundcard.It was absolutely amazing
5.0,"I recently purchased the excellent ASUS Chromebook Flip and since it only has two USB ports, I decided to switch to a Bluetooth mouse for this computer.  I was not able to absolutely confirm how well this Logitech M557 works with Chromebooks in general, but decided to purchase based on overall positive reviews for how the mouse operates.  I am happy to report that it works VERY well with the Chromebook Flip, and I assume, most other Chromebooks with Bluetooth.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Connects quickly and reliably.  I turn the mouse off to save the battery when I put it in my bag and it still connects in seconds when it is turned back on.<br />- Good quality feel and button response, typical of Logitech products.  Wheel works well, and the left and right tilt buttons perform back and forward on the Chromebook.<br />- The Windows button brings up the Chromebook search / launcher - happy surprise here<br />- Looks - The shiny metallic look of the mouse is very nice.<br />- Bluetooth range - tested up to about 36 feet with the Chromebook Flip<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Nothing to speak of.  Wish it came with a carrying case, but am using an older Logitech pouch that works perfectly well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice mouse to use with a Chromebook or any device, and I expect it will last for many years."
5.0,"The whole setup is great! The transition from my previous, OLD computer was very easy and uncomplicated. Wonderful!!"
5.0,This item was perfect!
5.0,"This has a thick cord and durable connectors and joints, its quality is apparent and i appreciate seeing that in my cables<br />the only thing thats odd is the shape of the display port connector but that dint a big deal in the slightest"
5.0,"I believe it was a hit with our grand-daughter.  It was on her birthday list and she seemed excited about the gift.  She goes to college in Hawaii where it is normally hot, so that was the reason for the chill mat.  Thank you."
5.0,this makes my 3 year old dell computer work much faster great upgrade
5.0,It really is very fast
5.0,Good product
5.0,"the fan, or laptop cooler works wonderfully.  Got this for my hubby and he now has a cool lap and the computer works better than ever in not getting hot/warm.  He is a gamer, and can sit in a chair for a few hours doing this game or that.  Not noisy at all and I love the blue lights, not that you see much of it with the laptop covering it, but def will buy again for my laptop next pay check.  Oh and its not expensive, well worth the money I paid."
5.0,Working as it should!-no problems :)
5.0,Have had to purchase several of these over the years and so far this one has been the most reliable and does not get that hot.

5.0,The best product that I could find anywhere and less than half the price that I could find it locally.
5.0,"Basically a good 3-button mouse.  It works, does what it's supposed to do."
5.0,"Inexpensive and works fine, almost no noise at all, I like the big and quiet fan that have, runs fine with my MSI Pc-Mate, i5 Intel, GTX 960 SSC, 1 optical drive and 3 HDD..."
5.0,This is an excellent power cord. The quality is superior to the previous cord. If I need another cord I will definitely purchase an EZOPower cord.
5.0,These are always great...thanks
5.0,"As advertised, long and durable."
5.0,"Works very well, uploads quickly. Easy to install and use."
5.0,happy
5.0,I bought this cable to replace the old cable and it works great. The price is nice and much easier to replace to the cord than it is to replace the whole machine.
5.0,Excellent Thank You..
5.0,These have worked great at keeping our church iPads safe!
5.0,"Worked perfectly.  Plug and play, no issues, no problems."
5.0,"I'm a programmer and for programming purposes, it does it's job."
5.0,"I was looking for a kindle to use for reading and found this tablet instead. I've had the tablet for about a week now. It is not a high end electronic device but has replaced most things I use on my smartphone like: Kindle books, games (solitaire, crack trivia, backgammon, etc...), web browsing, movie streaming via Slingbox, Amazon music (blue toothed to speaker), email, etc... Adding additional memory was easy. For less than the price of a Paperwhite, I have a lot more functionality."
5.0,"Works great, fits right, just what I needed."
5.0,Everything as described
5.0,"Very nice, lightweight yet protective padded fabric sleeve. I like that the outer pocket also zips. and that it has a handle. This little sleeve fits well inside my basic laptop carry case and looks nice when carried into meetings."
5.0,Powered up a Lenovo M93P system in a new case with a new 750-Watt Antec ATX PSU with absolutely zero issues. Highly recommended.
5.0,Very good quality and really good service from the seller...
5.0,Plus a Phone too...

5.0,Started using ZyXEL based on reviews.  Right features for right price.  No problems.

5.0,Have to make sure the model number when purchase this. It fits flawless when you get the model right.
5.0,Great design.  Light weight and easy to carry.  The hole will not break like other ones that use a small rope.  This is perfect design.
5.0,"Bumping up the range in a large house can be tricky.<br /><br />I tested this with something even trickier.<br />I live on a lake, and the property slopes down to the water. When working, nothing is as peaceful as doing tasks on the boat, but some of my work involves Second Life.<br />This worked beautifully. If you are involved in data chomping activities, this is a little miracle.<br />Weighing in at about half a pound, it's easy to transport. Small footprint and the antennas are removable.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

5.0,"Great value, great quality."
5.0,This is very convenient.

5.0,"Disclaimer: I received this product of the &#34;WEme USB 3.0 Type C Male to Type C Male Charger & Data Cable&#34; at a discount rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on personal use and are not in any way influenced by the seller. Small, compact and easy to use. This USB connector was a great find. I like that it is easy to connect wherever I go and small enough to pack when I travel. I do have one already but, this is my backup so if ever I need another replacement, I have one available to use. A highly recommended product for electronic needs."
5.0,"Excellent value for the money.  Durable, comfortable, and high quality.  I put it on and take it off multiple times per day, and it's very easy to get the microphone positioned quickly and properly for Dragon every time."
5.0,"quick shipping, great price and product!!!"
5.0,I love the cover. It adds color to my macbook pro. The keyboard is less than I expected but it too adds something to the computer. I would have preferred the cover to be one piece but you have to stick each decal on a key. If I was leaving a review for the keyboard I'd give it 2 stars. Although the back cover decal is exactly what I expected and that is what I've given the 5 star review for.
5.0,Excellent...
5.0,Great
5.0,I love this product
5.0,I haven't used it much but so far I love it. So far can't tell much difference from my iPad.
5.0,No problems at all.
5.0,Compact and works great!!
5.0,Excellent
5.0,"Bought it a couple of months ago. Works great. Initially bought it for entertainment, but now I am using it for school to replace my heavy laptop. (beware, not intended to replace the laptop as it carries a mobile processor.) Other than that, I've had no problems w my tablet."
5.0,Love it.
5.0,Vibrant colors are what makes this case stand out. Love the tree effect.
5.0,"I have been using it in my cam for 5 years, and have not had any issues."
5.0,Love it!
5.0,very good product
5.0,Thank you
5.0,Good Quality
5.0,This is Good
5.0,"I have worked for a few months now trying to find the right combination to connect my Samsung home theater to my new projector.  The unit just would not push enough wattage to the projector through a 50 foot HDMI cord for it to not drop the picture.  I talked with the experts at the big Blue and Yellow electronics store about my issue, they were of no help.  I called SAMSUNG to discuss if there were something they could help me with, Huge waste of time.  I purchased the &#34;Monoprice 107700 131-Feet PREMIUM Metallic HDMI Active Equalizer Extender Repeater&#34; from Amazon and that was a fail, so I came back to try something else.  THIS IS THE FIX.  Finally the components all work together and the picture never drops no matter what."
5.0,just great for my use
5.0,works great!
5.0,Installed into my PS4.  Easy installation to perform.  There's certainly a noticeable load difference.  I mainly bought it so I don't have to buy hard copies of the games any more.  Plenty of room for storage.  Works great so far!
5.0,"Great value for this item. Bought one for self and one for my husband,  and we both love them"
5.0,really handy backpack! didn't expected it to be this good! I totally recommend it
5.0,My iPad has survived a two year with this skin on!<br />Will definitely buy another one.
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,"This battery worked just as described.  Well packaged and includes any necessary tools.  Great company to work with. Thanks, Ken & Wendy Dignan"
5.0,Could ues

5.0,Perfect. Just what I needed.
5.0,very helpful and comfortable to use.
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for!  Shipping was quick, and I got the memory card carrying case right away.  Thanks!"
5.0,"Perfect fit. Love the ease of folding it back. Easy to hold, like for reading Kindle. Get this."
5.0,"The desk is great and works as advertised.<br />Suggestion for improvement: The edge of the legs should have a non-skid/non-slide surface. If you place the stand on a smooth table top, it keeps moving due to your pressure on the keyboard. The movement is very slow (the stand moves about an inch during 3-4 hours of working). A small rubbery sheath on the legs would make it much better."
5.0,"works great, transfers are a fast 3.0 with this unit."
5.0,I bought this to supplement the amplifier I bought for my sister who's hearing is almost gone. Nothing wrong with the unit but my sister just didn't want to wear anything on her. This mic is a clip on to a shirt.
5.0,Love it thanks !!!!!
5.0,"Awesome travel tool. The all in one design comes in handy when I need to charge a device, repeat a wifi network for greater range, or take advantage of my own wired hotspot."
5.0,The case worked very well
5.0,i prefer wired mouse but i just want it to give it a try.  and what a surprise.  very accurate and consistant that comes from gamer mouse and i'm enjoying using this mouse a lot
5.0,"Awesome case, slim and sexy"
5.0,One drive out of 4 died before being able to configure the RAID. Sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement in no time. Now I'm happy with a RAID5 config. I was hoping to have it done on the first shot but a dud drive is found every now and then. Thanks Amazon!!!
5.0,"First, the packaging and the unit are both typical for quality refurbished units.  You should expect minor cosmetic flaws – it’s a refurb unit, but mine is overall very clean.  There is a minor scratch on the keyboard near the right hinge that I can’t see unless I put it under a lamp, and a small dent on the back side of the screen, approximately .5mm deep and 4mm from side to side.  I could do without either of those, but seriously, it’s expected and if you actually use one, you’ll make a few of your own scratches or dents in short order anyway.<br /><br />When I first turned it on I got an error which, from experience, was probably from a failed Win10 upgrade.  I was annoyed that it had been attempted, but the Win8 recovery was automatic - I don’t think I had to hit 2 buttons (there was a recovery partition preinstalled).  That took just a few minutes, and then I was up and running.<br /><br />The keyboard is, as described in other reviews, absolutely top-notch for a tablet.  I’ve tried others, and none have even come close.  If you have giant lumberjack hands, you may have problems with it, but seriously, other than the size which comes with the 10” tablet territory, it’s an absolute dream.  I’m typing this review on a Toshiba Tecra, a $1000+ laptop, and the keyboard response and feedback make it a 10.  I’d give the Acer tablet keyboard a solid 9.<br /><br />The mouse pad is responsive too, but there are no distinctive buttons (they’re there, just below the surface).  Left-clicking can be done anywhere on the pad, but right clicking has taken me a while to get used to.  The pad seems very solid too.<br /><br />Another thing I love, which I have not seen on other tablets I’ve tried, is the strength of the magnets that hold the screen to the keyboard.  You can literally hold it by the screen and shake it, but the keyboard won’t come off.  Somehow though, removal is easy:  open the unit, grasp the corner of the keyboard assembly and the adjacent corner of the screen and kind of rotate the screen off.  It holds when it’s supposed to, and lets go when you want it to.  The variety of screen placement configurations is nice, and that’s one of my favorite things about this tablet – it’s really the best compromise between laptop and tablet I’ve seen.<br /><br />The screen is incredibly sharp.  Colors are vibrant and clarity is impressive.  Speakers are worth noting, as they’re louder than any other tablet I’ve owned.  If you’re planning on watching videos or movies on this unit I think you’ll be quite happy with the audio levels.  If not, there’s an audio port on the left side of the screen.<br /><br />Battery life is also good, just shy of 8 hours of constant normal use.  If you’re thinking of using this as a GPS (which is actually one of the secondary reasons I bought it), you will probably want to get a car charger, though the packaging insert says to let it discharge to 10% before charging, and explicitly warns against overcharging, or leaving it plugged in after it’s charged.  From my experience with these devices, you’ll want to heed that warning.<br /><br />When looking for negatives about this unit, here’s what I come up with.  The USB port is on the keyboard, not on the tablet/screen portion.  I wish it were on the screen.  I don’t expect to use the unit without the keyboard very often, but if you are, plan on not having the USB port with you.<br />However, all other ports are on the screen, including a micro-usb and you can easily plug in a usb adapter cable to it.  Amazon has them here…<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-5in-Micro-Host-Adapter/dp/B00B4GGW5Q/<br /><br />and here…<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters%C2%AE-2-Pack-Micro-USB-Adapter/dp/B00GM0OZ4O/<br /><br />Another thing, and I’m kind of grasping here just to make this review well-rounded, is the way the unit sits on a hard table or desk when it’s opened.  If the unit is in the laptop configuration and opened less than 90 degrees, there’s a wide non-slip pad that holds it to the desk quite well.  But if it’s opened 90 degrees or more, that big pad lifts off the desk and two very small pads take over.  I think they’re more to keep the bottom of the screen hinge from getting scratched though, and they don’t keep it from slipping around.  (Note that this only happens if you're using it like a laptop.  For instance, if you flip the screen around and close it so the back is against the keyboard and the screen is facing up, all the non-slip pads are in place and the thing grips to a desk very very well.)<br /><br />In my opinion this will not be an issue for 99.9% of users.  And the other .1% should just buy a piece of non-slip material to rest it on.  The rest of us will be using this thing on our laps, or sitting on a surface inside a case.  And overall, I think 99% of the people who pick this thing up will love it.quite well.  But if it’s opened 90 degrees or more, that big pad lifts off the desk and two very small pads take over.  I think they’re more to keep the bottom of the screen hinge from getting scratched though, and they don’t keep it from slipping around.  (Note that this only happens if you're using it like a laptop.  For instance, if you flip the screen around and close it so the back is against the keyboard and the screen is facing up, all the non-slip pads are in place and the thing grips to a desk very very well.)  In my opinion this will not be an issue for 99.9% of users.  And the other .1% should just buy a piece of non-slip material to rest it on.

5.0,Great fit! Took the glare off of my kindle when I use it outdoors!
5.0,Works great!
5.0,"After trying a huge number of cases for more than 30 different devices, I have to say these Mosiso ccases remain the most satisfactory of them all."
5.0,"Works great! We plugged in the Ethernet to the LAN 1 on &#34;the local&#34;, plugged a phone cable into the line jack, ran it out about 300 ft and plugged it into the Line on &#34;the remote&#34; unit. I could then plug the computer into the LAN 1 at &#34;the remote&#34; and it connected beautifully! We even have a junction in the middle of the phone line and it still connected without a problem."
5.0,Came in good working order. Easy to install.
5.0,Work better than I expected.  Exactly what I needed.
5.0,Works great! Thank u! Great price too def be coming back!
5.0,"I've been using this for over a year in a Lenovo Y50 and it's performed fantastically without issue.<br /><br />Read and write speeds are exactly as spec'd, storage size is more than I needed, but great if I go on vacation and want to bring movies to watch.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the new EVO 850 which seems like it's even cheaper and faster."
5.0,OK
5.0,"Good product, good seller.Nothing to say."
5.0,"Absolutely, revived an old PC!  Ridiculous improvements on speed.  Now the main PC I use at work rather than a laptop with external display.  Very easy/quick plug-n-play install.  Comes with a mount too! You be dumb not to purchase this! Cheers Transcend!"
5.0,No issues...fast delivery.  Works as expected!
5.0,Great battery.  Lasts about 3 hours.
5.0,i like this... Works so good...
5.0,A delight to type on.
5.0,"I bought a bunch of these for my daughters playmates, age 6 thru 10. Great little android tablets. Stand up to a lot of abuse."
5.0,worked great
5.0,Just love this kindle
5.0,"I used this in a 2014 Mini Countryman with the HK stereo, which produced alarmingly terrible sound when using just the AUX port with my Android based phone.  This pairs with the phone and dramatically improves the sound quality. The switch over to bluetooth call mode is also flawless."
5.0,"Large beautiful screen, nothing but perfect, should have purchased it a long time ago. No technical terms here... it either works or it don't... this one gets the job done. No regrets here. Enjoy!"
5.0,truthfully this will give you a great hands on idea of what switch to get and i highly recommend it before you go out and get a 100-200 dollar keyboard and just hope you like the switch that you got.
5.0,perfect fit and color.
5.0,"Fantastic Otterbox case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab A. Otterbox is my go to brand for cases whenever possible, due to the fabulous quality.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great tight fit to keep your galaxy safe.<br />2. Additional plate functions as a tablet stand.<br />3. Built in screen protector.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. None!"
5.0,I'd been using my wife's older Kindle so when this offer came up to purchase I took advantage of it.....reading in daylight or low light is quite easy...love it.............
5.0,"This mousepad is actually a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  I thought it was going to be like a standard mousepad but I guess that since this is somewhat of a gaming mousepad, they made it a bigger.  I have nothing to complain about this mousepad.  Yes while most people are thinking, &#34;it's just a mousepad&#34; the QcK does not feel like those cheap China mousepad at all and it's great for everyday use and moderate gaming (I'm not a heavy gamer so that's why I said moderate).  All and all, i see why so many people have bought this mousepad!"
5.0,looks great and very cheap
5.0,Great product at a great price - working perfectly.

5.0,This bag is wonderful.
5.0,Perfect
5.0,Perfection for wow
5.0,"This thing is seriously solid, making for a very heavy heat sink and stable upright stand. The quality couldn’t be better, perfectly matching the Mac finish. Excited to have more desktop free space and to have the peace of mind from the extra cooling and performance. It is about time someone created a product like this!"
5.0,"Great cable that can handle a huge load of data transfer. I needed a really powerful extension cable to attach between my laptop and my external network card (so that I could put the damn network card+antenna next to my ceiling where the WI-FI signal is strongest. Not like I can glue my laptop to the ceiling, yo..) anyways, this works perfectly. I livestream video using the external card that is attached to this cord, and this extension cord handles without a single problem the huge upload/download bandwidth I chug through it."
5.0,Got here fast and it worked
5.0,Fit perfectly in my aluminium 2008 macbook
5.0,This SSD is a beast so far no problems and make my computer boot up in like 10 seconds love it to death
5.0,"We purchased 4 of these ViewSonic Monitors. Clear and sharp looking.  The integrated speakers are good for most users, but the max volume is slightly low for my taste. We kept external speakers for one out of our four users."
5.0,"Works great with my 6300 and r9 270, comes witht the two 6 pins required for the 270"
5.0,Best  design .worth price.
5.0,"I have gone through the hassle of setting up other economical modems, modem-router combos and they have all let me down with their performance.  This one is rock solid, never lets me down, fast and simple.  I just bought another one for my son and got it going in his house.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,"Feels great in my hand and is able to do everything I need it to. I will definitely be sticking with the Logitech G series of mice for as long as they continue it because I have yet to be disappointed.<br /><br />Besides the great functionality, the device also looks stylish and matches the theme of most gaming computers. It also does not look out of place on most desks."
5.0,"Work as desired, great quality, should def buy :)"
5.0,Works great and the shipping was fast
5.0,Works great and provides protection all around the iPad Mini 2.  Wake/Sleep works fine too.
5.0,Great item at an awesome price! Worked like a charm!
5.0,Was just what I needed.  My computer is working and charging well.
5.0,"Only had this for 4 days so far. I'm getting used to Windows 10, and the Toshiba. I've always had HP prior to this, but so far so good..."
5.0,.  Great Price!
5.0,Very happy with the product and the speedy delivery. I increased my computer's ram from 1GB to 2GB. Now it runs much faster.
5.0,Works! Its a cord...
5.0,"From the time I took the product out of the box, I was quite impressed with the appearance and style of the computer.<br />The keyboard is well laid out and very easy to handle.<br />The screen resolution is brilliant and vibrant.<br />It was quite pleasing to have the machine start in a matter of seconds.<br />The speakers are good; I was able to hear from a couple of feet away which is impressive.<br />As a former Vista user, I was quite impressed with the Windows 10.<br />I found it easy to learn and quite functional<br />All in all, this is a product that I would not hesitate to recommend."
5.0,"very cute on the new keypad , functional great tool."
5.0,"Bought 4gb memory upgrade kit for my 8 year old MacBook Pro, great price & works flawlessly. Thanks Guys!!!!"
5.0,"I received this router free as part of Netgear's friends and family program.<br /><br />I've reviewed a few of the latest generation Netgear routers and by now I've come to expect a certain level of performance and ease of use. After installing it in a relative's house, I'm happy to say that this one lives up to the standard from the other Nighthawks I've owned.<br /><br />Setup like usual, was a breeze. Although this particular model supports DSL connections, it can also work on cable Internet connections. I installed it on a Comcast cable line without a problem.<br /><br />After logging in to the router management interface, it immediately notified me that there was new firmware available. (nice touch). I clicked on the icon and it took me to the firmware upgrade page and I proceeded to upgrade the firmware.<br /><br />The router has been running a couple of weeks now, and my relatives have been extremely happy with it. They say the connection has not dropped and the wifi signal is strong, even towards the edge of the house. If they're happy, that means less calls for me to go over and fix things which makes me happy. Highly recommended."
5.0,Excellent Thank You..
5.0,"The five stars shown is for the TC941. The case is lightweight, sturdy and easy to type on, even with my large hands and long fingers. The unit is safe and secure within the case, the fit is perfect and the ease of setup and functionality of the unit makes this an excellent choice for an iPad. Very pleased! I highly recommend this unit and I can say from first had knowledge that the Customer Service of Anker is the best I've encountered."
5.0,"Exactly what I ordered, and I received it quickly. Worked great with my HP computer with no issue."
5.0,"An absolute steal. I have the monitor connected to a 13&#34; retina MacBook Pro, using SwitchResX to get 4k resolution at 52 hertz, which is more than smooth enough. I also hooked up a PS4, which looks great at 1080p using the built in game mode. The build quality is lower than an Apple Cinema Display, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it. The stand wobbles a bit but its virtually a nonissue.<br /><br />If I ever need another monitor, I'll buy another one of these."
5.0,"Great Poe, great price"
5.0,The card works well with it's own software - but other programs such as Cyberlink Producer also work well with it.  Great Capture Card.
5.0,Excellent
5.0,like the ability to turn on and off individual devises.
5.0,Love it
5.0,I am satified with my purchase of this Original Lenovo battery. I am getting a battery backup of around 3-3.5 hrs now.
5.0,This case for the ipad air was a great rigid compact case. Made of sturdy material and folds up nicely with a clip to hold closed. The keyboard works flawless and connects very easily via Bluetooth. I have not charged the keyboard since I received it.
5.0,Product as described fits perfect and is better than oem.
5.0,"Great price, works flawlessly."
5.0,wow.  I've got a helluva 5.1 system in the back of my office but it's sometimes...a bit much for the workday.  These are perfect for front desk speakers and delivery a  good sound for self amplified computer speakers.  Very impressed.
5.0,"Works in a Mac pro 1,1. Very satisfied."
5.0,"Got here quick, slim, easy to install, snug fit, looks great (clear and shiny case does not hinder the look of the laptop) and the keyboard cover was a lot better quality than I expected. This is an awesome deal for the case and cover combined. VERY happy with purchase!"
5.0,Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
5.0,"These are best usb cables that I had. I have many gadgets that require micro usb and all of them are my daily drivers so when it comes to charging and data transfer its very important to have have good quality and reliable cables and this is exactly what it is. So far didn't had any issues. And the variety of colours will suit everyones taste, amazing!"
5.0,"I adore having the extra length, it makes everything so very much easier. Using with my 5s and I have had no charging problems at all."
5.0,Fantastic!
5.0,Works perfectly!
5.0,"Just a great simple, inexpensive case."
5.0,as expected
5.0,So far so good. Working great and writing about 17-20 MB/s on win 10.
5.0,Worked as described. No problems of any kind.  Used it with a WIN7 box. Nice price too.
5.0,Setup was easy and worked perfectly in Windows 7.  Wanted to use it to be able to use my Bluetooth headset connected to my computer (which unfortunately doesn't have built in).  Setup and pairing of headset took a little more than 5 minutes including downloading updated vendor software from their website.  Controls from headset to iTunes functioned flawlessly once setup.  Would definitely recommend if you need this capability.
5.0,Types better than I though. It was easy to pair and very light. I own several foldable keyboards but I find the balance between the size and usability to be the best.
5.0,Great. Fits great
5.0,Never had an issue with this device. It was fairly easy to install and definitely fixed some problems I had in my house with the signal not travelling far enough.
5.0,This PSU is great. Exactly what I wanted. Nice and sleek design. 500W is more than what I need it for. Had to upgrade older psu since it was store bought and I needed more wattage for a graphics card. Can't beat the 3 year warranty. Shipping was fast. Got it in no time.
5.0,"Great quality for the price, an overall great microphone"
5.0,Great Product
5.0,No issues. Works like as it should.
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,Was not available in Mac store or Best Buy.  Price is still the same as 2011
5.0,"Not a bad selection!  Superheroes, artsy stuff, generic rock and roll, vans warped stuff, some name brands, graffiti style, about 20% cartoon kids stuff, same for girly stuff...  plenty to use for me at the price...  large 2 to 3 inches and nicely printed<br />I Do Not think these would hold up in a Wet environment, but for simple decoration, it seems like a good option."
5.0,Convenient charging!
5.0,all items worked fine
5.0,"Works great. You have to be in line with the screen for the best view, but for the cost, a great tablet overall."
5.0,Everything was Ok with this purchase.
5.0,"simple, easy and effective. great adapter"
5.0,good quality
5.0,"Love the feel of this mouse in my medium-large hand. The adjustability is adequate--I have it adjusted as tall as possible, as I prefer a mouse to fill my hand. And this has the best feeling,  tactile middle button of any mouse I've ever tried. For gaming that's not necessarily important, but for productivity it is nice. I also do some mechanical CAD that relies heavily on the middle button, so this feature is essential to me, as I hate mushy middle buttons. EVGA's software is great because it is LIGHT and doesn't get in your face all the time. One note about the carbon fiber version... it's pretty the first time you pull it out of the box, but it's a gloss finish with the same feel as the non-carbon version. So don't hesitate to buy either - - I have both, one for home and one for travel."
5.0,"Came as advertised, no problems yet."
5.0,Beautiful. Nice quality and fast shipping.
5.0,Does the job.
5.0,Excellent !!!!
5.0,Very Good!!
5.0,Great card
5.0,Excellent Product
5.0,Exactly met the advertised features.  Quick delivery
5.0,I needed a nice and flawlessly working tablet at an reasonable price. But I'm glad to have it as a sample for my fair review. I've to say this is the tablet I was looking for. It has great display and has a very responsive touch. I love playing my favorite games on it and al runs smoothly. This is surely my smoothest gaming experience I've ever had.
5.0,Great
5.0,Great item fit great!! Great seller!!
5.0,Awesome.
5.0,Works great so far. I've had it for a week. Good price  and fast shipping.
5.0,"This was for my son to carry his comics in.  I was thinking that it would be a bit thicker and he would be able to carry a decent amount in it, but it is so skinny that he could only fit a few.  He still loves it and is very happy.  Nice thing with it being so skinny is that he doesn't take as many comics when we go places so he doesn't leave any behind now.  The leather feels very soft, and the stitch work looks clean.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,The color and feel were just what I expected! Love the magnetic type of snap too. I feel it protects my Kindle too!
5.0,Perfect Perfect Perfect!!
5.0,Thanks
5.0,"pretty, and fits perfect"
5.0,Easy to install. Great for apartments.
5.0,works with time warners basic cable package
5.0,Works perfectly --- and much better than replacing the kids laptop!
5.0,I love the back light.
5.0,Excellent Product
5.0,Met my needs for a network backbone and server connection point for a small to mid-size business.
5.0,Delivered as expected.
5.0,"After struggling for 2 years to keep an Amped SR range extender on line (with its incredibly cumbersome set-up procedure), I finally gave up and bought an Almond. I installed one of these for a tech-impaired friend a little over a year ago, and he was pleased, so I thought I'd give it a try. What a difference! The set-up really is a breeze (which I already knew), but the performance of this visually inoffensive little device is as good if not better than the Amped SR. I have little else to say because all you do is follow the on-screen instructions and walk away. It even comes with its own stylus to make it easy to tap out commands on the little screen. I found the weather display pretty useless (did not update temperature often enough), so I set it to display the time. I don't care though because I didn't buy it to be a thermometer. I would recommend the Almond to friends and family without reservation."
5.0,It's so good. I use it inmediately.
5.0,Perfect.  Had an older model that was good but this one is much better
5.0,"Could not ask for a greater product, easy to use. Love the size. Well built."
5.0,Super quick Downloading
5.0,"First time buying a Fantom Drive to replace a 6 year old WD desktop BU drive that had died.  I like the fact that it had a backward compatible 400 firewire port to work with my server.  Was impressed by the solid aluminum metal build since the former WD was plastic.  I purchased a returned item from Amazon at a steep discount, someone had already formatted/partitioned the drive so it was basically an easy Plug'n Play install.  I would appreciate the absolute quiet operation of this drive (it is silent), but its hooked up to a fairly noisy server that has 6 fans and that advantage is lost in my case!  Quite satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,Two GTX 980 with SLI works well with my dual monitors on high resolution. Playing any new games on ultra setting.
5.0,Good product!
5.0,"Purchased after my last hard drive (different brand) decided to quit. So far, it's working fine."
5.0,"I love this laptop!! You can actually make local phone calls on this while doing your work, and yes, you can play games on it to.  I purchased a mouse with it and I love it!!!"
5.0,excellent sale
5.0,Love it!
5.0,Works great! My son loves being able to set farther than 2 ft from the outlet.
5.0,Excellent snd has a very wide coverage
5.0,"This battery will legitimately last you (on high powered settings) 4-5 hours. When I'm simply weird processing, it has lasted upwards of 7 hours. I haven't sat streaming movies or playing dvd's it hours but suspect it would hold up reasonably. This battery far exceeds the OEM NiMH battery. When that one was new, under the best circumstances I could barely squeeze 2 hours out of it.<br /><br />As others have said the battery fits into the unit a  little differently, however, if you take an extra few seconds to verify it's properly seated (I found installing it by pulling the relesase button worked best) you won't have the issue with it falling out."
5.0,"Works great with my Nexus Player.  No configuration needed, just plug it in and go.  Throughput is fine (I haven't measured it).  My main problem with the Nexus Player is the lack of an Ethernet port, and this solves that easily."
5.0,"Whatever others say about Amazon going their own road in the Android market, the FireOS 4.5 is a well done operating system.  Somethings were lost from the old HD, such as the video player remembering where you stopped in a video.  But so much more was gained like a better photo and video player, a better camera app, integration with Amazon Drive, better control over your Amazon account, and so on.  Also, the Amazon app store, while it will never reach the heights that the Google Play Store has made, continues to be a stronger and stronger choice for finding the apps you know and love.  I do hope they can work out whatever issue it was that ticked off Mozilla so I can stop sideloading Firefox.  I mean, Silk is nice, but it's no Firefox."
5.0,"This product did establish a new WiFi network, but as it is more centrally located in this house than the router, my mission was accomplished of having broader coverage. Setup was relatively easy. I would purchase Amped wireless products again - for sure."
5.0,This is the first screen protector that I applied that didn't leave any bubbles behind. The instructions were clear and precise allowing for a perfect application. You can't tell that there's a screen protector applied.
5.0,Great case. Fits well enough for $10.00. Don't really like the keyboard cover but it was included so no harm there!
5.0,"I purchased this product using my wife's Prime account(can't share due to her having a student account). I must say, I think this is the best Ipad case I have had so far. It is very well built, very convenient, and has worked flawlessly so far. The buttons have a nice feel to them, and connecting the case to the Ipad is very easy. I particularly like that the case is light, and still maintains a slim profile."
5.0,nothing is wrong
5.0,"This case is perfect for my HP Pavilion 17.3&#34; laptop. It isn't bulky at all. My laptop is enclosed in my Case Logic LAPS-117 17 - 17.3 laptop sleeve and the laptop with sleeve fits into this Case with room to fit your other essentials. And for the price, this is perfect. I really do love it."
5.0,This sleeve is perfect for the New MacBook Pro 13&#34;! It fits snug and doesn't slide around.  The price to this is terrific and is well made.  The padding is nice and thick too.
5.0,Perfect. Delivered as promised.

5.0,"Excellent memory card, what more can I say.  Worked as intended from the package directly into my digital video camera for recording video.  Love the speed, too."
5.0,"Cloned a 350GB, 7200 RPM laptop hard drive to a 1TB Seagate Hybrid SSDHD in slightly less than an hour.<br />Ran the software right from the enclosed CD.<br />I was able to seamlessly swap the new hard drive for the old afterwards and the system fired right back up.<br />This was done to upgrade the hard drive for a Dell i7 laptop running Windows 8 with 8GB of RAM.<br />Simplest and quickest cloning product I have used thus far."
5.0,"I just got windows 10, so finally had a reason to use a microphone for other than gaming for which I can use my headset's mic. I just like telling Cortana things to do, mic picks up sound pretty well."
5.0,I did not receive micro-USB power cable with the JETech bluetooth keyboard.
5.0,"Great computer.  Pricey, but top notch."
5.0,Product works perfectly.
5.0,"I like the cool sound it makes when your computer starts up.  This mouse has stood the test of time, nearly 4 years after I bought it, still works flawlessly.  I like the length of the cord and the fact that it's fabric wrapped makes it really tough yet flexible."
5.0,fits right out of the box.  perfect protection.

5.0,Very nice and easy to use.

5.0,"I've had this system for about six months now. Very pleased. Not a concert hall system, but an excellent sound for viewing movies and listening to music in the average size room. Full and rich, much better than the stock Bose wave system for a lot less money."
