2.0,tinny weak sound
2.0,"I bought several of these in Oct,2013 and last March one began to fail. I quickly ordered a new one and not five months later it has begun to fail. Last time it wouldn't hold a higher RPM and quite rotating soon after that. I'm ordering another option quickly anticipating the same time line."
2.0,on the corner it says Mosiso in ugly letters. It makes it seam cheap. Was excited about this purchase and now I don't think I'll ever use it.
2.0,"Worked well for a while, but the pin broke after only a few months.  Not very good quality."
2.0,"It is as described, WIn8 mini pc. However, you need to uninstall a security program and delete a user account to be safe. Also the biggest fault after an hour or so of streaming HD media it begins to overheat then you get clipping. I will try a wireless usb adapter to see if that helps but may not. I'd recommend spending more and get one without a metal housing like this. Spend the extra $50-100 it will be worth it. Also the plugs on this are mini to full size -- for example the HDMI connector. It comes with cables but they are not that secure & could easily be broken on the pc side. Again spend a little more and get a nicer PC that will be more durable.<br /><br />I have tried a heat sink on top of the pc but it doesn't help much. Hilarious the heat sink looks like a monster on this little pc."
2.0,"Too thick for the fire phone. When I take the phone from my ear while on a call, the screen stays black. I returned it. However, I do use one on my Fire hdx and it works great!"
2.0,Did not work for us.  My husband workers in the IT field and said this product is junk.
2.0,Expected a more substantial fabric. Thought the bag would stand independently.
2.0,"This mouse is brand new and already malfunctioning. It works great at first, but if I walk away from my computer for a few minutes and then come back, the mouse doesn't work anymore! I have to turn it off and on again to get it to work. SO ANNOYING and disruptive."
2.0,One just broke after a day of use. So don't think the quality of this product is very high and would not recommend it!
2.0,Corners cracked within 3 months of light use.  It was been retired to the local recycling center...
2.0,The mouse portion is hard to use and jumps a bit.
2.0,"I bought this case to protect my surface pro. I had it for maybe, two or three weeks, and the surface pro is already on it's way back to Microsoft (costing me $350 to repair) becuase the screen is shattered.  Now, I did trip in a parking garage. I'm also 5 foot tall. My surface pro was inside this case, inside a bag on my shoulder, that also contained my cell phone, my ipad, and my ipod. The only item that was damaged was the surface pro. To say I'm a bit dissatisfied with the amount of &#34;protection&#34; it provides, is an understatement.  The most sensitive area on a tablet or electronic with a screen is the corner. It's the only part that isn't protected at all.  If you are using the case just for looks, it does it's job. If you're using the case to actually protect your surface pro, I wouldn't spend a dime on it."
2.0,"At first, it worked great.  The long cables were nice, as was the ability to hide it away under the desk and have the switch on my keyboard tray.<br /><br />Now, a month and a half later, the toggle switch no longer works correctly.  Half of the time it sticks down and nothing happens, a quarter of the time it doesn't register a click, and a quarter of the time it actually switches.  I use it multiple times per day, but I would have hoped for more than 45 days of reliability."
2.0,I could not make this bootable. Wanted it for Linux.
2.0,I received that tablet pretty fast. But once I start and put 1 app on it  it went down hill after that. This is after a full day of charging it. The touch keypad was to sensitive. It would jump from one page to another as soon as I started it. It would open apps with out even touching the screen. It would even turn on and off over and over again all day long without even touching it.
2.0,"Quality isn't even close to OEM: the keys are loose and don't feel normal when pressed ( as if a proper amount of resistance and rebound isn't present) and easily pop off, the board doesn't seat correctly in the laptop, and the key lights show through the edges of the keys rather than just the proper spot on the key (like OEM). I'm willing to change the review if the replacement is better."
2.0,It fit my keyboard is expected although it is difficult to keep it in place at times
2.0,"colors not as vibrant as they appear in photo, a bit large for a true14 inch."
2.0,"Update 3-31-16: During a rebuild process. I decided to stream line all the runs and fix some short comings from the previous build. The new build would require me to have some perfectly straight runs out of the rads and at this point is when it come to my attention that the ports weren't straight. This made impossible to run little straight runs since the fittings would be in a obvious angle destroying the aesthetics of the build. I contacted XSPC about the issue in which I received the reply that it is normal for the ports to not be straight and that I was s@#$ out of luck &#34;basically&#34;. So after some research I come to the decision of trying to forcefully bend the ports straight. A method not recommended since it can destroy the rad if not done right. Did some re-planning and decided I would only do that to one port which thankfully I was lucky to be able to do it without breaking the darn thing. Overall with this garbage of a experience I went from a XSPC fan boy to a full on hater. And next time around when I decide to redo my loop I will replace everything and will look towards other brands. And on top of that I will make sure to test very carefully radiator ports and other aspects and if any imperfections are found I will immediately return it to take advantage of return policies from places like Amazon instead of getting a stick up the A@@ from companies that do not respect the customer's warranties. It was a five star review but now it goes down to two... because it still performs okay, and looks good but if support is non existent and warranties are trash then there is nothing more to the products offered by this company.<br /><br />My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on asthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I dont care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recomend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture."
2.0,"the kindle seems alright, but customer service at Amazon made getting this a hellish nightmare.<br />The first one they sent was broken in the back they sent was the wrong color replacement.<br /><br />trying to get this fixed was so terrible.<br /><br />First they make finding customer service contact on the website as difficult as possible.<br /><br />I sent an email about getting the wrong color and was told I had to call or chat, so I started a chat and the first time was transferred to a kindle specialist who promptly disconnected me with a send an email about your concern message. So I started a chat again and was transferred to four (4) different &#34;specialists&#34; who couldn't help and then finally told me they can't access my account but I had to call. So they called me.<br /><br />The operator barley spoke English and couldn't understand what my issue was for a few minutes. Finally he transferred me as well. So then I got a &#34;Kindle Tech Specialist&#34; or something like that.  who did have a better use of American English than his peers. After feeling like he understood what I was looking for he put me on hold for about fifteen (15) minutes.<br /><br />Then some more holding. After thirty one (31) minutes on the phone they finally got it set up so I would get the correct color.<br /><br />I did question if the article about working at amazon being terrible was just over exaggerating, but seeing how hard they work to make customer service support terrible I can believe they don't take care of employees very well."
2.0,"This mouse was ok for a while, but now is already broken.  I think it also took too much pressure to click the right and left buttons. It was ok, and the concept was good, but still has a long way to go. Not satisfied."
2.0,"Lagged like crazy, I couldn't log into the simplest of apps (gmail, facebook, weather) without having to restart - and I have great wireless.  I ended up returning it because it wouldn't scroll for spreadsheets and I bought it for work. I would recommend spending a few extra dollars."
2.0,get what you pay for! sound is good but mic barley works
2.0,"If you think this listing seems too good to be true, you are correct. Samsung does not make this drive. They do not even make this style. What you have here is a generic USB flash drive stamped with the Samsung name and packaged up in an equally counterfeit package.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives are invariably fake-capacity drives - low capacity drives hacked to make them appear to have a much higher capacity.<br /><br />FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br/>Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information."
2.0,"Overpriced. Didn't work with my computers boot cycle, which required additional work each time i started the computer. For the price i paid I am dissatisfied."
2.0,Beautiful bag but after two days of having it the strap busted. Seems like cheap material maybe
2.0,Sadly it just doesn't fit well. It's as if it's a bit too small. So you end up with raised lips around some letters. Stretching it around keys works but only temporarily until you type and the silicon pops off.
2.0,"Not to usefull, have the circuit limitation, not really high speed....Is believe is better MOCA"
2.0,Got this for my grandfather's laptop. It would not charge past 70%. I suppose we recieved a defective one. Be wary of these 3rd party battery replacement. Its a hit or miss.
2.0,"Item was good for a while but all of a sudden my computer started blue screen memory dumping, then restarted itself and said boot disk could not be found. I reinstalled original HDD and the problem went away."
2.0,"I think these mouse pads are very over rated. They slip all over the place on a wooden desk, the surface started fading within months. The most annoying part is the slipping around. I got a mouse pad from work that feels better than the Steel Series QcK pad."
2.0,Have not been able to get it working.
2.0,"The tablet lags. Have to frequently restart. Applications get stuck. Still on Kit-kat. Updates come once a blue moon, wonder if there is a Dell dev team at all. Interface not customizeable. Bloatware not uninstallable. Camera is unusable, takes a good 3 seconds to capture a pic after click event.<br />Like the sleek design and HW solid build quality."
2.0,The drive is fast and has lots of space.  The problem is the drive is LOUD!  If you are planning to use this drive in a computer that you sit beside then go with a different model.  Since Seagate and Western Digital no longer put acoustic management in their drives (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_acoustic_management) this may be a reason to go to an SSD despite the cost.
2.0,Used it once and the plastic holder for the iPad broke. Won't buy again.  I'll try something else.
2.0,Very unhappy about not being able to order without ads and 16gb in the colors of my choice also the parental controls are a joke! You can't even lock the kids out of the settings! Really? It still pops up with store suggestions even though they can't 'buy' them. I am really disappointed. (& we bought 3!)
2.0,Returning it due to chip in the screen by the home button hole.
2.0,"The previous reviewers let me down on this one..  .Poor construction. Stand is not adjustable in any way, and is low and angled forward. It also slants to one side slightly, really. Very uncomfortable to view, I have it propped up on a large book right now. Picture is just ok, really have to mess with brightness and contrast to get a decent picture. (it's not pre-set out of the box?) The main reason I bought this was the built in speakers for space saving reasons.  I did not expect great sound, but these sound horrible. Like the old-school pc speakers that were built in to computers before they made external speakers; tinny."
2.0,Item stopped working within three days.
2.0,"After a full charge, I only get about 45-50 minutes of use before battery has to be charged again!"
2.0,"This notebook bag does not provide maximum protection because the corners and the bottom of it are NOT covered with the same EVA bubble material as the rest of the main compartment; the corners and the bottom are made of just plain fabric. I wanted a bag that provides full protection everywhere, so I returned this bag, and I bought a different one from another store."
2.0,This item lasted 4 years.  It was used infrequently and never dropped or mishandled.
2.0,"This feels like older technology than the Tab 2 it replaced. Not enough internal memory, the touchscreen is the least accurate, and I've already had to replace the battery."
2.0,It's Bowed in the middle so it annoyingly taps the desk all the time
2.0,"I want to love this keyboard. The touch is just right, the keys are satisfying, and the board offers some sound but is not clicky-clacky. Unfortunately there are some shortcomings. They omitted the Windows Menu key (not the Windows button, that's there). I use the menu key heavily and without it I have to continually move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse. A real productivity stopper.<br /><br />Also, to use the Home/End functions (more keys I use heavily) you have to push a secondary Fn key. I would have been fine had they added a skosh more length on the keyboard to include a few more keys.<br /><br />I want to love this keyboard, but I cannot."
2.0,Quick shipping. Product didn't power my device as stated it would. :(
2.0,The &#34;M&#34; key fell off after three days of light use. The &#34;@&#34; key and &#34;!&#34; keys where transposed. Returned.
2.0,Just didn't fit right. Corners were exposed. My MBP needs the best cover possible.

2.0,"Didnt work after 2 weeks. Clicked twice at times, scrolled the wrong way. bad mouse."
2.0,"I like the case, however it does NOT fit a NeuTab N10 as advertised (neither do the screen protectors that come as a special offer).  The case is too wide and the holes in the back do not line up.  Sad that I had to send it back, because it's cute & seemed to be made well.  It would get 5 stars if it fit my tablet that it advertised to fit."
2.0,not comfortable to use and my mouse (which I ordered with the pad and was a recommendation) doesn't glide well.  I had to go back to traditional mouse pad.
2.0,Hurts your head and ear don't buy
2.0,"The zipper is sticky at one spot and it drives me nuts!  But, for that price it's just fine."
2.0,Advertised to fit 7&#34; tablet but corner straps too loose. However swivel feature is a good design.
2.0,I bought these to replace my old Logitech headset that broke after years of use. This is a poorly designed product. Even with the volume up on my computer and on the headset I still could barely hear anything. Worthless!!

2.0,Bought this for my 5 year old son. Worked ok for the first game he played however within 2 minutes of starting to take pictures the tablet froze up and I could not even turn it off.  The tablet got very hot while waiting for the battery to die then I charged it and seemed like it was fine until he took a picture then the same thing happened!!! Fortunately I was able to return
2.0,"Very bad quality product. It's cheap plastic, with poorly designed interior dimentions for a CD/DVD drive which causes the disks to scrape on the top. It's not worth buying."
2.0,"The glass was pretty flimsy and did not really stick to the screen very well.  The stylus is also pretty hit or miss, and it tends to leave smudge marks."
2.0,the controller performs very well....right up until a few months later when the pc cable inevitably fails to work. it gets so finicky that the slightest movement can cause it to disconnect. poor engineering
2.0,"Bought it and immediately returned. Very slow performance and terrible battery life, less that 2 hours."
2.0,I do like the design of this car but it didn't hold my nook tablet in place at all. It slides out constantly so i won't be able to use it for my nook as an actual holder without fear of it falling out again.
2.0,"The link didn't give me consistent WIFI connection to our server.<br />Then again, it may have been the network. Either way, I use the hard wire for best performance."
2.0,I don't like the size and I am having hard time using as my hand is not working on the screen.
2.0,Not good for the hard drive because it is little bit shaky once installed it. and not good for long run.
2.0,"Clip is not quite as pictured.  Instead of tapering down to the width of the chip, it is wide until almost the tip.  This means on the board i wanted to use it with, it hits another part next to the chip and can't be used.  I have a clip that is shaped like the one pictured on amazon and it works fine.<br />Looks like it should work fine but couldn't test it because it wouldn't fit.<br />Looses 1 star because it doesn't fit for my application.<br />Looses 2 stars because it's not the same as what is pictured."
2.0,"This keyboard suffers from all the wider keys having a very annoying and weird squishy feel to them due to how they're balanced to the switch.  The switch has two squishy springy things on either side that completely ruin anything the mechanical switch was attempting to do.  For the price of this keyboard, that's not acceptable.  I ended up returning it and getting the non backlit version for a lot cheaper and that one does not have the problem at all."
2.0,Replaced my older Asus Transformer Book.  This one has a slightly larger screen.  Very easy to set up and begin using.
2.0,Bought two of these backpacks because they were big and could fit all of my stuff for weekend trips.  The first bag's stitching around the main zipper came undone and then broke rendering the backpack useless.  Then I bought a second and the stitching on the arm let go within the first few months again rendering this bag useless.  I am so frustrated with this backpack as I have spent around $110 on buying this bag twice and both fell apartment on me pretty quickly.
2.0,"After installing it would make the screen jump around like crazy, rendering the tablet useless... have to get another glass now"
2.0,I wanted it for the ability to read SIM cards.  It doesn't read them.  I kept it for the SD card reader capability and the ability to plug in USB attachments.  I'm really disappointed in not being able to read SIMs but I haven't found any good reviews for any product which accomplishes that.
2.0,"Worked great for about a year, but then the vertical tracking went to crap.<br /><br />Didn't matter what PC it was connected to, or what kind of mose pad I used.<br /><br />Even manually cleaning the laser sensors didn't help.<br />  - Which, by the way, was WAY more difficult than it needed to be.  Way to design the sensors so that you can't clean them easily/at all."
2.0,Worked brilliantly for one month. Have not been able to connect to the router for two weeks. Tried everything and now passed the return date.  Not happy!😡😤
2.0,"He says like 250 watt and sounds like a 50 watt, sounds clear and us ok for a pc but hooked to tv is not that impressive, get what you pay for I suppose."
2.0,the 3.0 is not working
2.0,Heavy and prevents thumb print start up. Wish I had considered this purchase more.
2.0,"The mouse itself is excellently designed, save for one major flaw.  In order to use the mouse via wireless, you must use the provided 6' USB cable attached to the base station.  This is means there is no benefit to using this with a laptop when travelling.  I contacted Razer Support and they confirmed there is no option to sync directly to my Razer Blade laptop.<br />The software is great, the mouse feels nice, but it is not portable, not even with their own hardware."
2.0,Did not perform as expected.
2.0,"Protects to a point, but doesn't stay closed very easy due to a poor magnet.  If you can help it don't buy Irulu anyway."
2.0,Good idea but didn't work for long.
2.0,Too wide for my PCU
2.0,Product works with all but windows 2000 OS.  Your system must be XP or later for this to work correctly.
2.0,good price but low quality for music
2.0,"Must contain latex.  Beware.  My fingers went tingly, raw and itchy immediately.  There should be an allergy warning on this!<br /><br />It does seem very protective and it's for my daughter (2 years old), not me.  It will be hard for me to avoid touching it.  Seems very protective and comfortable for little hands.  We'll see if I have to return it : /"
2.0,Felt cheap. I didn't like them and plan on getting some better ones at Staples to use instead.
2.0,"It's okay in looks and ability to snap on (unless you have any bent edges), but does not offer much protection or grip"
2.0,Yes its clear but susceptible to getting scratched easily making it less appealing. I will try the clear rubberized case. Just received it and like it already. We'll see how it stands up to everyday use and abuse.
2.0,was smaller than described
2.0,"I love headsets, for all kinds of reasons, what i hate is their failure points in lack of foresight in daily and heavy use.<br /><br />Sure, turn away from neckbeard criticism, but I'm really sick of having to electrical tape the right speaker on, re-wire my microphone, or replace slip covers or pads for my ears. Oh, and let's not forget the weakness on the cable for mute functions because it's not standard to coil it around itself to prevent it from pulling itself out of the inside soldering on the box. On top of also doing the SAME thing at the USB cable head where the wire comes out the back.<br /><br />Oh, but it's okay, I should be happy you finally addressed microphone wires. *eye rolls* I'm sick of buying these, Seriously. The best thing to happen to headsets was the usb extension cable. Barring that, These little suckers add up over the years. But I guess when you SLEEP in them, &#34;thats the problem&#34;<br /><br />expect a lifespan of variance anywhere from 1-2 months [after you make your first half a dozen stupid mistakes] to about six months to a year.<br /><br />true story."
2.0,didn't work for my Kindle fire
2.0,Ports stopped working so I had to return it. Easy return process!
2.0,"Bought this to use as a wifi extender for my computer.  It appears that it is designed to allow you to break the codes of other wifi systems, something I was not looking for, and not sure if it's even legal to use.  Returning for refund."
2.0,Not working well as disconnects from devices very often and not connecting back.<br />Tried to get replacement but did not get good support.
2.0,The hard case fits great and was in perfect condition. The key board on the other doc not fit very well and it had a tare... Not made well at all.
2.0,"way too small for an adult's hand and i have a small hand. Even for a wireless mouse, this is too small"
2.0,"For me, the chips malfunctioned, causing continuous crashing of all programs. When I removed them and re-installed the original apple chips, all operations ran smoothly again. I purchased the chips because of the great price point, however, if there are any issues and you bring your computer to Apple, it can create issues with your Apple protection plan."
2.0,"Very weak wi-fi signal.  Went from Century Link to Cox, which meant needing a cable-compatible modem.  We had strong wi-fi signal strength with the old modem, but now have almost no signal strength the other side of the house.  I've tried turning the modem in different directions, raised it up, lowered it, to no avail.  Not a happy camper."
2.0,"This was a great keyboard, among my favorites ever (surpassing even the old Saitek satellites) until it just up and quit working one day. It lit up, but I couldn't get a response out of it. It was out of warranty by then... bugger. If it were still here and working, it'd be getting 4 stars. I went the CoolerMaster route when I bought its replacement and, although I don't like THAT keyboard as much, it feels like it'll last a lot longer. Here's hoping..."
2.0,Liked the case but the zipper broke after a couple of months of use.
2.0,Dead in less than 2 years
2.0,"Somewhere along the line I lost the disc INSIDE the dash-cam device! Yes, I had to use the 8GB that came with it as the 32 disappeared inside the camera."
2.0,Can't use the camera when the IPad is in the case.
2.0,"Nice and long, only lasted a few days before they stopped working."
2.0,"Purchased new February 11, 2014 and it is made of quality material.  It travels well and is a safe protective cover for the iPad.  It performed well until this past month when it will no longer hold a charge, not at all.  After charging, when the power switch is turned on it goes out in seconds.  Up to this time it has been a great case to use at the office and at home.  With the keyboard no longer operable, it is no more than a bulky computer case.  I was hoping to get several years of use from it.<br />I have not contacted Kensington concerning this issue."
2.0,"I ended up returning this keyboard because I thought it would also function as a case. It makes mention of magnetic attachments that keep the keyboard snug to the iPad. However, when we received this, it did not attach to the iPad 4. Maybe other models are different, but it was not a suitable case whatsoever. It was a cool keyboard,  so if that's what you're looking for, go nutty and buy it!"
2.0,"i like it because i don't have to worry about updates/crashing on a daily basis.  But i didn't realize at the time this is wi fi ,  it doesn't do anything unless you are connected to the wifi.  there may be a way (offline) but  hasn't worked for me yet.<br />the camera crashes all of the time.<br />but it is quick to start up .  i do love it but i just havent had time to learn all the ins and outs of chromebook."
2.0,"This cover is awesome.  It is sturdy and well made. However, it did not fit my new Samsung 7&#34; tablet (it was way too big).  I am going to have to buy another case."
2.0,"I originally left a very positive review....which still holds for the most part, however I had to remove my iPad from the case, (with which I am always careful) and the plastic holder that the iPad clips into cracked!!!!  It's only a few days old! Seriously??"
2.0,not enough storage for my macbook pro
2.0,Cheap but works!
2.0,"Great capaciry card of 128GB, I would NOT recommend this to anyone who think is fast write, it is not fast write. It took a few hours to copy 2 or 3 movies to it. It is great and reasonable fast to READ but not to write.<br />2) If you copy more than 1 file at the time, it didn’t copy the full data’s and you notced that the data is not in some of the files.<br />If you notice, they have not saying about write time at all!"
2.0,"These speakers are pretty bad. The sound quality is not good at all. I'm considering returning them, but I don't think it's worth the  effort or cost."
2.0,"My normal set of security drivers were misplaced during a recent house move. Needing to replace a Nexus battery before all the boxes can be unpacked, this low-priced seemed worth the risk. While I did replace the battery, it was touch and go at times.<br /><br />The driver heads are dicy during operation, the material is thin and not a perfect head shape. Using the phillips on a particularly tight screw when the driver slipped it became clear that the screwdriver would strip/break/deform ridiculously quick, Breaking tips/bits is always a risk, particularly in this gage range, but these are begging to break.<br /><br />The mount bars ended up being single use. After 5-10 movements the plastic was showing signs of fatigue. One ripped partially by the end of the battle to release the old battery from it's glue. A battle exasperated by the fact that the tip ( the end thins and then has a 120 degree bend )  of the mount bar instantly bent to the pressure exerted easily folding on the natural seam.<br /><br />The paddles were okay, and they'll live to see another operation. I didn't use any of the other tools, but I would expect similar experiences with them.<br />These got the job done although it took 3x as long. The tools really needed a delicate touch and I wasn't trying to have a disassembled phone.<br /><br />If I don't find my missing set I'll be buying a formal replacement, unfortunately these are disposable tools  - and that's just sad. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, these are cheap children's toys. I can't say one star because they did technically do what I needed them to do."
2.0,This product is made of VERY smelly rubber. I had to put it outside. There is no way I can use this at my computer desk.
2.0,"Stopped charging up 2 months after I got it. I like the product - but I can't get anyone to take ownership over an internal hardware issue.  So, instead of 5 stars, only 2. Citimall_TAX FREE免税 Storefront, I'm looking at YOU!"
2.0,"I have one of these , for about a year now ,  why can't they make them so you can change the rechargeable Batteries on your own when they go dead and will not keep a charge anymore???"
2.0,"Does not work with an HP Compaq 6000 Pro. I'm sure it's awesome memory for any other box, but the Compaq rejected it like a baboon heart transplant."
2.0,Bought several. Half quit working within 2 months.
2.0,"This may be a great router.....BUT....cannot use without a modem...and this is not a combo modem and router.  The D7 is a combination, but not the C7.  This is not described in description or by other customers reviews....that I found.  Seems it should be in plan sight as is pretty important info.  Now I am being charged $4 to return, which I do not understand with Amazon Prime."
2.0,"Once product it installed, it works great.  However there are a few issues, which is why I only give it 2 stars.<br /><br />Purchased two and when I first received it, it wouldn't auto connect straight out of the box.  According to our Trendnet technical support call, we had to open both boxes and play with the jumper switches until I found a combination that worked for us.  After a few hours, I finally found a combination that worked.  Was happy it now works, but very unhappy about the amount of time it took to install something that should auto-connect. This brings me to the second issue I don't like about these things.<br /><br />The link lights on these devices are a general link - nothing more.  If ANY connection on EITHER converter is lost, ALL link lights turn off - including on the Ethernet switches.  This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot any type of connection issues.  These should have independent link lights for fiber and Ethernet instead of leaving us guessing where the problem is at.  Even though the pair I have is working great now, it makes me nervous thinking  any future issues we may have with them."
2.0,"i absolutely love this product.  This is the 4th year i am buying this brand.  However, there really is no need to buy new every year since they hold up and quality of product is OUTSTANDING!  i buy new because my 9 year old boy looks forward to choosing the photo on the back for back to school.  the product is extremely well made for a rough and tough boy!  the handle,  zipper and shoulder straps are heavy duty.  The only down fall this year for me is i think the bag got smaller - we have to squeeze his cloth-like lunch bag in with his mandatory 3 ring binder and no room for anything else.  but other than that - i love this bag and will continue to buy year after year.  the price is well worth the hold up of this bag. you will not be disappointed. (however-i suggest they come up with some sort of freshener within the lining of the bag if you have a stinky kid! lol)<br />*****UPDATE  - it is Feb 2016 (i bought this bag in Aug 2015) - so far, the zipper handle broke off, the handle on top came apart from the seams and now the straps on the back at the seams are coming off the back pack.  i'm saddend and shocked to see how this bag is NOT holding up. the previous years the bag was great...now we switched to last years backpack for the remainder of this school year. boo. go back to the original quality!!!"
2.0,I have got two of these both got a crack in the corn and now tablet will not work very sad
2.0,The laptop was great while it worked. After less than a week the screen stopped powering on completely. The internals themselves were fine but the screen just gave up.
2.0,"I like the compact size of the keyboard and mouse, however, both the mouse and keyboard have delay issues. Would not recommend this product!"
2.0,So so
2.0,"Alright I'm going to resubmit this review because I have had time to let it absorb and get used to the function of this piece of equipment. If you have an older computer and you need this type of connectivity, then you are already having problems. PS 2 and a USB connectivity is a very old technology. If you're using a computer and you need to make this switch your already going slower than I would expect and most of these parts can be picked up at garage sales and such. But if you do need to buy one because you're not willing to go and look. This will probably fit your needs easy simple does the job"
2.0,"Despite Crucial's assurances that they &#34;guarantee this memory will work&#34; with my Toshiba L675D, it failed to boot.<br />I went with some other Crucial memory that actually matched the factory specs but was advertised for Macs (against tech support advice).<br />It works fine!<br />Lesson learned:  Don't trust idiot tech support personnel, and Thank you Amazon for your excellent return policy!"
2.0,Did not work as expected. The scroll wheel started to wear out fast and was messing up the right click button. Waste of money.
2.0,"This bag is fantastic looking - gorgeous (I have it in light blue). It's very structured, smart-looking, and the leather is soft. The stitching is high quality. Then why the bad review? It lacks functionality! My bag cannot handle a 15.4&#34; laptop. The shoulder strap falls off continuously. The silver ring it straps on with is held up in a strange way. Basically, it's a clippy hook that falls apart because it's meant to stay together by inserting a circular post into an oval ring. Obviously, a circle slips out of an oval. If it'd been the opposite way around, there wouldn't be a problem. I'm really unhappy about the fact that this bag can't actually be used to tote a laptop, because it's quite lovely otherwise."
2.0,"Very noisy cable. Bought this for my Scarlette 2i2 interface and might as well throw it in the trash. It functions, but useless in terms of recording."
2.0,"This tablet doesnt perform too well. My home screen picture changes size, from my settings to a larger picture. Apps that I have through google play dont function correctly (almost open, the closes up completey). The previous owner's picture come back after I've deleted them multiple times. I've only had it 6 days."
2.0,"It was good at first, but then the little metal tabs fell out of one side of the case and now the magnetic<br />clasp does not keep the case closed"
2.0,Perfect fit but dies extremely fast. Last for about a hr total. Get what u pay for.
2.0,"Worked good, neat to watch.  Conversation piece, then it died after a month..."
2.0,To small of screen
2.0,too small
2.0,"By far the slowest cables I've purchased to date!!! The only plus about this product is the fact that 6 come in a box. I've been testing All cables for some time now using them with wall chargers, car chargers, portable chargers and these cables are horribly slow. In my opinion there is nothing premium about these cables.<br /><br />I tested these cables for quite some time and gave them a fair shot. Now I'll be moving on and will only use these as a last resort if my other 12 sets of cables ever fail me."
2.0,Great for kid only! To slow for adults.
2.0,"It arrived missing the screen protectors and keyboard cover. It fits alright, but does not clip into place.<br />Not the best case."
2.0,Doesnt correspond with the keys on a mac book air 13inch
2.0,"Looked cheap, thin and and flimsy.  It wouldn't stay closed."
2.0,"It charged just as fast as the basic cable that came with my Galaxy s5 charger, but this one died after like 6 months. All I ever used it for was charging at night or charging while I was sitting on the sofa, so it's not like it experienced a lot of wear and tear. I was hoping a cable this thick and sturdy would have a longer lifespan, so I'm pretty disappointed."
2.0,Too Large
2.0,One of the 3 port sets stopped working after several months.  I also have a problem with my usb keyboard rarely being recognized unless I unplug and plug it back in.  Look elsewhere.
2.0,"Gets dirty, and tough to wash out the particles that get stuck. Other than the maintenance, it does its job - protects the keyboard well."
2.0,It keeps locking up. Has been very frustrating. Very disappointed thus far. I am consulting with Apple support.
2.0,"THE LCD died.  One of the things I enjoyed about this was the cool looking LCD. But, that has since died and this case lost a great deal of it's appeal. Sad as it is. I suppose I'll move on."
2.0,Unfortunately they don't last long. I bought 2 of them. One the wire underneath got worn away and broke. The other the fan broke and no longer works. Not worth the investment!
2.0,Wasn't what I was expecting.
2.0,"Edging border began to fall off after return date ended,so now I am stuck with a broken phone case that I can't return. In the title it says 3 year warranty so I am hoping that Poetic will replace my case."
2.0,"Works, but seems like the glue on the lightning connector end is failing (a week later).  Though it seems like that's not even necessary, just a plastic nameplate..."
2.0,Very slow and very little internal memory
2.0,"The seller was good.<br />The product- the mouse is a little too skinny, and my thumb hurts after using it."
2.0,After a year it started coming a part. Otherwise it was good.
2.0,"I saw and demo-ed one of these in a local electronics store, and wanted one for about a year.  Finally, I decided to pull the trigger and buy one.  I thought it would be &#34;like an enormous iPad&#34; (since it is a touchscreen) that can also go on a stand and be a TV (for streaming videos and the like) and could also be used for Skype lessons.  At the same time that I purchased this Lenovo Horizon 2 27: All in One, my husband purchased a beautiful 27&#34; iMac and made fun of me for wanting the Lenovo.  In addition to the fact that the Lenovo was a touchscreen, the Lenovo was also less than half the price of the iMac and could easily be carried around or rolled around on a cart.  So when both products showed up at the same time, the computers were set up and my kids immediately flocked to the much more fun Lenovo.  That's where the fun ends.  Almost immediately, the &#34;Power On&#34; button on the side of the Lenovo got stuck in the frame of the computer.  No matter what we did (with tweezers, etc.) we couldn't get the button to come out - so the computer was in the constant state of being powered on - in other words, not working at all.  At this point, my kids had used the computer a handful of times, and I had not used it at all - we had had it for a few weeks.  Apparently, the warranty doesn't cover this type of issue (which is considered damage by owner, not a faulty part).  The numerous times I've tried to call Lenovo for help, they couldn't find the Serial Number in their database at all, so I couldn't register the warranty online or by phone.  I had to take the computer into a service center during which I waited in a LONGGGGGGG line on a Saturday during which several customers ended up &#34;going postal&#34; on the numb employees working there - screaming about how long they waited and about how someone calls them and says it's ready and then it's not...  After a couple of hours of waiting, my number was called, and the person helping me said that the stuck &#34;ON&#34; button was not covered under warranty, but they would request that the problem be covered as an exception.  We had zero confidence that the exception would be granted.  We left the the Lenovo, original box and packaging and cord with a strong sense that we'll never see it again - it was like dropping it into a black hole (completely disorganized place).  The couple of tissue paper like forms that they left with us had no details (like that the computer had been left there with the original box and power cord), and I was forced to sign something that says &#34;I hereby acknowledge that the damage was due to my personal negligence...&#34;  It's been several weeks, and after waiting a LONGGGGG time on the phone line when calling the well-kept-secret phone number of the service center, I'm left on hold when someone finally picks up the line and/or I can't get anyone to pick up the line to see what the status is of the computer.  At this point, I'm willing to just pay for someone to pry out the ON button.  My husband keeps giving me this knowing I-told-you-so look.  Drives me crazy when he's right!"
2.0,"1. The ribbon was not included while they claim that they do include one with the keyboard. Luckily, I managed to remove the one from my defective keyboard. Since Dell glues it, it is a very risky operation as it could be damaged in the process of being un-glued<br />2. Please pay very close attention to the picture. If you compare your keys with this keyboard, you will notice some significant differences. For example, the left shift key is narrower and the * key on the numeric pad is replaced by the x key. Since Excel uses the * in the formulas, this can be an issue.<br />3. They say it is brand new, yet, I noticed a paint chip when I un-packed it. Sounds more refurbished than new."
2.0,"It fits the keys, but the outside trim is way too big."
2.0,Like the design and LED lights but key broad dose not work.
2.0,I need to remember that you get what you pay for.
2.0,"having a real hard time with Windows 10 and this device, any help would be great!"
2.0,This is not an OEM replacement. It lacks the white indicator light.
2.0,The bottom part fits perfectly but the top part won't stay.
2.0,The case itself had a brown stain on it when first opened (that won't go away) and when putting it on noticed a crack as if it had happened from someone putting it on their fire multiple times. But other than that no complaints.
2.0,Overall it's probably worth the price but it's very heavy and the laptop restarted instead of shutting down on multiple occasions when I in fact clicked on Shutdown. Hopefully there are no other hardware (?) issues in the future.
2.0,It is hard to read the display because of the light bleeding to other sections of the LCD. The codes don't display propeller and change hundreds of times per second.
2.0,"They don't seem to be as durable as they used to be. At one point, they were my go-to cable manufacturer but I need to shop around now. It still provides a charge but does not fit in snugly and this is only after a few days."
2.0,The word came kink so I have to hold it a certain way to charge my device
2.0,"Likes: WISP function, battery-powered, when it worked.<br /><br />Dislikes: It didn't work most of the time."
2.0,This product has a slight defect which makes it problematic to use as intended.<br /><br />After installing the battery - touchpad on my Acer S3 started behaving strange - it became oversensitive and also the left mouse click stopped working. I could press but there will be no click.<br /><br />I traced the problem to battery pressing against the touchpad. After a few install and uninstalls; I decided to pull out original battery and compare side by side. Turns out there is a thin piece of plastic  on original battery (see attached picture - top is original battery bottom is this battery by battery TEC) which keeps the battery up (by about 1mm) from the touchpad which is missing from this battery. Manufacture should look into this and fix. I tried to fix it by putting electrical tape - it is ugly but for now it seems to improve touchpad behavior.
2.0,not very durable
2.0,"After reading 100's of positive reviews from several different sites, I felt fairly comfortable ordering the KingPad K90. It arrived on time, perfect condition and was well protected for shipping. It fired right up and then the disappointments started. The colors on the screen were vibrant but the white and black was so washed out I could barely see it. I decided to download a few App's from the Play Store after connecting to my Wi-Fi. This is the real problem. It took almost 3 minutes to download a 2 Meg program. It took almost as long to open it. I tried 4 more applications with similar results or worst. Once the program's are open, the performance &#34;Facebook &#34; is mildly better but forget trying to multi-task or run a video game with graphics.<br /><br />I really wanted this product to work but the performance is so horrible I don't think I would ever use it out complete frustration.<br /><br />I hope that I got a lemon but this for sure was not worth expedited shipping."
2.0,Thought I was getting the tripod and mount.
2.0,It's a good pen works on most touch device but MAJOR LIMITATION IS LACK OF PALM REJECTION. IT MEANS THAT ONE HAS TO WRITE KEEPING HAND IN AIR & MUST NOT TOUCH THE SCREEN
2.0,Didn't work for me. Tried everything that was said and could get anything to clone. Would have given it one star but it does hold 2 hard drives and they do work. They just don't clone. Even had to buy a bigger hard drive because the clone has to be bigger then the drive being cloned. Don't waste you money. If you need to clone I think you have to spend a little more for the really good set ups.
2.0,"I purchased 4 of these laptops for the office.<br /><br />The keyboard layout uses chicklet style keys. These keys are small and spaced out. After many years of using more traditional keyboards, I found it very hard to type without constantly missing keys and having to retype my words. This significantly slowed me down on my work. I recommend using a wireless mouse.<br /><br />The trackpad I also found to be a bit on the small side. As well as the buttons for the track pad. I found it difficult to use multi-touch. It rarely recognized my commands like, scroll, pinch and zoom, etc. Again, using this trackpad for your mouse is a hassle. Get a wireless mouse.<br /><br />The display is big, but brightness lacks a bit. Not very good in very bright environments.<br /><br />Design, looks good in the pictures on the site. But in person this laptop looks plasticy and cheap.<br /><br />Lastly, the specs are great on paper but in use the laptop constantly hung on me while trying to install programs and getting it setup for office use. I was installing Microsoft Office and some pdf programs. Manufacturer responded to me and said possibly the computer was doing updates in the background. I suppose that's possible since I had just turned it on.<br /><br />I did like the size of the power adapter. It's very small.<br /><br />Overall not a terrible or unusable computer, specially considering the price. But everyone else raved about it so I wanted to share some faults I found with it so you can make your own decision."
2.0,"The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB. See &#34;http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTSE9H_us.pdf&#34; for Kingston DTSE9 product specifications and check for yourself.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.

2.0,I have had to tape the back because it is loose and ends up popping out the plug ins. I guess you get what you pay for. :(
2.0,"I knew it was cheap but I thought I would give it a try.  The keyboard works fine, but its not bluetooth, it plugs in and that connector sticking out of a tablet is begging to get damaged.  Still, I would have used it but it just could not securely hold the 7&#34; Polaroid tablet.  It constantly slipped out and fell right from the case.<br /><br />Beyond that, the case has a nice color feel.  Wish it would have worked for the tablet.  I bought a different one from Best Buy (much more expensive) which works perfect and has a rechargeable bluetooth keyboard.  Holds the tablet perfectly."

The Kindle is limited by Amazon and purposely doesn't allow downloads of apps that aren't on Amazon market place.  This tablet has soooo many problems !! AS in :  slow connection to internet, NO connection to internet possible much of the time, slow or no connection to videos, games, etc. NO support!!! Just reading other problems from other owners.  So, do yourself a huge favor and buy ANYTHING ELSE!!!  Mine was a gift from my well-meaning son."

Would freeze in Netflix all the time even after many updates."
2.0,"Backblaze shows this as the drive with the highest cumulative failure rate in their regularly-published statistics, and I have to say that my experience bears this out.  I've bought a total of 3 of these on Amazon (one two years ago, the other two under a year ago).  The oldest failed after just over a year, and was replaced under warranty.  The replacement drive failed today, not even a year later (and no longer under warranty).  50% isn't a great average, especially considering that the other two are not yet a year old.<br /><br />I run them in a RAID so this is mainly an exercise in frustration.  However, just the effort required to RMA the things has to be factored in, as well as the return mailing expense.<br /><br />I would never run of these as a standard desktop drive outside of a RAID, even with daily backups.  The pain factor would be enormous.<br /><br />I still gave it 2 stars.  The fact is that there aren't a lot of 3TB 7200 RPM drives out there, and these are the cheapest of them by a significant margin.  If you don't mind playing musical drives, they may still be a good buy."

But there are little pieces of plastic that connect the bottom plastic to the side plastic on the edge (the edges on the sides at the bottom of the computer aren't fully covered, they have little hold the cover together). One of those broke and it was like a tiny needle that scratched my lap pretty bad."

2.0,I installed it myself and it wasn't as hard as some comments implied. The problem is that battery life is as bad with this battery as it is with the two-year old original battery. It lasts for up to 6-8 hours with very light usage. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,The tabs break off very easily.  I had a 20% failure rate on my home patch panel.  Spend a little more for better quality.  It's not worth the hassle.

2.0,"Worked for about 10 months.  Then it started working only intermittently, causing my laptop to indicate it had been uplugged and plugged in.  I thought maybe the connector wasn't plugging in properly, but my other chargers worked fine.  Now it mostly doesn't work and when it does the plug gets very hot.  Probably there's a bad connection between the wire and the connector inside the plug that's getting worse."
2.0,"I could not get the mouse to work on several computers. The packaging indicated it was from 2011, so this is an older product. I have computers with the right Windows Logo and it didn't work on them. HP's support number was not familiar with the product and basically said they couldn't help unless I tried it with an HP computer! Too bad as I would like a wireless mouse with no dongle for my non-Bluetooth computers. Update: I found an HP 6530b laptop that just happened to need a clean install of Windows 7 and I installed this mouse first thing, even before Windows Updates. It works fine on this computer most of the time, however is slow to connect during startup as it's dependent on the Wi-Fi loading and connecting during boot."

2.0,"I picked up a G430 gaming headset, to replace my G930's that broke when I moved to another state. The Store (Best Buy) didn't stock them, so I thought I would try the 430's. The price was reasonable ($80) and I have used Logitech gaming products for quite a while now (G510S Keyboard and G502 Mouse) and have enjoyed them. The G930 Headset was terrific; wish I could say the same thing about the G430. First off the bat, the sound only emanates out of the left speaker, even though stereo and surround sound is activated (the 930's did this perfectly). Next, when I tried to set up the software from Logitech's support site, it was like no go. Nothing happened, except that the firmware was not affected. Also, the sound quality is not up to par. I use TeamSpeak to communicate with my gaming compadres when we play or raid. I can barely hear them talking, even though the sound control is turned all the way up. The Mic seems to work ok.<br />My bottom line is, I am ditching the G430's for another Headset."
2.0,"Okay, it took about a week from order to mailbox. I had no problem with it fitting my laptop. So, far it works as it should in that it charges to a full 100%. I'm going to check and see just how long the charge holds for and will update at the end of month #1. So, far no regrets.  It's been a few months - Okay, so I'm getting less than 2 hrs on a full charge. It's more like 1 hr 30...give or take a few mins extra.  You may get 2 hrs if you set the setting on your laptop just right, but I don't see anyone getting 3 hrs. UPDATE - It's been almost a year and I'm getting the dreaded, &#34;Low battery&#34; warning at startup telling to replace the battery. I feel like getting a year out of the  battery just isn't enough...dropping this down a star.   UPDATE 2 - 08/25/2016  I didn't think I'd get anywhere, but contacted seller and asked if the battery carried a warranty. I was told it did and was for one year. They sent me a new battery. I'll update once I've gotten some use out of it. So, for now the rating stays.  UPDATE 3 - 11/15/2016  A days ago, while starting my laptop, I got the dreaded &#34;Replace battery&#34; warning AGAIN. I've tried to calibrate the battery, but still the same issue. This battery lasted less than 3 months. The price of said battery seems to have gone a bit since I first bought it. While the battery seems fine with the A/C charger plugged in, still the point is be able to run the laptop with just battery power. I get 30 mins at best on &#34;Balance setting.&#34; I'd skip buying this battery for your laptop. The only good experience with this product is the co that sold me said battery did send me a replacement, but when the battery last such a short time, it's uneventful experience."

Now it's sitting on my desk as a fairly unattractive hub, not what I had in mind. Would be great if it worked as advertised, but it doesn't."
2.0,"It works great, except that each time the power goes off or 'blinks' - it must be manually re-connected to the main router!"
2.0,"It didn't meet the requirements of my note pad,"
2.0,Cheap material
2.0,"I really liked the keyboard and mouse but within a few months the mouse started acting weird. It would not track accurately, with the cursor jumping on the screen quite frequently, and now its almost unusable. I still use the keyboard. Its too bad since I had started to like the smooth scroll wheel."
2.0,product did not work. Could not connect to configure.
2.0,"Sorry Folks!  Way too big, bulky, and hot to wear.  Good sound, though."
2.0,does not stand up well
2.0,"I really didn't want to give this thing a bad review.<br /><br />If you're buying this keyboard for the pretty colors, then it's the right keyboard for you.  The colors, patterns, key reactions and brightness are all fully customizeable for all keys, groups of keys or even the individual key itself.  It color cycles.  It pulses.  It does 'the wave'.  You can program it to do just about anything.  Now, making a cool color combination can be a little tedious, but if you're determined and creative you can make your keyboard flash like a disco.  Sometimes it doesn’t load the right profile, or it forgets what profile was loaded and defaults to something you didn’t want.  In fact, as I type this, Razer Synapse has stopped working, and that’s the interface that lets you control the pretty colors.  But when it does work, the colors are really amazing.<br /><br />But unfortunately, you may have to use this keyboard for typing and/or gaming, and that's where it falls short.  The keys are no more or less comfortable than other keyboards.  The clicks are a little loud but not noisome (if you think you’ll be bothered by the clicking noise I encourage you to find one in a store somewhere and hear for yourself).  It does function as advertised.<br /><br />Sometimes a key will get stuck.  If you're lucky, only thissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss will happen.  But sometimes the BACKSPACE key gets stuck, and you get to watch just how quickly the cursor deletes every word you just wrote.  And sometimes it's an arrow key, and instead of turning your video game spaceship to aim at the enemy spaceships, you just start spinning uncontrollably.  This to me is a fatal flaw.  This should not occur on a keyboard I bought just a few months ago.  I don't abuse this keyboard, I don't press the keys very hard and all my previous keyboards worked fine for years and years.<br /><br />Another irritating feature is that while the letters and numbers are backlit, the shift characters are NOT.  So at night you can look down and see 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but you have to kind of think about which one is !, @, #, $ or %.  Same with : &#34; &#60; &#62; ? { } | _ and +.  This may seem minor and I kind of knew it when I purchased it, but I had no idea how much that would annoy me.<br /><br />There is an indicator to see if caps lock, num lock and scroll lock are on, but they're so dim you'll never notice them.  You can see them if you look at the keyboard from directly above, but if you sit and type like a normal person they will be invisible to you.<br /><br />Also, the keys are not backlit when your computer is booting up, so don’t use a complicated password on your PC or you’ll need a flashlight to enter it.<br /><br />They were kind enough to throw in a USB port and some mic/headphone hookups, but there are no dedicated media buttons.  I really miss having those buttons on my keyboard.  It was nice to just be able to hit 'mute' and take a phone call without making the recipient listen to the Clash at full volume.<br /><br />So I give it one star for being a functioning keyboarddddddddd (sorry) and one more star for all the pretty colors.  But Razer, next time you make a gaming keyboard I would really appreciate one that doesn't have sticky keys, and it wouldn't kill you to make the # 's light up like all the other characters."
2.0,"I have had issues getting this to work with my system. I am not sure what is going on, but it is slow and sluggish."
2.0,"I bought this because I needed an Android device for development.  However, after unboxing, configuring, and installing some apps on this device, I really don't think I'll be using it much.  I have a year and a half old iPad mini with Retina Display, and I've already noticed several things about this device that annoy me in comparison to the iPad.  First, the display quality on this is terrible.  Aside from the low resolution, it looks like everything is grainy and over-sharpened - even the default wallpaper. Contrast on edges look artificially high.  It gets really hot while charging, using the provided wall wart.  It arrived 97% charged, but even just charging that last 3%, it was slightly uncomfortable to hold and use while charging.  The way the keyboard scales to the screen dimensions make it clunky and difficult to use.  If you plan do do a lot of typing with this device, definitely get a Bluetooth keyboard.  It also doesn't identify itself to Google properly.  I got an email from Google saying that I signed into my account with a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10.  And it was set to a Chinese time zone when I received it.  Other than that, it's slower to boot than the iPad, makes settings hard to find (I had to dig for a while to figure out how to check for updates), and the whole concept of not all apps being displayed on the homescreen / having to tap something special to view what's installed is really weird coming from iOS.  It didn't detect the settings properly for my Exchange account.  So yeah, a lot of disappointments so far, but what it has going for it is that it works, it runs Android, and it's inexpensive.  But it in no way even comes close to competing with even the least expensive previous model of Apple equipment."
2.0,"This mouse is an extremely cheap mouse. It has no heft to it, it feels like a plastic box, and it would break very easily.<br /><br />It works fine, and the range is accurate.<br /><br />I'm definitely getting a mouse that is much more expensive than this in the future."
2.0,battery life sucks
2.0,Good product but the wide is shorth to computer's of 11.6&#34;
2.0,I used it with my mac. The sound was OK but there is very huge lag if you are playing a video and displaying it in a tv.
2.0,"I got an HDX for xmas and I didn't even use my kindle for a year and it has many charging issues.  Sometimes, I plug it in over night and it never charges."
2.0,The folio is awesome but for some reason my keyboard is not being recognized at all. I followed the instructions that were given with the keyboard and friend of mine ordered and it connected with no problem
2.0,"worked the 1st time, second time it wouldn't charge my tablet."
2.0,"REQUIRES 32 bit windows xp or 7 to set up. vonets support isnt the best either, if i could, id remote into it over ip and be done, but it doesnt like that either...."
2.0,The fan is louder than my previous one. Not going to use it
2.0,"They keys are good and it has a solid weighty feel, but the touch pad is almost unusable."
2.0,Returned it for a ASUS 100T
2.0,"This tablet case is great unti it breaks. My third one just broke. The plastic corners that hold the tablet in are either too thin or made of cheap stuff. They invariably crack and the tablet starts to slip out of the case until a second one cracks a well. My tablet leads a cushy life. Never used by children or thrown around. It just sits on my couch, in my lap or on the end table. I won't buy another Fintie. Im tired of giving them 25  bucks every six months."
2.0,It was good for a week till the rubber  starting falling off in big strips
2.0,Did not fit some of my 30 pin cables.
2.0,Short time to use after charged fully. consider returning.
2.0,Fingerprints and it's hard to clean
2.0,"Worked fine for one week then one of the units got burned, ie, smell electrical burn and its LAN side did not work any more!!"
2.0,"Within 2.5 months of casual and careful daily use, the right earpiece is starting to rattle, and the tops of the pads are worn to the point that the hard inner part rubs painfully on my ear during use. Volume has never been loud enough to do any damage to the headset."
2.0,"It's only been around a month since I gave these as a present to my roommate and one side is already significantly weaker than the other. I regret buying from here, fully knowing that it had little reviews. She does not even use these that often, yet the right side is already malfunctioning. I would NOT buy these as a gift again."
2.0,Ended up unusable because when zoomed to a person it's worse than my laptops cam.
2.0,"I bought this monitor because it has multiple inputs and not that expensive.  I use it as a computer monitor and also connect it to my TV cable box with an HDMI cable. The screen is just okay at best.  Have tried numerous settings, but the screen looks washed out -- colors are not bright at all.  One problem with my monitor is it switches inputs when my computer shuts off the monitor (mine is set to turn off monitor 10 minutes after I quit using it).  The monitor switches from HDMI input 1 to HDMI input 2 .  I then have to manually select HDMI 1 when I want to use the computer -- annoying.  There are no keystrokes to do this -- you have to use the input button on the monitor.  For the above reasons I would not purchase this monitor again."
2.0,"It's hard to find skins that fit so many different laptops. After trimming this one to the desired size, the corners tend to peel."
2.0,iPhone often says that the cord is not compatible and will not charge.
2.0,Worked great at first.. Each last about a month or less. Definitely not a good long term investment.
2.0,"I loved the color and texture, but sadly it did not fit. This case will not fit a macbook with a hard case over it."
2.0,"After about a month the case had cracked on the corners and had other places where cracks were visible.  It looks good, but the quality is not what I had hoped for."
2.0,The case is not long lasting. After a month using it the case starting to break on the sides .
2.0,"Worked fine for about a month and now the keys are not responding well, if at all. Reinstalled and checked the cable but it didn't help. I'll spend a bit more on the next one."
2.0,Those metal clasps in the corners will fall off in a week. Guaranteed.
2.0,Does not work on Apple laptops!
2.0,I guess it technically does hold a 17 in. laptop but not comfortably by any means. It's so tight I really would say that it didn't. Only reason I didn't send it back was because we were in the middle of moving and I had other things to worry about.
2.0,"I've always liked gear head equipment but I think the shipping and handling of this was not good enough. almost all of them that I ordered (I ordered 10 of them) are cracked on the bottom and one of them, the screen on the top was bent up pretty bad."
2.0,"I didn't expect much sucking power from a cheap, USB-powered vac, so I was surprised that this failed to meet even those low expectations. Neither of the attachments stays connected to the vac while in use—the brush attachment in particular falls off at the slightest touch, which defeats the entire purpose of having a brush.<br /><br />It is incredibly loud for such a small device, and doesn't seem to suck up more than the most minute dust particles. The lack of vacuuming power combined with attachments that don't stay one make it virtually useless as anything more than a noisemaker."
2.0,Does not work on windows 10
2.0,difficult to program.. not at all user friendly.
2.0,"device didn't work with Mac USB3. I think , I just got unlucky with defective device."
2.0,"Horrible range, have to reset router multiple times, I ended up getting rid of it for an airport extreme refurbished."
2.0,The mouse pad i received was not like the picture of the product. The picture is much much darker and is not as colorful as the one shown. Also the right side & bottom of the graphic is cut off as if it was enlarged before printing so my pad doesn't have the complete picture as shown on it. I did not get the product as advertised. Currently i'm not happy with this purchase.
2.0,"The antenna does extend the range of your wifi, but it isn't anywhere near 1/2 mile as advertised... I returned mine."
2.0,This item did NOT perform as well as I had hoped it would. Kept dropping bandwidth for some  reason. I would not buy this again.
2.0,It's not a bad key board. But when your playing games for me I like have to really push down on the keys for them to work.  I means it's not a bad key board. But I would buy a different one if I could.
2.0,"The case is cracking everywhere and all 4 of the corners have chipped off. I am extremely careful with my macbook, as I bought it with my own money. So I know that it isn't from me throwing it around or anything. I would not repurchase."
2.0,it doesn't stand up when in the position as seen in the pix.
2.0,"It was nice when it came out of the box, but after a few dozen uses the cover is falling apart. The outside &#34;seams&#34; are coming off and the front is peeling -- something I wouldn't have expected from what is surely light use."
2.0,"The device started out terrific!!!  Used it with 3 different laptops.  Then, all of a sudden it stopped working at month 9....  For $15 I guess I shouldn't expect more.  Now I have to purchase another device, I think I'll pay a bit more for a product that will last at least a year!!!!"
2.0,"Constant warnings that device is not charging or is not compatible or will not synch to my laptop.  Takes 3x as long, but will charge eventually to 100%. Nice how long they are tho....however I suspect that's the problem ever since I learned that extension cords can drop power over distance"
2.0,"Not as good as expected.  The app works great when it works.  Most of the time, it will not show the router.  And, if you update the app, it let you make changes to the router until you update the firmware on the router.  Very annoying.<br /><br />The range is decent, but not spectacular."
2.0,"Purchased this little bugger six months ago as a quick and cheap alternative, figuring it would be bare bones. It's lightweight and reliable except for the touchpad which can get very buggy. On that alone I would not purchase it again.  Also just learned that it doesn't have large enough capacity to install  Windows 10. I do use it pretty much like I would use a Chrome Book and would probably opt for that, though not for a cheap model, if I were doing it again."
2.0,"Everytime I insert this into my laptop, it appears to disable my wifi somehow. I'm unable to connect to my internet while I'm using this battery. When I remove it, my wifi works again. It's very strange."
2.0,"After just a couple of months of having this backpack, the top handle and zipper tore.  When I tried to contact Belkin for an exchange, the experience was long and weirdly confusing and ultimately, I did not get an exchange.  Sorely disappointing because the slim design is nice and I would have liked this to last longer than it did."
2.0,"It works sorta.  My speed drops a lot versus my 802.11B USB adapter... i went back to my old one, and this one sits in a little baggie as a back-up.  I wasn't impressed at all.  I mean you get what you pay for, clearly.<br />And for the record, my WiFi router is Line-Of-Sight 15 feet from the computer.. zero obstructions.<br /><br />Spend a little more and get something quality."
2.0,"Keyboard no longer functions correctly after 5 months of use.  It's locked on to &#34;caps lock&#34; and some of the keys do not register.  It still lights up but not being able to type makes this keyboard useless.  However, the company flexbrains offered to send me a mouse of equal value it seems.  They don't have this keyboard in stock anymore for replacement so It was either I ship them the broken keyboard on my expense (they didn't offer shipping or anything so I assume it would've been on my expense) or they send me a new mouse.  My mother's mouse is broken so good timing, I went for the mouse. Hope it works well."
2.0,Barely extended our range.
2.0,"The case is nice enough quality.  However, it does NOT auto sleep/wake the screen like it claims it would.  Just an extra button push, but still disappointing to receive something not as advertised."
2.0,"On my 2nd unit and originally reviewed the keyboard positively, even tho'  I bought the second one after the hinge on the first froze up after a year.  Now on my second unit and...same thing.  Admittedly after 2 yrs this time, but it's disappointing to through away a working keyboard because of a failing in their hinge engineering (no, oil etc. doesn't work).  Guess I'll spend a bit more for quality engineering on the hinge. Consider this issue if you want more than a year or two of normal use."
2.0,"did not fit at all,so sending back"
2.0,"Do yourself a favor and get a r9 390. Better performance in upcoming DX12 games, and only has 3.5 gb VRAM. Very dissapointed in Nvidia for the false advertising."
2.0,"I purchased this case hoping that it would be as the previous reviewers described it. However, it does not securely fit my 15 inch MacBook Pro. It is loose on one side and that is very frustrating. The keyboard cover is not lined up properly. The letters and numbers are not even in the middle of the squares. I will be returning this case and I will not recommend this product in the future."
2.0,Pros: Applied easily to device.<br /><br />Cons: Not anti-finger print.<br /><br />Amazon shows this product when searching for tempered glass screen protectors.  This is NOT tempered glass
2.0,"I have bought this product since it had large number of positive feedbacks. Well, it didn't meet my expectations,  I have Lenovo Yoga 2 10 inch. well, the screen protector was just too big. I had to cut from all sides (large and small) plus it had an extra hole...<br />Maybe I got wrong one, but the package said I didn't. So this is my feedback. Since it took more than month from moment of purchase till I used it then I missed return deadline (if you are interested...) Still it does not change the facts."
2.0,Dead after 8 months.
2.0,"This device has only worked continuously for a single evening of light use. It was purchased to help get the network to a point in the house where my phone has little to no reception. The only device connected to this extender is my Android phone, all other devices use the 5GHz wifi band. After a few hours of trouble shooting over the course of two days I give up and will be returning this and looking for a different product.<br /><br />When it worked, it worked well; But it will only work for about two minutes at a time, at which point it will still show full signal strength but not connect to the internet again until restarted. This is unusable since two minutes is about enough time to queue up a song on Spotify. My advice is to not buy this. All the equipment on our network is Linksys and this still manages to not function."
2.0,"FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives.<br /><br />The photos show an apparent HP v250w USB Flash Drive, but it is a fake. Genuine HP v250w drives (altually manufactured by PNY) are made to a maximum capacity of 128GB. See &#34;http://www.pny.com.tw/index.php?mode=product_detail&PID=78&#34; for HP v250w product specifications and check for yourself. Any v250w advertised with a higher capacity is one of many Chinese-made counterfeits that have flooded the market.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low. Read on...<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine formore information.more information."
2.0,"very flimsy, got a good deal from Fry's on a better cover..."
2.0,Quite possibly the poorest quality item I've ever purchased.<br />wasnt cut out properly. Wouldn't separate from the paper backing. Ripped in several places. Filled with bubbles.
2.0,Too Flimsy.
2.0,Came with an external WIFI device and no indication that the internal WIFI card did not work. Packaging said I could contact the provider at any time but no contact info was provided? Unit works well as required.
2.0,"Sounds great - works bad.<br />I am using this on a MacBook Pro. THE ORICO should work. It partially works.<br />My mouse is a Logitech M305 USB connected via nub in the computer USB port. The other USB port is the Orico. When the Orico is powered up, I loose control of the mouse. It is Not smooth AND not controllable. When I turn the power off to the Orico, all is great.<br />This is repeatable. I checked all updates and my Mac OS X is completely updated.<br />The problem is definately the Orico.<br />I disconnect the Orico and figured I wasted $$ getting it."
2.0,Good case for the price. The included fan is noisy and not very powerful.  Not much room for cable management.  The SATA cables have almost no room to plug into your drives. Good budget case but anything else is probably worth it.
2.0,"While it is a beautiful piece of hardware, the cursor wobbles and jitters horribly when drawing anything that's not a horizontal or vertical line. This makes this tablet monitor unsuited for precision work, such as inking."
2.0,It only lasted a few days.  It's still charging my computer but the connection that goes into the computer is very weak and chinzy.  I would not buy this again.
2.0,One of the inside pockets has a hole.
2.0,"When it works, it works well. It's terribly frustrating when it doesn't work, and that happens way too much for my preferences."
2.0,"I don't know if this even worked. I tried using it on my old xbox but the desk wouldn't read. I tried it on my new Xbox and it played the dvd and it worked but I don't know if it did anything really. If you're old xbox can read DVDs but not games, then I recommend it. But no use for me"
2.0,"I read the reviews of this prior to getting it and i knew it wasn't anything spectacular, but it ended up being a bit worse than i had hoped. It works for all intensive purposes, you plug it in and it produces sound.<br /><br />where it falls short is everything else<br /><br />The first day i used it the sound seem to actually be louder than compared to my tablet speaker which was nice. It however by the second day of use it failed to produce much sound at all and i found my self putting the speakers up to my ears to hear it.<br /><br />other issues other than its functionality<br /><br />there big, and when i put them on my tablet they blocked the corners of my screen, though not much but more of an annoyance.There is also a red light in one of the speakers that tells you its on which if your watching a movie in the dark becomes very distracting as it is very bright.<br /><br />it could also have better grips so it stays on my tablet better but i wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />It did come rather quickly and without issue and its not terribly expensive so i gave it 2 stars because it works....just terribly"
2.0,Had this not even a year..screen keeps lcoking while I am typing n doin stuff....upsetting and disappointing
2.0,"Unresponsive, too small to be comfortable."
2.0,Recorded speech had a very metallic sound.
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this product, but when I received it, it was in really bad shape. the box was dented and sad looking. I dont know if it left the factory then, but it was a pretty sad birthday gift. When I opened it, it looked squished and damaged, but there was no particular flaws with the monitor. Looking normal, I tried to set it up, but it did not turn on. It was probably a defunct monitor. I will try and get a replacement, and from there, I will post another review, but until then, I will leave this review as a 2 star Monitor."
2.0,Microsoft as of 08-30-15 have NOT updated the drivers for this cam for use with Windows 10...... so sad
2.0,"Set up went horribly for this unit.  The CD that came with the unit had the setup instructions in Arabic, so I had to download them off the internet.  Still took a week and a half to get the unit to work properly, and it required changing registry files on my computer.  It had worked great thought since."
2.0,Mouse is jumpy and I could not get it to work on anything but a white mouse pad.
2.0,It was good but to much air bubbles it wouldn't smooth out
2.0,It doesnt fit well and the auto wake and shut off doesnt work.  I plan to return it.  Case seems made well but I wanted it for the auto on/off feature
2.0,It did not work for me and I gave it to my daughter. It was not as wide<br />as I thought it should be.
2.0,"This came in and worked well for my apps on my phone. I didnt realize until I tried to connect it to my laptop that it's software wasnt available. It would upload to Evernote, but it wouldnt let you do anything with it. The regular software was terrible and the firmware update didnt ever complete."
2.0,"The cable seems to work only with an adapter and will not work with the Laptop's USB port. It goes from recognizing the device to unrecognizing the device while connected to the laptop. So, if you're out looking for a charging cable and needs to use the laptop USB port, this won't work. I've tried it with 2 different laptops and 1 macbook and that didn't work."
2.0,could not see the back for audio requirement&#62;7.1 (NOT)
2.0,"They don't stick very well, fell off a few weeks after replaced originals."
2.0,The elf is a bit flimsy. The two prong plug is hard to keep in the wall and the charger itself separates easily.
2.0,Broke within a month of having them
2.0,"Quit working shortly after getting it, but past 30 days return policy :("
2.0,"The product arrived on time and appeared to be the same one pictured.<br />1.)The biggest issue is that the clear portion of the screen protector was designed very poorly by morons who were unaware or did not care what the actual touch screen size is. You cannot access the drop down menu by swiping the top of the screen, you can't access notifications, clock, etc. AT ALL, you cannot access the quick side menu that allows you to return home or to another open app, and if your apps have any need to you to swipe from the edge of the screen, forget about it. This case is nice if you're going to watch a video and not touch the screen. If you want a protector that allows you to have a protected, functional and usable fire tablet, this is NOT the one for you. It was clearly designed by idiots who did not even check their product specifications to see how much of the touch screen has to be visible in order to use your tablet at all.<br />2.) Don't fool yourself though, this isn't 100% waterproof. I dropped the tablet into a sink with water into it while reading a recipe, did NOT fully submerge the tablet, and while the tablet functions, the inside of the case was dripping wet. If I hadn't opened the case quickly and aired out the tablet, who knows what kind of water damage, mold, mildew might have ensued.<br />3.) The casing around the speakers muffles the sound so it is barely audible at full volume, and actually buzzes a lot louder than the sound you are trying to hear. Again, some genius product engineers at work here, can't even make a speaker cover that doesn't buzz louder than your music.<br />Overall, I would NOT buy this product again. I recommend you look elsewhere. If what you're looking for is a protective case that will protect your device from water and drops AND leave your device functional enough for even casual use, this is NOT the product for you.<br />The only way the company could possibly adjudicate this issue would be to redesign the case with more competent engineers and provide a free new design model to everyone who threw away their money on a case that renders their touchscreen edge useless, fails to protect from A HALF INCH of water, and renders their speakers unusable. Anything short of providing a free redesigned product would be highway robbery. Don't buy this. Do yourself a favor."
2.0,"Can't recommend this product.  The modular connector on one end will not snap into place on the back of my Ooma telo.  Connectors on other cables I own snap in without a problem.  Don't know if this is poor quality control or if this is a design flaw.  Also, the cable doesn't bend very well when trying to fit in tight places.  The product description doesn't state whether the twisted pairs are made of 100% pure bare copper wire or Copper-clad aluminium wire (CCA).  I suspect it is CCA."
2.0,Not at all.
2.0,"The product description was confusing, didn't realize I was only getting a cover for the Xbox"
2.0,"This mouse is a piece of crap. It looks great and I like the design, which is why I am giving it two stars. Otherwise it doesn't even deserve one star.<br />It was easy to install, just plug it in, the computer automatically installed the driver no problem. But the movements and clicks don't register. I then returned the original one I purchased and requested a replacement... Same problem with that one. Not to mention this Tonor Brand only has an amazon storefront, no website, no customer support found anywhere. Very unhappy with this purchase and lack of customer support. Don't waste your time/ money, you will end up returning it or having a nice glowing paperweight."
2.0,"This cooling tray is way too flimsy: a superslim PS3 weighed it down (no matter where I placed it on the tray) and the fans constantly scratched against the holding surface (noise). 2-day Prime shipping took 4 days. It also came with scratches on the main plate. The light was kinda neat but too bright and distracting to play games/watch tv in a dark room. It might be okay if you use it for cheap fans underneath spare space and don't put anything on it, otherwise it's not worth the $8 for parts"
2.0,Not much room inside for a tablet. Especially if you have extra items. Go for the next size up. Besides the space issue its a quality product.
2.0,"This is not a very good keyboard. Some of the specialty keys are not in the right spot, particularly the home/end keys. Also, it frequently loses keystrokes, a definite pain.<br /><br />I had to abandon the mouse because it made my wrist hurt after a day or so.<br /><br />What a waste."
2.0,"I ordered this product for upgrading my daughter's laptop before she returns to her college. This is not my first Samsung SSD - I have a perfectly functional Samsung 840 Pro 500GB installed on my own laptop.<br /><br />The drive hardware is quite fine. The adjunct software is absolute junk. Let me recount the experience step by step (and some solutions too).<br />1. First attached the drive using an external Sabrent enclosure to the laptop. The Windows 10 and the Samsung Data Migration refused to recognize the drive. For a drive that is $175 or so, I am surprised that this converter cable did not come with the pack.<br />2. Then attached the drive to a desktop (Windows 8.1 Pro) as an internal drive. Windows recognized and initialized the drive properly.<br />3. Then fixed back the drive using the same external enclosure to the laptop, now Windows 10 recognized the drive, but Samsung Data Migration Tool did not find the SSD.<br />4. A few long wait time calls and I was informed by Samsung that Samsung Data migration does NOT work on Windows 10 - and the very helpful team could not name any product that would migrate the data - and finally suggested that I roll back to Windows 8.1 !<br />5. I installed a Macrium Reflect Free software and it indicated that Windows 10 installation has 5 partitions (last two made for some additional recovery). But the software will not migrate from a 1TB hard disk (only 261 GB used) to a 500 GB hard disk because, well, because of no reason.<br />6. Shrank the data partition in the hard disk to 505 GB (would not go any below), then deleted the page file - since it is usually immovable, and then tried to copy only the first three partitions. This worked with a note from the Macrium software that my data partition is being shrunk slightly.<br />7. Once this step got over, I further shrank the data partition in the SSD by an additional 1 GB to make space for the last two partitions.<br />8 Finally, again used the Macrium SW to copy the lasttwo recovery partitions made by Windows 10.<br />9 Replaced the HDD with the SSD, and then restored the page file size to System default. Removed the Macrium Free SW as it was being detected as &#34;adware&#34; by Malwarebytes.<br /><br />The SSD drive since then is working perfectly. I am absolutely certain that this migration would qualify as an harrowing experience to most people. If Samsung cannot offer a Windows 10 Data migration tool, then perhaps it should withdraw the drive from the market till it has a tool to offer, or make a serious note about it on their website. Honestly, they should also consider shutting down their helpline - its about as helpful as the FCC warning label on the box enclosure of the disk - costs money, achieves nothing.<br />I have not had the courage to run the other SW that came along with - Samsung Magician - as am quite wary of these."
2.0,It is adorable however it does not stay closed on its own which makes it inconvenient compared to some if the others in the same price range.
2.0,"This case does not fit the Razor Deathstalker Ultimate case at all. I was hoping that it would have enough stretch in it to fit the keyboard, but it doesn't come close. I would further warn against using it for any larger full sized keyboard.  Over all build quality is decent, this is definitely not a bargain at $15, but I don't feel like it is over priced either."
2.0,"The two Inspirons I have bought -- in 2009 and 2015 -- have been a disapointment.  My X8700 I bought in February performs indifferently.  And like the older Inspiron, the hard drive failed within a few months of my purchasing it.  (Interestingly, the Dell monitor has similar plug-in problems to the one I also bought 6 years ago -- Dell doesn't seem to be fixing their defects.  Meanwhile, if your hard drive fails you are on your own.  You can spend extra $$$ on extra warrantees, and you still have to jump through all the hoops and be without a computer for weeks."
2.0,"Primarily chose this product for the noise cancelling mic for online vid calls like goog hangout, VSee, etc.: but it actually makes your voice &#34;robo-echo&#34; as co-workers told me. I suspect there's feedback using the Mac's &#34;Use ambient noise control&#34; feature, but not sure. [Will search the review posts/product questions to double-check. Will update the review with anything useful.]<br /><br />Anyways, the product isnt working for me. I almost wish that I'd order the new Apple Earbuds instead..."
2.0,"I have owned two flips. The first was the 4gb model which I had to send back because after one week it started having keyboard problems. I then ordered a 2gb model and had to send it back because one speaker was out. I have always had very good luck with ASUS equipment. However, my experience with the flip has been much less than what I have come to expect with ASUS. Other than that it is a neat little chromebook but I am now waiting for the equivalent Acer model due out this fall."
2.0,Breaks easily... wife is not happy at all.
2.0,It's extremely thin.  I can barely get it to zip up with the laptop and power cord.
2.0,"It's a nice bag, however, I was unable to zip it closed with my 15&#34; Dell Inspiron laptop.  Sending back and going with a 17&#34;."
2.0,"Backpack felt VERY cheap. The inside dividers were really thin, zippers felt cheap like they would get stuck. Usually AmazonBasics items are great budget items, but I would avoid this one at all costs"
2.0,I expected this fan to be a little bit loud but it makes quite a bit of noise even at 25% speed. Moves a lot of air and works great on my budget build! Would recommend if you arent looking to spend $30 on Corsair AirSeries fans!
2.0,The company provided zero instructions on how to use it.  They assumed it was obvious -- it wasn/t.  I threw it away
2.0,"I'm giving 2 stars because reliability of this router is bad for a high end product.<br /><br />I've had this for about 1 year and it works as you would expect most of the times... high speed, long range, etc. Sadly it cannot handle multiple devices using some bandwith concurrently for too long. I've noticed this since I started streaming Xbox one to my W10 PC while also watching streams in HD in multiple devices. The router seems to just not be able to handle the work,  everything communication dies for about 10 seconds in every device i have attached and then it comes back to life on its own.<br /><br />I've also had intermittent issues connecting devices to this router, for some reason it just doesn't allow them to connect at all until I power reset it.<br /><br />Yes, I constantly check for firmware and software updates, they haven't helped.<br /><br />I would recommend to people that are looking for a high end router to look somewhere else, this guy will fail you when you most need it for its supposed high end capabilities."
2.0,"Doesn't consistently stream a signal, cuts out and loses signal from wifi modem"
2.0,"Eh. It died completely after 3 months - cheaply made - boo. It may be cute, but not functional."
2.0,Case wasn't what I was expecting... Outside quality wasn't very good and the design for propping up the iPad is terrible... Went with the apple case instead
2.0,"I got this as a gift.  Loved it....until the on off switch broke....don't know why.  No unusual wear and tear.  It will work, but can't travel because it loses charge if the switch moves to on.  Went to order another....but for 100 dollars?  Don't think so."
2.0,Cheap stuff usually is not very good
2.0,I'm sure it is good for a non-digital application. It is not  right for me since it requires a cable to be run to the device I was planning to use it for.
2.0,"The tablet arrived with no charger or manual. However, the description says &#34;The product ships with all relevant accessories&#34;.  I bought this for a friend who is very dissatisfied that at least the charger was not included."
2.0,"Worked well the first day, now it doesn't work at all. Wouldn't recommend. Its cheap feeling and its better if you shell out a few extra bucks for a decent brand, not this generic china crap."
2.0,Doe not seem to charge the Lenovo lap top I bought it for.
2.0,Too short to fit properly in my Dell XPS mounting cage. Only two screw holes could be used.
2.0,"Came by the expected date. Also came with a nice pouch. However, the connection is a tad bit faulty. I ordered this adapter to connect our lab's Mac to our Optoma projector. The projector has a VGA cable connected to it, and this adapter in turn needs to be connected to this cable via the VGA-port-side, and then mini-DVI side goes into the port on our Mac. When I tried this for our lab meeting power point presentation, the slides projected just fine, however there was the &#34;blue-wash&#34; over the screen that occurs when the connections between display cables and ports are not completely flush. However, I made sure the DVI to MAC and the VGA to connecting cable were inserted as deeply and securely as possible, and yet the connection was still faulty. I had to bend the adapter cable 90 degree to the left and hold it in place with a heavy object for the projection to be completely clear. So it worked, finally, but only with some finagling. Unfortunately I have to bend it a little every time to get the projection to be clear, which isn't a terrible inconvenience but not worth 4 or 5 stars. (I am keeping in mind that the problem could be with the VGA cable to projector connection, however, this has always worked with no issues in the past with other connecting DVI to VGA Adapter cables, this new cable I ordered has been the only thing to bring about issues)."
2.0,"The product is cheap, but there is nothing else like these.  I bought 30 of them to use in a Bretford iPad Cart that has 30-Pin adapters in it.  I need a cart for syncing iPads in a tech department that can convert from 30-pin to Lightening.  I also need the adapter.... APPLE!.... that is not so freaking wide it won't fit with a case... APPPLE... if Apple didn't have their heads up some where they'd have made their official adapter more like this one so we could actually freaking using it... APPLE!<br /><br />So, I digress... we don't have quality built adapter to use, what so ever and it is Apple's fault.<br /><br />For being garbage, they work.  I expect them to break.  I have such a low expectation I won't be annoyed when these things fail."
2.0,"I've had it for 5 months and it's already history. Fails to hold the iPad securely, as many other reviews have noted. Now every time I use the touchscreen, the iPad falls out of the clips (you'll see what I mean in a few months of heavy use if you buy one). Makes it virtually useless, and embarrassing in meetings (as it will slap to the table, flattened, with a loud thud). Also, it appears to be scratching/marring the iPad screen, especially around the edges. Luckily this is a work device... if I paid for it myself, I'd be livid.<br /><br />Keyboard itself is great. Responsive, thin, and I type on it really well. A pleasure to use. Makes the fact that the overall design is flawed even more disappointing.<br /><br />Do not buy unless you don't mind replacing it in a few months, and keeping your screen free of scratches is not a priority. This is essentially an expensive, 3-6 month disposable keyboard cover that will actually damage your device."
2.0,Lasted a few months then the pin got stuck in my phone and it broke.
2.0,Not enough instructions and information
2.0,"the base mount is not strong enough,could have made little stronger ,<br />was only good for 2wks use"
2.0,"I was having some issues with my windows vista machine. I bought 2 of these to replace my current HDD only to find that when I booted my computer for the first time it bent me over and assaulted me sexually and without mercy...<br /><br />I'm writing this review from the police station in hopes to warn everyone,.. It's still out there, and it's hungry for more, If you see a compaq desktop in your neighborhood, don't bother calling OCZ support they are no help (if you can get an answer) Just get your biggest gun and show no mercy."
2.0,I ordered this cable set based on the fact that the description insists these cables will work with Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 4; the phones my wife and I own. Image 1 shows the micro connectors as looking identical to USB 1.X and 2.x connectors. Images 3 and 4 show them plugged in to what are obviously Samsung phones.<br />THIS IS NOT THE CASE!<br />USB 3 micro b connections are nearly twice the width of the previous versions. It will not work as a charge/data cable replacement for Samsung Galaxy phones!<br />Please update the description and photos for this product to accurately represent the appearance and use.
2.0,"It's been a good case for the most part. No cracks or anything like that, but the downfall is all the rubber gripping falls off after about a month or so so now my macbook slides all over the place. I would recommend taking them off and gluing them so they stay on better. The glue they use is crap. Invest in a Speck or Incase cover if you want my advice. That's what I'm getting. This is a waste of money."
2.0,UNABLE TO UPDATE WINDOWS 10 unless your some sort of computer geek uninstalling and reinstalling and uninstalling... windows update kills the storage space. Out of box after updates i have 10gb of space left
2.0,Super loud! :/
2.0,"I followed the steps very carefully and did my absolute best to ensure the Surface 3 was clean and dust free.  However, upon application, I noticed two small imperfections in the screen protector.  There were two spots where I could not remove what seemed to be dust.  Also, after application, the outside of the screen had some sort of residue that was difficult to clean off.  Once I was able to clean it off, the screen easily attracted fingerprints and smudge marks.  When using the Surface 3 without any screen protector, it wasn't as easily dirtied.  I feel like I'm compensating the original aesthetics of the Surface 3 for protection.  I was hoping that this wasn't the case from previous reviews.  I'm really contemplating just removing it and calling it a loss."
2.0,"My fault, thought it was wireless!"
2.0,"very cheaply put together. not made well, very flimsy no room for anything extra in here"
2.0,"very heavy duty cord. unfortunately in short order (6 uses)  it stopped working.  It charges intermittently but only if I squeeze the right area of the wire.<br />I had a 10 foot cord, much &#34;lighter duty&#34;  that lasted me years this one not so much"
2.0,Very basic without much substance.
2.0,2 stars for how fast i received package but as soon as i attempted to use the HD it was defective and gave my xbox red rings.
2.0,"I don't love this. It looks nice but it doesn't stand up great, it's pretty heavy and awkward for me.  I will use it for now but probably replace it eventually.  I wish I would have kept looking but it's hard to tell exactly what the problems are from just a picture.  Oh well....lesson learned."
2.0,nagging sporadic problems..... have talked to toshiba folks... windows 10 ??  close to sending it back...
2.0,I never could get the wi-fi to work and I am not technically challenged.
2.0,"I was shopping for a low-end discrete graphics card, mainly for 2D desktop graphics, because my Motherboard's built-in Intel Graphics doesn't have a dual-link DVI output for my 30&#34; monitor with 2560x1600 resolution. The GT-730 is perfect. It is inexpensive, low-power, and uses the latest 28nm process, although it only has one dual-link port, and no DisplayPort, so it's only good for one monitor with more than 1920 resolution.<br /><br />MSI is a good brand, and their cards usually use high-quality low-noise components. I was disappointed to find that this card is super-noisy. Because it is a half-height card, it has a very small fan, which will obviously be louder than a 90mm fan you'd find on a full-height card, but I found it to be unacceptably loud, even in 2D desktop mode. I used the MSI utility to adjust the fan-speed curve, but I found that on the desktop, it was already close to its minimum speed, at which it put out more noise than my CPU and case-fans combined.<br /><br />If you want the better GT-730 with GDDR5 memory, you'll be surprised to find that most manufacturers use this half-height format, which is bad if you prefer a quiet-PC. There is only ONE card that has a full-height format, the Gigabyte GV-N730D5-2GI, but at $80, it's somewhat more expensive than the others.<br /><br />What to do? Go fanless. If you can settle for the DDR3 memory, Zotac (and a few others) make a totally fanless card at around $55. I ordered that instead. It is perfect for desktop graphics, but obviously not for games. (I ran Team Fortress 2 (TF2) at 1280x960 resolution fine, but it's not powerful enough for anything more than that) -- I note that Adobe Photoshop can use CUDA cores for image rendering, so the GT-730's 384 CUDA cores makes it awesome for Photo-editing, and also video transcoding."
2.0,Not a tight alignment. Arcs prior to full engagement.
2.0,"I really like the case since it did everything i needed as was very well priced.  Unfortunately quality is lacking.  I bought one of these and the side pocket zipper fell off in two weeks.  I figured this was fluke, i bought a new one and the main case zipper fell off in less than two weeks.  Zippers are pretty integral to cases and bags and will get used quite a bit.  Any level of QA would have caught this.  Bu"
2.0,"Do not purchase ANY products from this company, especially Chromebooks.  They are poorly made and poorly serviced.  HP’s customer service knows nothing of either the customer or service.<br /><br />I have been awaiting shipment of my replacement Chromebook for over a month (details below).  Due to the complexity of my issue I was assigned a Customer Relations Case Manager (Vivian Hernandez, PPS CSS-A Customer Relations Case Manager).  Her co-worker, Paola Vanessa Picon was also included in all correspondence.<br /><br />The last I heard from either of these two ladies was on Aug 11th.  I was told that my Chromebook would ship on Aug 28th.  That day has come and gone.  Despite several follow up emails and voice messages I have not heard back.  Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.<br /><br />So here’s my story...<br /><br />In November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.<br /><br />Around Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.<br /><br />After about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.<br /><br />I called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.<br /><br />I received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it for a while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.<br /><br />After contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively I’ve spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.<br /><br />I’ve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, I’d simply give up and go away.<br /><br />Purchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you’re basically on your own.<br /><br />You’ve been warned.scovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.

2.0,Computer takes a lot longer rebooting since installed
2.0,You should only purchase this if you have no desire for a kickstand.  Ours broke in about 2 days.  I will say that the case is great and does what it is supposed to do but without the kickstand it's worthless.  So off I go to find another....
2.0,"Okay so i am editing a previous review I wrote about these. Because at first they were amazing. And they still are incredibly comfortable and easy to use. But, now I'm having difficulties after five or six months of continued use. They have a connection issue now. I'm not sure with what. But when I'm connected to my ps4 it will disconnect and reconnect constantly threw the entire time I'm playing a video game or just watching a movie. I'm very disappointed that spending 300$ on these headphones has gone to waste, and wouldn't recommend buying them"
2.0,Cheap junk!
2.0,"I find that is not as easy to use as my regular Kindle Fire.  When I am reading the kindle it freezes up (because you hold it on the side).  Also you have to get out of it to brighten or darken your text that you are reading.  Lastly, the advertisements that come up every time you turn the HD Kindle Fire on are annoying."
2.0,"This keyboard had a lot of potential, but I have to say it's done nothing but disappoint me. The keys are mush, and there's no insert key. There's also no menu key! You have to press the Fn and Shift keys to get it. Ridiculous. There was plenty of room for that key.<br /><br />You laid an egg, Microsoft."
2.0,"I purchased this unit and it is a good computer, however it is really loud. Like, the loudest computer I have ever owned. Computers have that little him in the background you can hear but this things is seriously like a turbine engine, its pretty unbearable and I dont know what to do with it."
2.0,"Looks cool, seemingly good quality, worked just fine and I have an iPhone and Android tablet so I was convinient....but I ordered last week and two days after I got it the Iphone charger prong broke off in my phone. Got it out with tweezers, no damage to phone, but I would not recommend."
2.0,Does not work with older version of Bluetooth. My advice is to check carefully for Bluetooth compatibility before buying. Even newer machines may not be compatible.
2.0,This fits a 17 inch laptop. Not really what I was looking for.
2.0,When you set it up on the long angle camera does not line up with hole in the case
2.0,"I had this installed and running fine for about 2 weeks and it just went dead one afternoon. So I contacted amazon and they immediately sent out a replacement. I installed the new replacement, but the drivers will not work this time. I went to ASUS website to download the driver also, and still didn't work. After 3 hours troubleshooting, I gave up and returned this card. It seems like this particular line does not have good quality control."
2.0,"Did not fit my Mac, but the color was nice. Returned and was promptly refunded."
2.0,"I cannot speak to all aspects of this product, but would like to mention one deficiency that is important to me:<br />Windows File Attribute Bits are not implemented. For example, if you set the Archive Bit on a file, it appears successful, with no error messages. Yet when you come back to File Properties, the Attribute Bit has not been reset. This is the property that caught my attention, since I make use of the attribute bit in copying only new files from the EX4 to an external disk drive for offsite storage.<br />I have a Seagate NAS which DOES implement the attribute bit, so I have been able to shift usage to that drive.  I have lost another NAS to lightning, and am considering purchase of a NAS to replace it. I like the EX4 otherwise, but I think it would be foolish to purchase another EX4 until this issue has been resolved. When I get tired of waiting, I will probably purchase a Seagate. ( I do not think that I have the High Performance EX4)"
2.0,"It's a case that any 17&#34; or 17.3&#34; (e.g., Dell 177000 series) laptop computer will fit. But, the paddding on the bottom & corners is marginal and unsatisfactory to protect the computer inside from anything but extraordinarily cautious handling. Likewise, the bag is flimsy in construction and the strap is easily unhooked from its plastic rings. I'd recommend spending more money and buying a heavy duty Swiss brand which would offer some robust protection."
2.0,"Returned.  Prefer a more open android tablet.  As far as quality...it is Amazon and they never disappoint.  So, if you are a strict Amazonian - this tablet is for you.<br /><br />The 2 stars are personal choice, not quality."
2.0,Horrible to put on and does not quite fit.... I even re ordered and made sure I had the right one for my nextbook... Poor quality...
2.0,"T I ordered a gray for my MacBook 12-inch laptop. The cover was disappointing because it had a visual flaw in the plastic... A bit of a brown swirl. I didn't bother to return because, let's be honest, it is only $20.  I could live with it. The plastic and manufacturing is very cheap. The silicone rubber on the bottom has begun to peel off and it leaves tiny pieces of clear silicone all over my pants when I use it on my lap. The edges are starting to wear.  This is brutal. I would gladly pay $60 for a problem free cover... The $19.99 price tag is starting to show.  Don't make the same mistake I did and think, &#34;whats the risk? It is $20, if it stinks I will toss it.&#34;  This is good enough not to toss initially but bad enough to give you just enough pain before you finally do."
2.0,I put all my pictures on both of them and when I plugged it in the next day it wants to reformat so I've lost all my pictures
2.0,"Sound quality is okay, but I am having issues with my microphone dropping in and out. People I call complain that I become very soft/inaudible at times. The headset is also very tight on my head. I had to [carefully] stretch the plastic overnight several times to get the correct fit. Next time I'll buy something more expensive."
2.0,"lousy.  plastic so soft it wobbles constantly.  Mounting is easy enough, but what's the point if you can't comfortably watch things once it is in place"
2.0,Not good quality. Very visible tiger striping and the adhesive wasn't great.
2.0,"Stopped Working after 2 months, suddenly stopped getting responses from the keys, the Back light was still on however and stuck on one color. reinstalled its drivers an nothing.  You are extremely Lucky if this Product works for more than 8 months!"
2.0,"I edited my review because after a few months, the case fell apart."
2.0,"Skip the combined device.  This had a weak signal and dropped out often.  I use it now as a modem only, using the ASUS (RT-AC68U) Wireless-AC1900 as a router.  Both work fine in that capacity, but you can probably save some money getting just a cable modem and just a wireless router.  My experience, and everything I've read, says stay away from combined modem/routers, they just aren't up to the task."
2.0,"This mouse is low priced and works good. It's not full sized but not as small as a travel mouse. However, after a couple of months of normal use, it's starting to act erratically: The scroll wheel has gotten weird and sometimes causes the the page to go in the opposite direction that you want. The cursor will move around mysteriously if the mouse isn't perfectly flat on the mousepad. The left-click button works intermittently now that the mouse has some wear and tear on it.  I'll keep it as a spare, but it got so annoying that I spent a little more and got another Logitech mouse that will probably last forever unless I physically break it somehow."
2.0,"Bought two of these mouses and had to return one because it would not track properly and the dpi switch buttons would not work. Thankfully, I was able to get a refund for the mouse, but since both mice were meant to be birthday presents it kind of stinks that one person will get their present on time and the other wont."
2.0,I did not need this when I purchased my Taotaole Multi-media Mini 800 projector...was of no use
2.0,Stopped working after only a few months!
2.0,"Was good for the first month. I've taken it off once a week since I put it on to clean it. I just took it off this evening to clean it and while I was taking it off, it cracked. This really makes me wonder how well it'd protect my MacBook Pro if it were dropped or hit against something with it on! I'll be buying a speck this time."
2.0,"I have not used this product, but the photograph here shows a &#34;QWERTY&#34; keyboard, and not the French &#34;AZERTY&#34; keyboard.  Wrong photo?"
2.0,Didn't work with Comcast
2.0,"I'm not one to write a bad review but s*** man, these didn't last month. Very disappointed, won't be buying from u again."
2.0,Two of the three cords will not charge. Cords are not flexible like the original cords.
2.0,"This charger has a loose connection between the AC (socket-side) cable and the brick which often comes loose and requires some unplugging and replugging to get working, and has a DC (laptop-side) cable that is waaaayyyy to short for most practical purposes. Two stars instead of one star because when the stars align, it does work."
2.0,"Very disappointed.  Sound is so low that I can't hear it unless there are no outside noises.  Will not connect with my blue tooth Jawbone.  Perfect size, but not up to par."
2.0,"Worked well for about six months. However after light usage, the covering on the end began coming off and my phone no longer recognizes it as a compliant product."
2.0,It is absolutely different as state in the specification.  I bought this 8dBi to replace my 5dBI antenna but the cover range is similar. I don't know how to refund this product. I will re-think to buy any production via online.
2.0,Very disappointed.  This power cord stopped working 3 days ago.  Unfortunately a waste of a few dollars.
2.0,The monitor came cracked in the upper corner. Therefore the screen was shot. Fortunately my son was able to canabalize the brain out of it and make our old one work. I understand these things happen but you should probably look at how these are packaged.
2.0,This would not mount to my MacBook Pro 2015.
2.0,Much cheaper but melts. Owned three and the longest any of them lasted was three months.
2.0,"It works ok, on a short term basis, but every day, at least once a day it gets patchy reception and then interrupts the signal blocking everything.  I found it better to simply suffer through poor wifi reception."
2.0,"The included cable does not match what was indicated in the users guide. There was only one connector on each end ( not two on the computer end and one on the drive end ). The disk has to be very carefully forced in since there is no room to spare. Ended up trying to use it out of the case since I was not sure if the drive would not short out in the metal case. I said try because it did not work at all with my USB 3.0 ports on my laptop. The laptop did know something was inserted in the port, but the drive was never recognized. ( I did try it in an old Linux machine using USB 2 and the drive did show up, but that is not the computer I was using this for.)  Updated star rating to two. Swapped the drive with one I had in a Vantec NexStar3 enclosure and they both work as USB 3.0 Devices. Still a very snug fit in the Sabrent, but a very comfortable fit in the Vantec."
2.0,Did not work for my samsung chromebook
2.0,"My laptop doesn't work very well while it's plugged into this charger, but it will charge it."
2.0,Easy to install but slow as a snail.
2.0,It's cute but it's hard to hold on to.
2.0,Case causes kindle to overheat.
2.0,Kept on freezing up!!
2.0,"It is not fit, miss spec about 1mm for upper and lower cases that can scratch your Mac"
2.0,"Had to return the product for the following reasons:  1. something is wrong with the WiFi interface. The response time is much delayed or non- existent.  My other WiFi devices ran well at the same time on the same network so it is not a router problem.  I tried to troubleshoot the device and could find no fix.  2.  I attempted to call the help line indicated on the enclosed instructions and found the number to be incorrect.  This outcome did not please me.  I'm sure Asus makes a good product but this unit (refurbished) has some issues.  I could not watch Netflix without excessive buffering and/or disconnect, and I could not even reach Kindle.  The apps that came on the PC did not work as well."
2.0,"I wasn't able to get it to work and I can't figure out why, the mini SD card works on the &#34;The Mini Drive&#34; just fine.  Also it sticks out further than I anticipated."
2.0,"Poor Reliability. Tablet worked well for the 2 weeks I had it, then it just stopped coming on one day. Only the red led charging light comes on, but nothing on the screen or sound, its totally dead. Luckily Amazon gave me a refund. The tablet worked well until it didn't. I had hoped for better reliability but I guess these cheap tablets just aren't reliable. Your experience may vary.<br />5 stars for Amazon refund policy however."
2.0,These chargers did not work on either of my kids nabis.
2.0,"I've had this keyboard for about 2 weeks now. Its not a very good keyboard. I suggest you save your money and buy something else. The keys constantly get stuck and you need to press certain keys like the ctrl button at a certain angle otherwise they will get stuck as well. The function keys are also positioned in a certain way that some might be uncomfortable with. The good thing I can say about this keyboard is that it is sturdy, but other than that, its pretty horrible."
2.0,"I have had this tablet a little over 4 months and I have problems. The colors are faded,muted not as good as my note 4 also there seems to be  a 2 inch band in the middle of the tablet that has problems picking up my fingers to commands like I am wearing out the glass . cleaning doesn't help. FYI  very frustrating"
2.0,Only charges via USB cord. Very inconvenient if you want to use with tablet or phone!
2.0,"Many aspects of this laptop aren't too bad. The price is very good for the performance. However, some huge downsides:<br />-Comes with a s***ton of bloatware from Acer. It took me at least an hour to figure out what to throw away and what to keep. What could I delete without gimping the computer? It's not very clear.<br />-However, I found out the bloatware runs even deeper. Need to upgrade your Intel Drivers? Gotta use the Acer drivers! Drivers which many games don't seem to recognize.<br />-RAM upgradability. You can't upgrade your RAM without a technician apparently. This is a problem for me; I live in Japan so I can't exactly go to Walmart.<br />-Hard disk upgradability. The s***ty hard disk read speeds are the biggest problem with this laptop. I thought I could simply switch out the hard drive for a better one, but this is quite annoying as they don't provide the laptop with a backup OEM Windows CD.<br /><br />The hard disk upgradability is a major concern for me especially because, just a few weeks after using this laptop, I get some random periodic slowdowns. Every 10 minutes or so, there's a 1 second program freeze (including games of course); my guess would be that its trying to access the hard drive but cannot go quickly enough, but it might be some of their integrated bloatware too. r<br /><br />It was pretty hard to find information about any of this. Most websites only review performance (which this laptop is not halfway bad at). But Acer are being dicks with bloatware. It's a real shame in light of things like the amazing quality screen, good performance and good price."
2.0,Did not see any difference in my range. I sent it back.
2.0,No applicable for gaming
2.0,Have downloaded very little onto it and  I'm low on memory
2.0,"I paired this with the Norco 2u rack mount case. This does not sit flush with the rest of the bezel. It overlaps, which is ok, but not very clean."
2.0,Battery doesn't last as long as reported and goes to sleep and won't come back on  until you place it in cradle to wake it back up.
2.0,"I've had this mouse for a few weeks now. My experience has been awful. I may have received a defective mouse? My old and trusty mx-518 BLOWS this g502 out of the water for responsiveness and tracking. In game this g502 is garbage, feels awkward in the hand but it looks cool i guess.<br /><br />First thing I did was turn off the annoying lighting effects, for a night gamer it was very distracting.<br /><br />tl:dr Keep your MX this G502 is garbage."
2.0,I may have gotten a defective unit.  It didn't pass the speed test when I compared it to my other old wires.
2.0,I give it a low rating due to stand not supporting device
2.0,It's 20 feet from my router on the other side of a wall (phone shows 4 out of 5 connected to main router) and the tablets speed is absurdly slow while connected to this thing. Maybe I can use it for spare parts in a project.
2.0,"The top, bottom and sides fit perfectly. the keyboard bezel is not sized correctly. The width is too wide so it either has to hang off to left or to the right. I found you can restick it several times..."
2.0,"These cords do not work for charging my iPad, though they do work for my iPhone. I was disappointed."
2.0,Worked for a few weeks now my laptop won't recognize it.
2.0,"For folks who simply needs to convert their iPad to a desktop computer, this Anker Bluetooth folio keyboard will work fine so long you are not typing in a quiet space near someone taking a nap.  The good: sturdy construction, good layout and responsive keys, strong magnet that holds the iPad steady when typing, connects easily with the iPad, strong holders provided to retain the iPad, nice faux leather and grey felt on the inside and cover shuts off the iPad screen when closed.  The keyboard is responsive and keys have good tension feedback by supportive springs.  For the short duration I tried the keyboard folio, I had no battery problem. The unit worked right out of the box and charged without issue.  The bad: works in only one position--desktop landscape with no angle adjustments and no portrait position use. In folio closed position there is no magnet holder or snaps or anything else that will hold the folio closed, which could be resolved by adding strong magnets outside of the iPad holder brackets. Like the IOS software keyboard no escape key is provided-function key and home key combo may be an option (I forgot to try it).  Cover captures fingerprints easily, but cleans easily. The keyboard keys cannot operate quietly.<br /><br />Had it not been for the one position operation mode provided, I would have overlook all other points listed as bad. The iPad is too versatile to have the keyboard operate in on position only. When operating the iPad and keyboard on my knees, another screen angle is required."
2.0,"Going to be fair about this reveiw, does not have an Amd A8 Processor nor does it have 8 gb ram. What it does have is a arm7 with 512mb ram and the listed 8gb storage.  That being said, it is what it is. Have requested a refund. Being that i bought it for the specifications. Now i can get a 512mb ram 7inch tablet for half the price else where...so hopefully beach will honor its mistake and fix its misrepresentation so others wont buy something they're not looking for."
2.0,it discharges too quickly
2.0,"Screen scratches really easily and the charge doesn't last any time, you can watch the percentage drop. Knew I wasn't getting top of the line by no means but this tablet got a lot of good reviews so I don't know if we got a dud or what!"
2.0,one of 2 mouses I arrived damaged and not working.
2.0,"It's okay. It gets hot but not too hot to touch. It also has a higher profile than the non-USB3 drive. I would rather have a lower profile than USB3 speed. So, meh, 2 stars."
2.0,"While the connection is working the unit produces a broad, strong signal which is a vast improvement over my previous router, the Apple Time Capsule.  However, a few fatal flaws.  The 5.0 ghz stops broadcasting randomly and often is not available.  Second, after the 30-day return window expired my unit continuously drops the internet connection, probably about 20-30 times per day.  It comes back, but after about 1 minute.  This is clearly not acceptable, especially since I rely on a consistent signal for my business as we use the internet for our phone line.  If the connection maintained this would be an excellent option.  I recently updated the firmware and the problem actually has become even worse.  I will be contacting the company to see if I can get it replaced or returned post 30-days."
2.0,"I have bought, and intalled many screen protectors and this one by far was the hardest to apply. There were many bubbles. Although the video Mr. Sheild provides tries to help you get rid of the bubbles, I found theire tecnique actually caused more bubbles.<br />The tecture of the screen protector is very nice and if you are better at getting rid of bubble than me I am sure it would look sleek."
2.0,The bottom part of the case isn't very secure.  Update: Started cracking after about 2 months
2.0,"A few issues that made me return this ZenPad within a couple of weeks of getting it:  - It was slow (browsing, keyboard, etc.), even compared to my now defunct Nexus 7. - It was buggy: for some reason the &#34;recent apps&#34; button kept pressing itself, rendering the tablet useless. - I was not thrilled with the 4:3 form factor (found it harder to hold with one hand) - Battery life was not that great - and recharge times were very long. - The display sharpness and colors were nice, but that was about it overall."
2.0,Bought this for my nine year old son because he was having so much fun with the lego stop motion ipad app.  This is a glorified webcam.  It kept disconnecting itself from the computer and I needed to restart the software.  The software was not fun and didn't have any fun extras like the free app on the ipad.  We just bought another $10 toy called a Stikbot that looks promising and goes with the free app.
2.0,Not much better than an omni-directional antenna!
2.0,"I've had 2 of these speaker systems in the last 5 years, and now I'm going to Logitech or Creative. The speakers and sub sound great, amazing in fact, but the problem is with the controller pod. Seems the pot doesn't last more than 2 years or so. One of the speakers will quit working...press down on the blue lighted center of the pod and great sound. Let it go, and one speaker dies. As I said, the speakers are fine, it's in the pod. Take note C/A, fix that crappy pot and you've got a great little system for 30 bucks."
2.0,It broke too fast.
2.0,"Would be cool, except this thing can't handle HD youtube video.<br /><br />The Battery life is fantastic.  The simplicity is great, the speed of the machine for simple tasks like email and stuff is all good.<br /><br />But this machine simply CANNOT play youtube videos.  Its just a matter of graphics processing.  Watching a youtube video in 1080p at  is not possible on the samsung chrome book.  This really is disappointing because I LOVE THIS THING outside of this massive short fall.  I think I might have to return it which is really disappointing...<br /><br />If you are watching a video that is mainly dark, it handle it for the most part but as soon as the scene changes and a lot of light textures are shown on screen the video will become choppy and broken.  Its a shame, but it renders this Samsung Chrome book virtually useless for me... its a damn shame."
2.0,Not all apps available
2.0,I can't get on to put our password. I was on the phone with some lady who was not helpful. I had trouble understanding her. I will try to call back to get someone who has English as their first language.
2.0,The power connection and device seems a bit finicky.  I no longer plug any storage devices on here because they tend to randomly disconnect and reconnect instantly from my machine when they are used through here instead of directly.
2.0,"Works, but was falling apart as I installed it.  I received a call from the manufacturer asking for my feedback, and when I told them this they said they would refund my money, but they never did.  I feel this is a unreputable vendor and would not recommend."
2.0,"I had the 1st Kindle Fire and was very happy with until I broke it. I got the basic model, which was smaller than the original but cost more. I think charging so you don't have ads was dumb and I refused to pay for it. Other than a camera I saw no real improvements."
2.0,"It is good for a protective case, and they keyboard works ok. But it was made very poorly. The stitching started coming apart within a week, and although i barely use my ipad, after only a couple of months the velcro stopped working all together."
2.0,if it supported all the e-text book I had to rent then I would have kept it. Its the perfect size; if they come out with a newer version which support all my e books formats I will buy it.
2.0,"This PC can't really run newer games (Insurgency, War Thunder, Heroes and Generals, Europa Universalis 4, these games I've had big problems playing. I have to"
2.0,Case does not stand well and auto sleep/awake feature does not work at all. Not as protective of my device as I hoped. If it was dropped it could fly open and device could break as it does not stay closed. Hand strap does not work if device is used sideways. Disappointed with this case.
2.0,"UPDATED 10.1.2015:<br /><br />Just barely over 30 days and drivers are crapping out all of the place.<br />Haven't installed anything, just used it for the web.<br />Liked it for the first two week, now its just another P.O.S.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Works just as described. Fast to open and set up. Came with microsoft 365 with no issues.<br />So far its exactly what I am looking for in a small netbook on the go for work & class.<br />Definitely not meant for heavy gaming but the graphics are good and the sound is great.<br /><br />Wish the keys were backlit but its alright."
2.0,Not fitting properly
2.0,Didn't last long &#60;(;o(
2.0,Doesn't hold a charge for very long. The charge cord that it came with sometimes doesn't work. This is unfortunate since my daughter loves this. Frustrated.
2.0,"We purchased 2 of these for our kids.  They both saw a decent amount of use, but one more than the other.  One device lasted about 2 1/2 years and the other almost made it to 3 years.  The device begins to get lines through the screen so that it is no longer possible to read everything.  After numerous resets and attempts to solve the problem, and the lines continuing to get bigger, we eventually gave up."
2.0,"I am disappointed because I feel like I have been had by the sales marketing fine print again.<br />I was under the impression I was purchasing a 10 port hub which would charge all 10 of my devices at once, my bad.<br />I should know by now to read between the lines."
2.0,"I did not get the screen protector in the package. The color is exactly what I wanted. However, it is not a perfect fit for my mac book air. I am having a hard time opening it my screen all the way. The two pieces are scraping against each other, its ruining the plastic. I am not sure if it will harm my computer, going to keep an eye on it."
2.0,I was disappointed in the material and it did not contain the stylus.
2.0,"I was disappointed to find that it was for a 13&#34; Macbook ONLY. Unfortunately the description says it fits 13&#34; or larger, which technically is true, but Jordan is too far from touching the bottom of the computer, which makes him look obviously too small for my 15&#34;, and it's awkwardly disrespectful to cut off the limbs of the greatest basketball player of all time. I decided to toss my purchase. If you have a larger computer, save your money for another product. The product itself is okay, you get what you pay for, but the description could have been updated to reflect what should actually be expected for the &#34;or larger&#34; part."
2.0,very difficult to put on.  This is the second iCarez product I've gotten and still have the same difficulty. I can't explain exactly but putting it on the ipad was difficult.
2.0,Didn't last long &#60;(;o(
2.0,I bought it for my mom. She thought and still thinks it's cute. It may be just a defective case. Most of the time it stays awake when the case is closed. It was a easy to go to setting & let the iPad go into sleep mode after nonuse after 2 minutes or even other times but I shouldn't of even had to since that was one of its  features. My other complaint is that it just looks like it was cheaply made & I'll be buying another one a lot sooner that I should of.
2.0,I'm sure it was good tabelt but screen arrived all discolored and static so I was unlucky
2.0,The battery is horrible. I can only use it for twenty minutes before it needs to be charged.
2.0,I had had this drive in my computer for a while an though it was an overrated regarding how fast SSD boot up until I replaced the SanDisk with Samsung SSD.  That was night and day I found out.  Never buy SSD from this company anymore.
2.0,"Decent product, but wifi stopped working after a few days (even after multiple resets and updates). Extremely disappointing"
2.0,Bottom came with one of the hooks broken...
2.0,"Product held up great for the first two months, at first it would charge my phone at 1100-1800Mah now it only charges at a rate of 433Mah"
2.0,"The screen and light is nice.. no way to make the print BOLD so it can be easier to read though.. This is my first kindle, and will be my last.. I purchased it a month ago.. I have had to talk with customer service about 8 times.. I really have not had problems with Amazon service before with any Amazon products I have purchased over the years.. ..this seems to be a new problem.. I have contacted 4 times about the fact that I cannot download a &#34;working pc app&#34; to sync the kindle to.. always get &#34;technical&#34; department.. they say the same thing. I even got an email and took screen shot of the errors.. been over a week and no reply to me.. If I couldn't sync it to the computer.. I wouldn't have bought it.. another reason I got it was to transfer different documents to the kindle from my PC, so I can read them more closely while relaxing on the computer.. I finally got one file on it and it is SO TINY on the kindle.. the writing and pictures.. it is useless.. It is a normal pdf file.. looks large and easy to read on the pc.. since this is 300 ppi do I need to &#34;resize&#34; pdf in Photoshop ?? all documents cannot be resized.. there appears no way to adjust the size in the kindle itself.. I am very disappointed.. I guess I will only be able to use Amazon sold books on it for &#34;Pleasure Reading&#34; for which I have very little time to do.. guess it will be just an unused gadget here.."
2.0,"A couple of weeks after installing the battery into my laptop it would loose all charge and the computer would shut off after minutes of taking it off the charger.  I cannot use my laptop without being plugged in.  I would have returned it but I did not install the battery and discover this issue until it was too late.  The fit was perfect and the price was reasonable, I will probably try another because this one was obviously defective and it was my fault that I couldn't return it."
2.0,Its short of being garbage. Don't buy it... It sheds whatever the material that the cover is made of and the built in stand is a joke...
2.0,Didn't work in raspberry pi
2.0,Awkward to use in tablet mode a bit large for me.<br /><br />Retuned it.
2.0,This mouse pad is definitely comfortable and it's features are as expected. Except for the fact that it doesn't work with my mouse. I don't know why.
2.0,"I bought this large capacity hard drive in April 2013. In August 2015 it failed. Fortunately, it failed just slowly enough that I was able to get one last backup copy onto an external 4GB drive. Just 3 days after this backup, the drive no longer shows up on my Mac. I can't even format it - it's just gone.<br /><br />Hard drives are expected to last more than 2.5 years, so I can't recommend this to anyone. I'm going to replace it with a Toshiba drive and hope that one lasts longer"
2.0,I bought this headset as a refurbished and both the mic and headphone didn't work.  Sent back right away and bought a new pair.
2.0,"I've used at least 2 other sets of keyboard stickers from other brands, all of which lasted a long time. These started losing their print, sliding around, peeling up and coming off after about a year."
2.0,Didn't fit my husband's truck. Size a bit misleading
2.0,slow as Christmas best I could get was slower than USB 2.0. 25 mbs transferring a 20 gb file.
2.0,Very good
2.0,It is not able to pump by inflatable boat fully so I still end up using my foot pump. The cord is very short.
2.0,"I like the flat design, but this is not for use with video.  I bought this to use with a pair of  HDMI extenders for a projector. Dropped a lot of pixels, leaving white edges on video.  Replaced with a Cat7 cable and all is well.  7/3/17: Finally surrendered the long video run after the CAT7 failed within a few months. Rewired to put entertainment within 25ft of projector and we are back to working. No problems in the last 3 months."
2.0,"Remember you are getting what you pay for. Mine came in I hooked it up and an hr. later it overheated and died. Then I was able to get it running again, I built a special stand for it mounting it vertical and placing a small fan blowing n it. Then came the wireless keyboard wnd mouse problem. It won't recognize both of them at the same time. O.K. now I start missing things like cd/dvd read write capable desktops. Then more memory, usb connections, card readers, etc.... I should have waited. Hindsight is always 20/20."
2.0,GOOD.
2.0,"Like these at first - sturdy, colors are nice, good length, and they worked (at first).  Now they will no longer charge - not &#34;compatible.&#34;"
2.0,Stopped working!
2.0,Too much $$ for what it actually does!
2.0,Get what you pay for. Would be great for traveling with kids and setting up wireless in a hotel
2.0,Nice clean fit. However product started peeling off after a couple months.
2.0,Case broke soon after buying. Not good quality at all.<br />Save your money and buy a case from Apple instead.
2.0,"This would be a pretty nice tablet for the money, if it didn't come with un-removable malware. The Ads interfere with your normal usage."
2.0,"I know my son researched this product pretty well and we purchased it. Maybe we got a &#34;lemon&#34;, but it didn't not perform well at all for us and I ended up returning it after 4 days. With such tech specs, I expected better performance. It was VERY slow opening apps and programs. I often had to turn the Wi-Fi on and off in order for a social app or email to refresh. And the last straw was when I got a black screen. We were able to do a hard restart and reformat it but at that point it was beginning to be too much trouble. Again, maybe we just got a &#34;lemon&#34;.<br />I did like the size - it fit nicely in my hand. The weight was lovely - not too heavy."
2.0,The power button is difficult to push to turn on . You have to poke it with a flat screw driver
2.0,Charging portion on tablet broke after about 6 months of use.  Not heavy usage by any means and did not use an after market usb micro but both tablets that we owned failed the exact same way.  Don't think I will be buying another HP tablet.
2.0,This product did not fit my Macbook Pro with retina display. I own the newest version which was released early 2015. Gave it two stars as it wass partly my fault for not reading the description closely.
2.0,It broke fairly fast
2.0,"Not very durable or well constructed. The plastic tabs that hold the iPad in place are easily broken. Additionally, the stitching where the stretch headrest band connects to the velcro portion has come apart with limited use. Will not be replacing again and very displeased with the short lifespan."
2.0,"It was difficult to install - the AutoPlay notification only came up on the third try. Then after an extended installation time, I could not figure out how to get it to play a video. I put a disc in, the drive would whir, but nothing opened up. I expected it to start playing when I inserted the disc.<br />I finally figured out that if I go to the VLC media player software on my computer, I can open videos through that. I've spent a couple of hours googling and trying various things and that's the best I could come up with."
2.0,"Its screen turns dark some time for no reason. Just bought for the price, but overall do not like it."
2.0,"It says that it is MiFi certified, and yet 7/10 times that I plug it in to my iphone 5- I get the &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; message. Very disappointing. Luckily it was inexpensive"
2.0,"Nice idea, but little protection.  My daughter and I both got Surface 3s and each received a case.  We chose this so you could use the kickstand, but in getting that you give up protection of the bottom half of the screen.  (That protection goes out with the kickstand.)  Like others have said, you have to keep track of the strap.  I started a return, but after visiting multiple stores with no covers in stock, I decided to keep it as it's better than nothing.  We are waiting for the Incipio hybrid cover, which is like this but has all around screen protection.  Hopefully this protects us until then."
2.0,"Since Kindle Keyboard, I've been frustrated and unhappy with every model I've tried. I don't use my Keyboard anymore because I need better contrast and lighting. I've been using an iPad Mini with the Kindle App, but have been looking for a lighter-weight alternative.  This time around, despite the nice lighting, light weight, and text clarity, I disliked the haptic page turning. My unit froze while in setup so I had to restart and configure manually, without the tutorial. I was frustrated that once I linked to my Goodreads account, it threw a page of books at me, all check-marked to send samples to my device. I tried to un-check the checks, but that's when it seemed to freeze. After resetting, Goodreads seemed not to let me bypass the samples page, so once I managed to un-check them (extremely slow responsiveness), the button to continue was obscured and so I ended up anyway with a bunch of samples I didn't want, cluttering my Cloud list. Also because I couldn't find out online which ads on my Kindle were considered &#34;recommendations&#34; vs. ads, I had Customer Service call me. It then took an hour for the patient representative (a supervisor) to determine the answer to my question: Was the band of ads at the bottom of the homepage removable with vs. without purchase of ad-removal? After some more resets and such, we discovered the answer together, by default. Finally, with my ad-removal purchase they were gone.  Then I began downloading a couple hundred of my Kindle books, but by the time I got them organized I had realized how slow and unresponsive the device was with page-turns and navigating the menus. That, together with all the other problems and not liking the pre-determined brightness on automatic setting, I just gave up on the whole darned thing."
2.0,"The stylus could use alot of work. The rubber at the bottom comes loose from time to time, and this is really annoying because you have to try to fit it back on before you use it. Don't buy before they fix these problems"
2.0,This product does not support the 5GHz bandwidths so don't buy this item if you want that feature. It's decent as a wireless adapter but the Wifi software that comes packaged with it sucks. You will be better off just turning it off and using Windows to scan for Wifi points.
2.0,Not needed
2.0,Worked well for about 3 weeks and then it broke. Very very cheap device... Highly recommend getting something else.
2.0,Not compatible with Windows 10
2.0,this product is not like  iespect it to be I dot like it. It does not function properly.
2.0,Recorded a couple of times and then stopped working.  The USB drive remained functional.
2.0,"I had this for about 9 months. It was truly easy to use and does what is advertised.  Worked fine for the first 6 months, now I cannot get it to work at all.  Neither my Laptop - where I used the most, nor my desktop recognize it.  Not sure why."
2.0,"I was excited about this when I ordered it since reviews said the Mac didn't need a separately installed driver.  Clearly they didn't do anything to test it since Yosemite came out about a year ago.  I thought perhaps the info hadn't been updated.  The unit regularly stops functioning and is hot.  A restart will get it working again.  However, if you're copying files over your network and it locks up, you'll have to discard the partially copied items and start over or nearly over.<br />I contacted Linksys and they said they hadn't tested it with Yosemite.  I asked why since it came out almost a year ago, and got no response.  The person then suggested I change the MTU value to below 1500 for the whole network.  I'll give it a try, but that's a workaround not a solution.<br />Use this ONLY if you occasionally have to wire up for something.  Don't use it for your primary network connection."
2.0,"Not worth the hassle to set up for such lousy speeds. Claims up to 150mbps, yet max I could get was 13mbps vs. 36mbps from the Hootoo tripmate nano [[ASIN:B00HZWOQZ6 HooToo Wireless Router, Access Point, Wireless Hard Drive and Flash Drive Companion - TripMate Nano]], vs. my bigger, hard-core Netgear unit of 42mbps that sits right at the source (it's always on, these other two were tested in a farther away room that has ethernet access & hooked to a router that also powers my TV, etc.)<br /><br />I had the previous version of this portable router for about 5 years till it finally died & it worked much better than this with faster speeds. I originally replaced it with the TP Link 150 nano router [[ASIN:B007PTCFFW TP-LINK TL-WR702N Wireless N150 Travel Router, Nano Size, Router/AP/Client/Bridge/Repeater Modes, 150Mbps, USB Powered]] which is easy to set up, but I found it unreliable, esp. for some of our computers more than others (some would constantly show as &#34;limited&#34; while others had full access & restart of computer wouldn't clear it up, and some occasional dropping or loss of connection. the main difference noted was the Windows 10 computer hooked up happily, but the Windows 8 did not seem to get along with it very well.).<br /><br />Set up hassle details:<br /><br />Being dissatisfied with my first replacement router I then decided to go back to the ASUS portable I had previously and this is apparently the newer version (skinnier otherwise the same). However, setting this one up is a real pain in the bum! IF you have a computer that has a ethernet port, and IF you have a CD drive you may think it's not too awful. However, most thinner laptops today have neither, and there begins your troubles.<br /><br />Normally you can just go to the IP address of the router and set it up with it's new name, access code, change the admin/admin login etc. Well for whatever reason this didn't work with this, because when I typed in the IP it wanted to use it directed me to just about every Netgear router in range, trying to get me to login to those (ugh!!). Just for fun I went ahead and tried, but obviously other folks had changed their login so it didn't work. (the hootoo has a totally different IP to use, so no conflicts occurred with it) So, then I decided to go to the ASUS site and see if I could download their set up utility from there - nope! Don't have it. They only have some updates to address some security issue to download and the pdf users manual.<br /><br />Feeling cranky but not wanting to drive to the store (too lazy) and not wanting to order something else and send this back (too much effort) I decided to hunt around all our various systems knowing at least one had an ethernet port, then went and dug up my old external CD drive. I then followed the instruction offered on the CD to use their wizard for install - another fail. It would get stuck on one screen and insist I didn't have the router attached to the computer via the ethernet cord (which, of course, I did). So I then exited the wizard and just downloaded the set up utility. Suddenly the ASUS router was a happy camper and gave me my screen to login to it (it opened a browser window with the same IP address used previously but it said the right router name this time - yay!) I was then able to change my settings, add my security password and change the admin/admin so no one else could come in and muck about when it's turned on.  It then gave me some funky &#34;you're set up wrong&#34; message with the face of some little construction worker looking cartoon man, which I ignored and just powered off and back on the router. Voila! Once I did that everything else behaved as expected. We can login to my re-named network, with my selected password, and you cannot login to the router settings w/o the new password I set. I can also access it from any computer now (no need for the downloaded utility ) and access the router settings.<br /><br />So, if you want a faster speed don't buy this router. If you don't care about speed (shock & horror...) but you read the above and it all sounds confusing to you don't buy this router. However, if you read that and &#34;get&#34; what I'm saying (and don't care about speed) you'll be ok, or obviously if you read it and decided I'm an idiot because there's an even easier way I don't know about, well you'll obviously do fine too (if you're right & you don't care about speed, or you think you know how to make it faster and I'm an idot, maybe you'll love it.....)<br /><br />Once up and running, so far reliable and easy to use like my last one, but horribly, horribly slow. My daughter (who uses the non netgear wifi the most) says it's painful running her games on it, so! Back to Amazon it goes. It sucks, after all the time sorting it out and getting it going. Although I've never been much of an ASUS fan, so am not too surprised I'm unhappy with it. Yay for the HooToo, which luckily I decided to try.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Buy a HooToo or something other than this.

2.0,Very flimsy plastic but adequate to mount on mini tripod on my desk for use with FaceTime
2.0,Didn't last but a few months. Severely disappointed.
2.0,"Very upset that the back-light on the keyboard shuts off after 3 min, i would not have purchased this keyboard if i had known this.  I game in a dark room and use a mouse and game pad for game play, but when i go to type to the other players i have to hit a key in the dark to turn the lights on then hit backspace to get rid of the key i just pressed. The mouse just scrolls through all the colors and is very bright!!  There is NO way to turn off the light or change it to just red to match the keyboard, i do not use the mouse because of this.  it just sits in my parts box.  The mouse pad is beautiful!!!"
2.0,The screen protector is terrible quality compared to an older survivor case we own.
2.0,"The original charger that came with my MacBook was made in Japan, had the Apple logo on it, and also says &#34;Apple Japan&#34; on the side.  This charger is a slightly different size, and the wall plug attachment fits differently.  Although this product has worked for the past several weeks, I do NOT consider it a &#34;Genuine Apple&#34; product.  It also runs a little hotter than my original charger.<br /><br />It works so far and cost only $34, so I'm giving it two stars."
2.0,All the anti-slip rubber adhesives came off from the case within the first week.
2.0,"Unfortunately the internet port did not work, probably it's one of the risks of buying refurbished stuff. I had to return it and get a new one. I never had issues with my older Cisco router."
2.0,works only sometimes. super bright blue light that bugs me.
2.0,Boots up fine but will not play ps4 disc
2.0,"I had this product for one week before the auxiliary cable stopped working properly and now the Microlab speakers only work if I keep the cable in a certain position. The clip-on is shallow and has poor grip which makes it loose, wobbly, and slip easily. Requires a USB and a headphone jack, when there are similar products that only require one of these to be occupied. When the speakers work, the audio can be loud but the quality is mediocre."
2.0,The buttons on the bottom fell off and one of the clips were broken.  Not very happy with this product.
2.0,Pales in comparison to the Targus (PAUK10U)<br />The PAUK10U is more durable and comes with a built in USB hub.<br />This item worked well for about 9 months and then certain keys began to no longer function when pressed.
2.0,The case rests on the volumn button.  If it wasn't that I would have loved it.
2.0,"I own a Kindle 2nd Gen and the Kindle Fire HD.  After having them about a year they stopped charging properly.  I have to hold the charger a certain way to get any charge.  It first happened with the 2nd Gen and I thought it was strange, but figure I had inadvertently done something to cause this problem.  I received the Kindle Fire HD as a replacement the next Christmas and after about a year, I'm having the same issue.  I have replaced the chargers and still the same issue. One of my co-workers expressed having the same issue with her Kindle and I told her what I do to get mine to charge. When I contacted Amazon they wanted to give me a discount on the purchase of another kindle....really, why would I purchase another Kindle when the first two have the same issue that you can't explain."
2.0,I'm not exactly sure what happened but someone definitely interfered with this product or the packing was terrible as the plastic covering was moved and the pre prep solution was missing and the tubing was not flat and sticking out of the packing
2.0,slow as Christmas best I could get was slower than USB 2.0. 25 mbs transferring a 20 gb file.
2.0,Kind of flimsy. Not very strong.
2.0,"It was a great tablet at first, but the issues it has ruin it for me. The wireless adapter cuts out randomly to the point where wifi setting can't even be accessed without a restart. There is barely any of the memory available for use. I had about 27 GB available after upgrading to Windows 10 before installing apps and programs. It often freezes and I'm not crazy about the screen resolution.<br /><br />The writing experience is great. I love the pen and it's speed and accuracy. If it didn't have the aforementioned problems, this tablet would be absolutely perfect but I need across the board functionality. I'm most likely going to send it back."
2.0,Narrowness of the introduction was not as wide as expected E4
2.0,"Not great quality ... It *worked* OK in our 2006 MacBook, but it's not a perfect fit (see other reviews) and as soon as I installed it and started using it, it &#34;bulged&#34;.  Oh well, I just needed a working battery in it so I could sell it, but the bulging battery was definitely a turn-off; I probably would have returned it if we were keeping the laptop."
2.0,i used it for approximately 3 months then the battery did the same as mentioned many times. charge it goes from 100 percent to 70 to 20 in minutes. I am having a hard time locating battery for this item.
2.0,"Cons-  When you're shelling out $659 for a graphics card the last thing you want to see it do is sag in your case and that's exactly what this does.  The power Pin Connectors are upside down too which doesn't help either,  so if you don't have 8 pin cable extensions be prepared to twist and pull your cable's for them to connect. Also the card looks nice but feels cheap compared to the reference model or the matrix.  Problem- Upon receiving the card and installing i noticed that the fans in idle were running and that the temperature of the card would sit around 48c to 61c, coming from asus gtx 680 that would sit idle at a temperature of 32 c . Did some digging and found out that some people had the same issue with it running hot while idle. No real answer other then guesses that the heat sink isn't connected properly.  Result- Returning it today for being defective, i have to say having this card was short lived but from first hand experience I am not impressed and disappointed. Don't get me wrong Asus is a great company but they can do better. I feel that i have dogged a bullet and will continue to wait for the 980 ti matrix."
2.0,This thing is flimsy. It can barely hold the weight of an iPad Air 2.<br />It is not worth buying. Spend the extra money for something better. Like maybe three twigs from your backyard tied together with shoelaces.
2.0,small which I wanted but the communication to pc is scatchy
2.0,"This keyboard has been a bit of a disappointment.  Based on the reviews here I was expecting better.  I haven't had any problems with it connecting or staying connected, and the dongle is behind my desk.  That being said, 1) there is no on/off switch on the keyboard and mouse like my Logitech set has, 2) the scroll wheel has no clicks and is completely erratic, no matter what I set it to, and 3) the function keys are way too small and hard to use.  The small function keys and non-clicking scroll wheel are the main reasons for the two-star rating.  I wish I had used this keyboard more before my 30-day return window was up - I would have sent it back.  I use the function keys a lot (e.g. F4 is repeat last formatting in MS Office, etc.).  I didn't think the smaller size would be an issue from the photos, but in actual use it is pretty annoying.  No click wheel on the mouse is enough for a two-star rating just by itself.  The behavior of the wheel is so bad it might as well not have a wheel.  It's completely erratic in every browser I've tried (IE, Firefox and Chrome).  That being said, the extra keys for volume, mail, etc. are nice, and worked with little or no configuration, which was nice.<br /><br />If you don't like a click-wheel on your mouse you should be ok, but if that's important to you skip this set."
2.0,I have had this case for less than 6 months and the hinge on the right side is now broken.
2.0,The thing I do not like is that the cap does not stay on the end<br />when it is in use. They have to come up with a better design.<br />The stylus end works great!
2.0,"Hated the fact that the dye turned my pretty white glow light into smudge city- good secure fit, but not clean"
2.0,"I bought it in July 2012. Haven't really used it much. It start to double click and also drag when i click the left mouse button after just a year of minimal use, but was too bothered to leave a review or to ask for a new one since i was working on Cruise Ships. Now i got pissed and i am leaving this review after 3 years. There. Not a good mouse at all. Too bad i spent those money on it. Shame Logitech. Shame. Shame."
2.0,There will be no rebate..Everything was done that they asked ...Still no rebate.. waste of my time...Want be buying another sapphire product..
2.0,This did not fit my keyboard for the selected laptop. It was half the length of<br />My keyboard.
2.0,Sent the first pair back because of buzzing noise from left speaker. Amazon replaced promptly but new set only marginally better. Not a great product.
2.0,"When it works, its great. But every few days, when I go to open it, its just a blank white screen.  I looked online and contacted asua support and no one had an answer. Asus told me to do a factory reset, which solved nothing. Now I can't send it in to get repaired because I need it everyday for college.<br /><br />Buy if you're willing to gamble. Maybe it'll be reliable, maybe not. Asus tech support was slow and unhelpful."
2.0,"I've had this keyboard for several months, and use it quite a bit (about 45 hours per week). I got it because so many blogs reviewing ergonomic keyboards chose this as their #1 pick for people who spend lots of time on the computer, and who get fatigued when working with standard style keyboard and mouse. Some of the keys are great and feel great to type on, however, I am giving 2 stars for this rating just because of the clunky, loud, cumbersome space bar and 'enter' keys. Otherwise the layout is great when you get used to it, but I find the clunky keys so distracting that I am shopping for a new keyboard."
2.0,"the fan flickers, and sometimes the product does not turn on. It does not do a great job keeping my computer cool, i wish i could get my money back or at least a repalcement."
2.0,sparks when pluged in is unsafe to use
2.0,"The extra long cord is a plus but this inexpensive adaptor fails to charge my son's Hp touchscreen laptop's battery.  Powers the laptop fine, but fails to charge the battery.  Not recommended."
2.0,"I bought this to use with my Thinkpad T440 laptop and 26&#34; monitor, which supports only DVI and dsub connectors.  When run through the DVI cable, this adapter produced horizontal green lines and dots all across the image, which made it unusable.  I tried a DVI to HDMI adapter and ran an HDMI cable to this, and still received green dots on the screen, although less than with DVI.  In screen mirroring mode, it was usable.  But if I tried to &#34;Extend&#34; the displays, the horizontal green lines came back.  I know it's not the quality of the cable, because a different brand DP to HDMI adapter works flawlessly with the exact same components and cables.  I may have got a defective one, YMMV."
2.0,It interferes with the main wifi
2.0,Spend the extra 10$ and get something better.
2.0,Advertised as new but was not. Someone else had set it up as administrator and required a password. Has to reset just to to be able to use. Still has someones back-up of something on it. Still has someone elses username (as administator).
2.0,"This thing has pretty acceptable quality resolution screen but the power charging and battery hold is what makes this a terrible tablet.  How can one rely on this tablet for school, meeting or even leisurely use when you can depend on it to work properly?  I would recommend purchasing something else such as a Samsung or other leading brand as you get what you pay for.  This brand is cheap but don't count on it working for long. Its camera is inadequate in that photos are blurry and grainy at best."
2.0,The arm broke 2 weeks into using this.<br />Not enough reinforcement and now it occupies a space in my &#34;unused&#34; computer peripherals.<br />Just a gimmick and not worth the money.
2.0,Bad product never worked really well. Wish I could still return it
2.0,"I purchased this iPad Air 2 case about 9 months ago in gray.  I initially liked almost everything about it, especially the transparent hard plastic back that revealed the Apple on the back of the iPad.  The magnet is strong and works well for wake/sleep.  It has a soft inside cover with simple lines, low profile.  Today a piece of plastic dropped off a corner of the hard clear plastic back.  When I examined it more closely, I noticed cracks on all the corners and that now the case can barely hang on to the iPad.  I'm glad the plastic fell off so I could discover the problem before the iPad dropped entirely out of the case onto the floor.  This case has had light use and no abuse so I think it should have endured much longer.  I had purchased a different brand case for my husband's iPad Mini at the same time.  It has a &#34;rubberized&#34; back and is still functioning and looks great.  I don't like the appearance as well as the Yippee Color Series, but it's obviously more durable.  I'll try that next."
2.0,It's ok sayings always true you get what you pay for......
2.0,Tedious to align. Several air bubbles. If you don't get it right the first time subsequent attempts are more difficult.
2.0,"Good and easy to put on, but after barely any wear and tear its starting to bubble and come off after a month"
2.0,This product it really dangerous i believe cos it get`s too hot hot and may cause fire hazardous
2.0,I charged this tablet to 100% but then only get like 1 hour of battery life before it goes dead. The specs said 6 hours of battery life.
2.0,"Do not buy this keyboard...it is advertised with a trackpoint, but it has a rubbish optical trackpoint, which doesn't come close to being the real thing. It isn't nearly as accurate and it is more like a very tiny touchpad than a real trackpoint. The only plus is that it fits my tablet.. the keys are nice, but the main reason i bought this was the trackpoint."
2.0,Disappointed. This started flaking and peeling almost immediately.  Will not repurchase or recommend.
2.0,This didn't work as expected.
2.0,"One day in my backpack, and case was rubbed and scratched all over from rubbing with my textbooks. I take the case off occasionally to clean underneath, but this time the corner of the top-piece cracked. This is because it fits too tight where the plastic clips onto the computer. Won't buy this case again. (One of the rubber feet of the case fell off once too.)"
2.0,"Did nothing to improve my wifi from a 10 year old router.  Not a bad product, but not an upgrade."
2.0,"Bought this because new cable modem provided by Comcast seems to have a weaker WiFi output as I can no longer get a reliable signal from upstairs.  Put it in upstairs hallway, now I get a great signal in the hallway, but almost non existent in any of the rooms upstairs.  Looking to return this product."
2.0,Picture IS MISLEADING! This is not a grounded 3 prong plug. It is A 2 prong. Would not have purchased had picture shown this.
2.0,love the color and the build but the top of the item did not stay on
2.0,"I couldn't wait to get this camera and put it to work. Living way out in the desert and with crime on the rise in my town, daily stories of home invasions, robberies, car theft etc focused the concern for my family's safety.  I wanted to get a setup with a few wireless cameras to monitor the house and one that would work with my smart phone.Being on limited income due to my disability I was pleased to come across this deal and thought at least I can afford one and maybe add more if it worked out.  I was happy to see it arrived very quickly!  Well, not so happy now that I have been playing with it all day. I am unable to get the wireless setting to work, it only works if its hooked to my router. Also no zoom and when I pan up, down, left or right it has major lag time and has to catch up! REALLY FRUSTRATED!!! I guess I will have to leave it just plugged into my router so it can monitor my sofa."
2.0,"Looks nice...however, you need to modify 3 things for it to work properly. Being that it's $10, a) what'd you expect, b) it'd be a waste of time and money to send this thing back so I just modified it:<br /><br />1) There are 2 pins on the circuit board that are too long and are touching the case. This will cause your computer to not connect to the drive. Simple fix, bend those 2 pins down. 2) When connector plate is connected to the drive the connector plate is off center and will not close properly. Simple fix, shave one of the sides on the connector plate. 3) Since the connector plate is off centered, the screws are not aligned properly. Simple fix, widen the screw holes on the connector plate."
2.0,It broke right after putting it on :|
2.0,"The picture was better looking than the real thing. The bag does not have enough external pockets for electronic gadgets. When I put all of them in the internal pockets, The bag bulky and hard to access these gadgets. What prompted me to return the bag was the fabric for pocket within the front zipper-compartment repeatedly got stuck with the zipper when I tried to zip it up, wasting a lot of time to gingerly remove the fabric out of the zipper. This would be bad at the airport security. Also, the fabric will eventually got torn and has a premature death."
2.0,"My husband ordered this laptop for his grandmother and has a lot of experience with computers and laptops as he use to repair them. He got everything going on it and every time it was turned on it made the loudest screeching noise from the speaker. Even if we turned the volume down it would still do it. He tried some things to fix it and nothing helped. He said with over 1,000 laptops/computers that he has dealt with he has never had anything like that happen. We returned it and got an Asus."
2.0,The storage was only up to 59.4 GB wasn't 64 GB. Very disappointed
2.0,Didnt fit quite over my ipad mini
2.0,Just had a minimal effect on our home wireless network. Easy to setup though!
2.0,Modem died in less than 45 days. I hate Century Link. Options are limited though here in Southern Arizona.
2.0,Long and doesn't kink but the end is loose on everything we connect it to.
2.0,"Finally assembled the computer, Graphics card does not look like the graphics card on the pictures, 2 fans instead of one (im not sure what series it is) installed the driver, updated it, every game crashes."
2.0,Wheels on largest suitcase are difficult to maneuver when packed.
2.0,"I purchased this product thinking it looked easy enough  to use and the price was right.  When I received it I followed the instructions, however, I wasn't able to insert one connector into another that was supposed to slide together.  I tried repeatedly to get them to slide together; no luck.  I didn't want to damage the connectors so I opted to call the companies tech line.  After all they did insert a small piece of paper into the instructions that pacifically said their customer service techs were standing by and will be &#34;happy&#34; to help.  I called and when connected I could hear the person breathing on the other end but no verbal response.  I finally said hello is anybody there?  The person finally started to talk but never announced who he was or what company he was working for.  Anyway, I was trying to ask if this was a product I had was defective or was this the way the connectors worked on all the devices.  Well he started to talking over me to silence me and was rude and verbally abusive.  I was talking to him in a normal voice and was shocked and taken back by such an unprofessional response to my inquiry.  It continued from his end as I wasn't allowed to get a word in edgewise. It continued getting worse and going down hill from there.  I finally had enough of the verbal abuse for one phone call and hung up.  This product is of poor build quality and it would appear the companies customer service is no better than their product.  I would encourage to buy another brand unless you're into verbal abuse and poor quality products."
2.0,"not bad, but not loud enough unless it is right in front you."
2.0,"I should have let the price - instead of the other ratings - be my guide. The case looks and feels cheap: the rubber outer is too large and constantly coming off after just a few weeks of use. The kickstand is flimsy and gets in the way. You can't feel the volume toggles and have to search for the slightly raised buttons. Worst yet, you can barely reach the iPad's ports and buttons due to the strange way the cutouts are laid out. It's big and pink, which is what my daughter likes. It's cheap, which is what I like. Still, I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"I ordered this on June 22, 2015.  I left my laptop unplugged for two days and the battery has already died and won't power up again.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this item again. Barely lasted two months."
2.0,"I already order  four but just only 3 are working, I was expect all the four card working, I feel you want this item , request only one , try if is work , if not you can return the item...,"
2.0,The computer will not run very long without having to use electric power.
2.0,"I have returned my Orbo Jr. for a replacement.  The reason I returned the item was that I was unable to connect to my Wi-Fi.  In reviewing the web for a solution my sense is this may be a commen problem.  Nonetheless, the Orbo Jr has all the features I wanted for my grandson so I am going to try one more before I give up."
2.0,"This item should have been good, but was DOA.  Returned.  Thanks to Amazon for making these arrangements so easily."
2.0,Corrupted the Mac on boot. Not the right accessory
2.0,Although this VGA adapter looks identical to the Apple original- the clarity of the images during presentations was greatly compromised.  I gave it a try and ending up sending it back to purchase the Apple product.  Saving money on a product such as this was not worth the trouble.
2.0,It's very flimsy.
2.0,"I like the product, it is really nice and practical, but I am really disgusted with Amazon, as I ordered 2 of these organizers, and they where delivered in different dates but worst of all they were diferent sizes and brands. Actually one of them was much smaller and generic brand, but it was paid at full price. I can't return the product as I received it just a day before I was leaving.<br /><br />Talking about the product it is a good product, at least the original. It holds everything into place."
2.0,Impractical and unnecessary. Sorry I bought it.
2.0,"The first thing when you switch it on is &#34;ASUS: In search of incredible&#34;. Then you then get this: Awful non-vibrant colors, very short battery life, charging takes a whole day, crashes frequently, changes volume without user input, and the plug for the charger is already so clumsy that I am sure it will break soon. As developer, I have bought this device for testing my app on it. If I would have bought it for real use, I would have been very disappointed. In other words, compared to my 3 year old iPad 2 it is crap."
2.0,"This keyboard works as advertised but the right shift key is too small for touch typing. There's simply no way to hit it consistently and the keys around it are functional in ways that will change the field, page or even the screen you're working on. It's so frustrating to be typing away and then look up to find out you're no longer even in the same application you thought you were typing into."
2.0,"These break often if you aren't careful, currently on my fourth. And they usually seem to break just outside of the return window."
2.0,Not high quality as it was described to be.
2.0,My old kindle was actually a better one.The speakers on this one stink.sound is distorted and fuzzy at best.It sounds as if the speakers were blown from the day I got it.it's a fourth generation and if I had to buy again I wouldn't.
2.0,"Got what I wanted, just a simple cover until I find one I like better"
2.0,"Slips all over the place. Sorry. Great idea, but I have to wet it daily to keep it from sliding."
2.0,I read the many reviews of this iPad case complaining that the case did not turn the pad on and off as advertised.  I also noticed that the company acknowledged the problem and had a fix.  The cover I received would not (could not) activate the on-off switch on my iPad 3. I wonder how many times this iPad case was delivered and sent back by customers.
2.0,Disappointed now that the motherboard failed after about 2 months. .The initial symptoms were the screen going dark and unresponsive except for the status bar at the top of the screen.  Also the door holding the SD card doesn't stay secured so the card would unmount.
2.0,Brought the blue ombre for my MacBook Air because I'm messy and get stuff everywhere. Let me just say it's not awful. It does pull up every once in awhile when your typing. It kinda gets stuck to your fingers I guess. I does fit over the keyboard well. Sometimes it moves but nothing unbearable. I was content until I realized that my books were blue and fingertips were blue. At first I just thought it was excess dye but when it didn't stop after the first couple of days I got annoyed. Its been a week now and I've noticed that the keys are starting to lose their color now because the ink is all over y fingers instead of the keys. Just a heads up! I will never purchase again.
2.0,This thing is really slow. Tried to take advantage of the number of features but system couldn't handle it. Now I just use it for backups and minor file storage/sharing.
2.0,I bought this charger because I liked the extra long cord. It worked great and charged my tab and phone really quick but 2 months later it takes hours to charge my tab and phone and the cord keeps falling out of my phone.
2.0,I have purchased these before and was always pleased for the price. This item is cheap and the folds are improperly spaced and not parallel to the edge. It is not a worthwhile purchase.
2.0,did not work for my laptop
2.0,Product works well and was delivered on time. Only issue is that the mouse misses one of the optical sensor (bent b shaped) pads.
2.0,Not needed
2.0,one  of  the  new  gadgets  that  promises  way  more  than  it  delivers.  content  hard  to  access  and  really  is  only  a  weblinker.  Close  to  worthless  item
2.0,Could not get it to work.
2.0,"I've owned one of these for over a year now, I like the picture quality but it has major issues with actually working.<br />I will turn on my pc and the monitor won't leave sleep mode and says no signal. The channel buttons won't work either. I usually can get it to work after a few minutes by unplugging and plugging it all back in but now it's just not working anymore. For the price, it's ok when it works, but it's worth avoiding if you don't want to deal with issues of getting it to work."
2.0,"The people posting five star reviews after owning this for a week should be ashamed.  This is a 2-3 star product at best.<br /><br />Advertised at 199 and then an absurd percentage &#34;off&#34; is misleading. It is a $60 tablet selling for $55-60. I got a lightning deal last thanksgiving and at $47 i wish i had returned it. But i kept running into issues with the cord not plugging in all the way so it wouldnt charge and it has sat forgotten for multiple stretches of weeks.  Finally figured out you need to peel the cover back to get a good connection, which means the cover should have had a slightly bigger hole.  It takes about 6-8 hours to charge and lasts about 2-3 hours, way less if you have wifi on. So if downloading something, plug it in first. And dont download two things at once, or try and play and download at the same time. It says dual core but my guess is it is sporting some old processor and a cheap battery.<br /><br />If you have the patience for downloading slowly and one at a time, and want to limit tablet time to a few hours, and need an inexpensive tablet with a very sturdy rubber case, this is not a bad deal. So it gets 2-3 stars. But anyone giving it more than that is stretching the truth. Or have kids breaking their $100-200 tablets...<br /><br />A perfect example, charged overnight, son played it this morning while trying to update two apps and download two games, so with wireless on battery was at 9%. After having to redownload one and find the other after a frustrating search to figure out where it downloaded to but didnt install. Charging for an hour now, its at 17% and that is with wireless off..."
2.0,"The absence of a forward facing camera made it unacceptable.  Otherwise, it probably would have satisfied my needs."
2.0,I was very unsatisfied with this. It did not fit my tripod so the ipad wobbled.
2.0,Numerous issues keeping both tablets linked to WiFi and Bluetooth keyboard. Have to restart them when they freeze. I bought two and both have the same issues.
2.0,"Received this and it will not let me open apps. It will let you download them, but when you go to open some of them, it says it's unsupported."
2.0,"Zags are better,rather uncomfortable."
2.0,"Lighting too dim to be useful. Font used on keys blocky no-traditional adds to viewing difficulty. Non-gamer, was looking for keyboard whose key faces would not wear off. Keys pretty much blank with illumination off."
2.0,"As for the description its great and matches up with everything perfectly for the most part. The problem is when gaming for periods of time this isn't able to withstand the heat output even with the fan manually at 100 pct the entire time. the fact that the card is also overclocked and that a person will not be able to lower it will create issues with certain games, Call of Duty Advanced War being one of those games as the game has an issue with overclocked graphics cards.<br /><br />My purpose was to spend a bit less money than needed and hope to get something that can keep up, although I now have a graphics card which I want nothing more than to get rid of this and spend the extra $100 to get something much nicer"
2.0,"Fits well and seems like it offers protection for the device, but the viewing angle is way too steep for typical tabletop or airplane tray table use and is very tippy.  Tried various combinations of bends in the cover to try to work around problem but none of them satisfactory. Returning item and will try something else."
2.0,"I like the fact that the tip is replaceable, but the stylus is kind of small in my large hand. The two piece connection comes loose at times, and I have to make sure the ball end is tightened. But it beats the alternative of constantly purchasing a new stylus (talking about other brands) after the tip starts to tear.   I have found that the Targus stylus is much better."
2.0,"Product well built, with the exact right number of extra pockets, materials seem OK, but I have 2 major issues:1-the inside compartment for the Surface Pro is super tight (even a USB mouse dongle a few mm tall on the side does not get in), and the case itself is extremely heavy: weighted up at 2lbs (heavier than the surface Pro itself).<br />At half the weight (and less padding, which would still have been good enough), and the internal sleeve slightly more loose, would have been a perfect product.<br />I am actually looking at unseeing the internal compartment to save some weight and being able to leave my dongle on."
2.0,"This card works ok with Windows 7, but gives me lots of problems under Linux.<br /><br />Under Linux kernel 4.1.6 (Slackware) the card will associate with my WNR3500L Netgear router but will not connect."
2.0,"JBL has been a reputable manufacturer of audio speakers for many years. I wonder if many reviews are tainted by that fact as these speakers do not follow in that tradition.  The sound quality - the reason you purchase speakers - is in a word, muddy. Since many laptops don't deliver good quality sounding speakers, a good pair of headphones makes a better investment rather than a pair of poor sounding speakers. Although well designed aesthetically, these speakers are also actually much larger than they appear to be."
2.0,"The only good thing about this product is that it keeps my keyboard free of dust and possible crumbs. I've only had it a few months and the gold color is already fading on certain keys. Some of the letters are also off centered, but I wasn't too upset about that seeing that this was only a few dollars. The paint used to color the cover also rubs off on the frame of my screen when I close my laptop (I have the Air so the screen frame is silver instead of black like on the Pro.) and it's kind of hard to wipe off."
2.0,Wasn't correct size
2.0,"The case is cute and sturdy, however the snap does not stay on the computer and falls off frequently. Maybe there is something Im doing wrong though."
2.0,Pretty garbage. Slower and less powerful than even the one that comes with the phone. Had gas station chargers better than this.
2.0,Looks cool but is very slow.  Takes about an hour per gigabyte to transfer anything.
2.0,Works fine but NEVER lose the USB power cord. I lost my cord over 8 months ago and I haven been able to find a replacement since then. I've written Wacom Customer Support 3 times asking them to please send me a replacement but apparently they do not make any extras (hard to believe but I guess). Their suggestion was to go to an electronics store to find a USB Micro A or B that fits in their tablet but guess what ... none of the standard sizes do. The plug end of standard USB cords are too big to fit into the Wacom USB port.
2.0,Very difficult to install!
2.0,The UNO works fine. The LCD module does not light up.
2.0,Never could get it to work properly
2.0,"The case worked great for about 4 months, however its durability over a long period of time is questionable. I did not use my tablet heavily, maybe 3 times a week at most, but the case has already lost its protection integrity. I have NOT dropped the tablet/case even once, and I have NOT removed the tablet from the case once I put it on. Keeping this in mind, there are 3 out of 4 corners on the case that have cracks/cracked. The two corners at the top of the case have cracked so much that they are missing pieces. The lower left has a crack but the plastic is still in place. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the corners are the pieces that essentially keep the tablet wedged into the case. With the top two broken, and another cracked it is only a matter of time before the tablet will become lose and fall out of the case. Other than that, it is a decent case. The sleep/wake function works as expected from the smart cover. Magnetic cover stays latched even when holding the case upside down and stays flat when closed. See pictures for more details."
2.0,I liked the laptop but had to return it. The screen would turn on only half the time so I spoke with Asus support which was very friendly & they said it either has a defective screen or graphics card & they recommended that I returned it. I may reorder but think I will look at other laptops before I do.
2.0,"Personally this case is not worth the money...first it seemed like the top half of the case didn't fit and had to be forced and I didn't want to force it, second, within about a month it started to have stress cracks and the edges on the top half of the case chipped off. I was extremely disappointed because i had such high hopes for this case."
2.0,"Cool design, but WAYYYYY overpriced for what you get.  I picked up a Talent iClaw and it works just as well for a fraction of the price."
2.0,So i thought i bought the battery a year ago. Turns out i bought it 8 months ago and its dead already not conpletely it still lasts 45 minutes under regular use but not enough to get me through class.
2.0,This is actually my second case I've had for my kindle. The only reason I had to replace the first was due to the edges peeling away from the case. I don't really think this is a defect though. I read a lot of books and my Kindle is usually slipped into my purse where I'm sure it rubs along the edges and eventually the coating peels away. The case has stood up well but I did manage to get a grease spot on the outside and decided it was time to replace it with the fun design above. The only negative thing I can point out is that the case does not exactly line up with the back when opened. That's pretty minor though. I'm sure I'll continue to get these cases and recommend to anyone who asks. You can't really go wrong for the price. Follow up.... THIS DID NOT LAST 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE COVER STARTED PEELING OFF. POOR QUALITY.
2.0,"It may work for other people, but not for me. Sure, it connects to the internet, but I am two doors down from my router and I am still only getting one to two bars."
2.0,Loved the case while it lasted...it pretty much disintegrated after a couple of months. I love how it looks and how it functioned but was pretty sad when the hard plastic disintegrated :(
2.0,"Overall a very nice budget gaming mouse but with one glaring problem: it randomly disconnects itself from my computer. It remains physically attached to the USB port, but I hear the Windows disconnect sound and it stops working until unplugged and plugged in again. This happens on multiple USB ports and even in a USB hub. Shame because I liked it when it worked, but it had to be returned as defective."
2.0,"Windows 8 recognizes Orico case as Removable Disk, but unable to access installed drive.  Computer Management and Disk Management utilities shows 'No Media' despite using a known-good drive when using the Orico case."
2.0,"As far as sound and overall build integrity go, these things are fantastic. I love everything about the set. The only gripe I have about them is the cord, which completely failed on me. It developed a moderate bend after only a few months of careful use. I doubt that the braided cords of the higher-end models are as fragile, so when I have enough money to do so, I'll be moving up to the 7.1 Chroma.  Update: The adjuster band broke after I set the headset down. I did nothing out of the ordinary. It just snapped."
2.0,did not hold up well
2.0,"Bought this item to use with my iPad. It functions well, however every time I slightly bump or drop the stylus the tip immediately breaks off and makes the stylus non-functional. I tried to buy replacement tips and they cost $6 for a pack of three, which is almost half the price of the stylus. The reduced flexibility of the rubber on the tip causes the writing portion to break very easily. Not worth the buy in my eyes. I would return it but Amazon won't take it back."
2.0,"The case looks good on the laptop, but within a few weeks it already chipped and pieces have broken off.  Also, I don't feel like the top piece fits correctly, can't clasp it down to cover the edge like i'm able to with my other MacBooks/cases.  Helps avoid scratches, but with how it's breaking off and chipping, it's not really protecting the computer."
2.0,"The memory would not work in my computer, but the vender promptly refunded my money."
2.0,"PS Oh yeah I forgot to mention that sometimes when i right click, it just clicks and takes me to another page which i dont want. My SD card port is already not being detected. (only had for 2 months and 3 days). Plus side: it has an optical drive, but I don't think the programs installed allow for full screen playback of DVDs."
2.0,Only lasted a year and now the kindle store option wont work. Wanted to be able to buy books on it but now cant do that. Resolution is also poor.
2.0,"Slower than my crucial drive of matching specs and failed within 3 months. I'll make sure to update this review one day when the replacement drive finally arrives. Though before failing it did cause random system crashes, hopefully the replacement will function better and for longer, but the minute I popped in my system clone on the crucial drive the crashes stopped and its been a perfect system again going on 2 months."
2.0,Not so &#34;heavy duty&#34;. After a month only one of them is working. That didn't cost as much as the others but it would have been nice if they had lasted longer.
2.0,I purchased this cord for an iPhone 5 and while the lightning port does plug in the cord will not charge the phone. The micro USB plug does work to charge my android but the fact that the cord doesn't do what I purchased it for is very disappointing. The caps that cover the plugs are not attached to the cord in anyway and so get lost very easily. I would not purchase this cord again if given the option.
2.0,"With a full battery, one of the fire tablets i purchased will shut off b for no reason and not turn back on"
2.0,it does not say affixed or in position.<br />I wanted because it appeared it could easily be put on and taken off regularly.<br />That has not worked out. it bows in the middle or falls of and makes using the touch screen awkward or impossible.
2.0,Didn't work with Comcast
2.0,"BD stopped working after a short bit of usage (DVDs seems to work though).  I bought a different brand and everything works fine so it's not the computer, software,disk or cabling.  Maybe it was a dud but I had to buy a different brand and that one seems to be working better, longer for me."
2.0,"Worked very well for a few day. A FEW DAYS. Not weeks, not months, have to keep it plugged in juuuuuuust right or sound cuts out just a few days after purchase. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this one."
2.0,"The keyboard feels great to use, looks awesome and has extra features that are quite useful.<br /><br />However, I received and started using it on May 7th and it stopped working on August 29th. Considering that my previous keyboard lasted over 8 years, this only working for about 4 months is a huge disappointment. I did not mistreat the product or spill anything on it, the wire is still seemingly flawless, but it just does not work when plugged in. It seems as though something in the color changer is messed up, as it started to go bad a month or so ago where the backlighting colors were off. That slowly stopped working and then the keyboard's actual functionality ceased shortly after.<br /><br />The seller did offer to replace it if I paid for shipping, however I elected not to use this option as I feared receiving another defective product."
2.0,"Worked well enough while it was working.  However, it died just after a year of use.  Conveniently just after the warranty was up."
2.0,Pros:<br />Scroll Wheel<br />Placement of ball is better than with a thumb trackball<br /><br />Cons:<br />Placement of buttons is uncomfortable and hard to work with<br />Left mouse button fails and quickly - I've had 2 of these and the left button failed on both of them within a matter of weeks. I'm not a hardcore gamer - but I do like to play video games occasionally. This is not something that I expected.
2.0,"Feels crappy, very cheap. Would not fit into the recessed round outlets in Europe making it useless"
2.0,"Sound isn't top quality, but what would you expect for 10 bucks? I have to buy another set to replace these as the microphone sound quality is horrible in Teamspeak. People tell me my voice now sounds metallic, garbled and fades in and out - and the headset is brand new. The ear pieces can be uncomfortable on the ears, kinda stiff and they don't flex at all to sit properly on the ear - instead the edges jab your ear."
2.0,"I thought this case was going to be rubber, it's actually styrofoam, but it is good for my daughter's tablet."
2.0,"However the keyboard was excessively small relative to its size and the space bar worked inconsistently. Had to return it because of the space bar issue. If you don't encounter the space bar problem, you very well might like this laptop."
2.0,"Don't waste your money on this one. The cover feels like it's made from a cheap plastic picnic tablecloth material, though the print was pretty. I did like the hand slip-on strap. The thing I liked least is that the tabs that are designed to hold the tablet in place are not strong. My Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4&#34; did not fit snug and securely. I returned it. Didn't give me peace of mind. I bought a Fintie brand cover instead--very nice quality."
2.0,"Finally--a lightning cable that my cat won't chew! The value in this fact makes the classy gold color merely a bonus for me!<br /><br />Update 6/10/16: The seller kindly sent me a replacement for free after the first one fell apart, but the replacement stopped consistently working after only 2 months.<br /><br />Update after 6 months of use: This cable was wonderful for the first 6 months! I had zero problems with it, it was awesome to have a longer cable, and my cat had no interest in chewing on it (she still doesn't).<br /><br />Unfortunately, over the past month, the lightning end of the cable began to fray and separate, exposing the wires. When I first noticed this, my phone was still charging, but within a week or two, it would only charge if I had it in *just* the right position, and now it won't charge at all. I'm disappointed and frustrated that it only held up for 6 months, but it was great up until then!<br /><br />At this point, I can only recommend this product for people who are desperate for a lightning cable your cat won't destroy. :)"
2.0,Good case.....volume controls are misaligned on ipad2 air. I know why the silver was on sale!!
2.0,Has a bad habit of not wanting to pair after it goes to sleep have to shutoff and restart.
2.0,"I finally decided to stop buying cheap routers because I was tired of constantly rebooting them. I was initially very happy with the decision. The router was problem free for about a year. Now, I need to reboot the router every few weeks. I think it is time to give up on Netgear. If they can't get it right on a high end home router, I can't see them getting any of them right."
2.0,This keyboard was a disappointment.  I wouldn't purchase this product again
2.0,"Great laptop, but has some serious issues with sound drivers.  As soon as I booted it up and windows updates posted, my sound devices were constantly shutting off.  Since they were working intermittently, I suspected a software issue more than a hardware issue.  I spent quite a bit of time and effort on my own trying to find what was wrong researching it through the internet. Apparently the new drivers for soundcard (realtek) are very poorly written and can result in driver conflicts with other programs.  I also ended up returning the laptop after days of trial and error, but I finally found that if I uninstalled all sound devices and drivers, then let windows use an OLD driver, it worked.  If you see an option to &#34;roll back&#34; the sound driver to an older one, do that...it worked for me.  95% of people would have just given up and returned the computer...but I suspected I would have the same problem if I bought a new one.  Hopefully this helps other people out there if they run into the same problem.  The most disturbing issue?  It came from the factory infested with spyware and malware."
2.0,Ok-not fabulous. Extremely hard to remove iPad from this case.<br />Worked fine but I returned so I can find something that suits my needs.<br />Extremely short charging cord.<br />Easy to set up but I think I want a true charging/keyboard case that only requires one charging cord and allows me to use if no wifi is available.<br />Not a horrible product-just not what I am looking for exactly.
2.0,"1) There is no CAPS LOCK light so I have no idea when CAPS LOCK is on or off, this is especially annoying when typing in a psaaword and getting multiple fails attempting to log on to anything.<br /><br />2) Number pad does not work, it is software driven, not hardware driven so if you are using Linux you do not have a working number pad.<br /><br />3) The SSD is not an SSD, Linux would not install on it because it was not an SSD it was two SSD's that were in RAID. I only learned of this after they had been removed and replaced by a single SSD. If I had know they were in RAID I would have simply removed the RAID and had two SSD's.<br /><br />4) Keyboard back lighting cannot be turned off or adjusted, sometimes it is hard to see my keyboard because it is too bright.<br /><br />I do like the large display and the general look of the unit though."
2.0,"Great size screen, and feel hampered by extremely slow WiFi.  Open the Play Store andvit takes 60 to 90 seconds to load images. Open a weather app and experience clouds over a blank background. Open YouTube and experience 2 minute wait times for videos to load. Nope, it'snot my WiFi signal my other devices work just fine."
2.0,returned not needed
2.0,"Nice bag, very comfy, great pocket. BEWARE of very poor padding and poorly designed constructed strap hooks. The bag is nice, hands down looks great, but the strap constantly comes loos from the hook. It fell off of my shoulder and fell in the parking lot - I did nothing to cause it... my brand new $2,400 Quad i7 MacBook Pro now has a dent in the screen! I am not happy with that, but it services me right as I noticed there was basically zero padding to in the laptop compartment."
2.0,It was good while it lasted<br />it stopped working after a few months
2.0,"I've unfortunately either had really bad luck with this version of Kindle, or it's not as nice as the previous versions.  I recently purchased the Voyage in June 2015, only to have it freeze and quit working not even 2 months later.  Amazon support was very helpful (I used online chat) and I received a &#34;new&#34; Kindle only a few days later.  I just downloaded a few new books to read, only to notice before I could even use it that the top plastic &#34;lining&#34; is ripping off! I've heard rumors they send you refurbished products as replacements.... I'm not sure if this is true, but if it is I'm extremely disappointed.  I just noticed this defect and have not contacted Amazon yet.  Once I do, I hope I am replaced a THIRD time with a brand new, defect free, Kindle Voyage.  I do have to say I have not had the yellow discolored issue as other readers have noticed. Mine just don't work and fall apart lol."
2.0,It works when it wants to.
2.0,Works
2.0,Great picture quality. One of the worst experiences I've had. My old tv from 2009 worked better. It will start flickering to black when playing games and at some points the picture will go out entirely. Planning on returning it.
2.0,When you turn the volume up too much there is a buzzing noise. Also having these on my head for too long hurts my ears. But i knew this was going to suck when i bought it for 10$ so i'm not disappointed.
2.0,under powered and just died last month after about a year of operation antmining.  i replaced it with another brand that has a better power supply I will not buy another of these units
2.0,the cord charges my phone but only at the right angle. its like having my old worn out charger back....
2.0,Worked for 2 weeks then the display died.
2.0,Item doesnt show as many fingerprints but scratches easily and isnt consitently matte. It appears blochie.
2.0,"If you want iTunes, don't get this!  It doesn't support iTunes. I sent it back"
2.0,So much smaller than I thought it would be. It is very difficult to get it to respond. It doesn't work with a touch like my phone... I have to keep tapping it... using a stylus helps a bit but am very disappointed in the response.
2.0,"I just bought this.  It came ahead of schedule! And packaging was great! However the product was not up to par. The lighted portion did not have an attachment, so the &#34;lighted&#34; keyboard is not lighted. And too many of the keys were misplaced. There are no &#34;question, or slash&#34; button, there's no &#34;@&#34; button. Many other buttons were misplaced or missing.  It is a disaster to type!"
2.0,"I felt a little disappointed with it when I first opened it. The color was a little off, which wasn't a huge deal, but it just had a weird feel to it and the zippers seemed to be low quality. But the straps seemed to be durable and it had a lot of pockets, so I felt like I could deal with it. I took it to work the first day; I didn't stuff it, but I did fill it up.Halfway through the day, I looked down and saw that the outside material had split along the height of one of the sides and the lining was exposed. Not only did it look horrible, but I decided to buy this one mostly because it was waterproof; It isn't waterproof anymore if the material is split. Luckily, Amazon has an amazing return process so I sent it back."
2.0,Paint chips ez but they last for a while
2.0,wireless feature will not work but plug it into a cord and that's okay. But I got it for the wireless feature. So it was a bad purchase.
2.0,"Might be a good case but i wont be using this, I ordered what i thought would be a bright yellow and it came as a gross orange color, i'll be returning. Dont trust the color on the screen!"
2.0,"It was damaged, I was ignored."
2.0,"The outlet plug does not stay in the charger at all, it falls right out if it so much as gets moved, had to not only tape it in but at an angle because unless its jammed in just right it won't work<br /><br />disappointing for the price, I feel like I should have just gotten a cheaper fake one"
2.0,it didnt work with my mouse.
2.0,"I really liked the case when I first received it, but I had it for less than a week and already the paint is coming off. I am really disappointed."
2.0,was hoping that you could use the USB port on the tablet while charging no go defeats the purpose of wireless charging.  Sent it back.
2.0,"Good afternoon. I had expectations that I came across the complete purchase, but must inform you that I missed one (1) Kingston 8GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory"
2.0,Bought to play mp3's in my 2005 Blaupunkt head unit. Could not get files to play despite following Blaupunkt's instructions.
2.0,"Some keys are already wearing out and not functioning till you hit them really hard.<br />No cover on to and the iPad slips off the keyboard even though there are some magnets to hold it in place but since there is no cover, both the iPad and keyboard never stays together in the bag.<br />The bottom of the keyboard is getting scratched because there are no pads/ protection when you keep the keyboard on the table/ desk.<br />Connectivity is good and it takes less than a second for iPad to find the keyboard once it's paired properly. Pairing was very easy and fast so 5 stars for that.<br />Looks are good but still the design needs a little more work e.g. Adding some cusion pads/ protection for the bottom surface of the keyboard.<br />Overall I am still not happy with it."
2.0,"I really like the keyboard and mouse. However, the battery just died on me and I purchased it only 6 months ago. I thought the description said last for 18 months for mouse and 3 year for keyboard. This is not the case."
2.0,It says dod military but doesn't work most of the time on dod websites
2.0,"The tablet was good until I noticed it takes 7 hours to charge. I'm going to complain, maybe I received the wrong charger"
2.0,Didn't allow me to do as I liked
2.0,Awaiting delivery
2.0,The D-Pads' right and down buttons were not functioning properly. There is also a very annoying squeaking noise coming from the right analog stick every time I rotate it. Can't say I would recommend this controller.
2.0,It was so so so hard to put this on my MacBook screen without air.
2.0,"Fan itself (motor, bearing, and blades) works great. Frame is a great idea, but...not so durable. Be careful when handling, and don't separate the rubber pins, you'll never get it back together. I'd have returned it but I tossed the boxes for them, so the fan got tossed too. Oh well. To replace them I bought the same brand but regular solid frame. Should have in the first place."
2.0,hard to smooth out
2.0,"I do not recommend this headset (Microsoft LifeChat LX-6000). Here's why.. The audio controller on the cord causes the audio to crackle. The cord is a stiff plastic so it will crack in time. Also, the microphone level is weak with it cranked to 100%.<br /><br />I've used different headsets over time and these are not designed well at all."
2.0,"I like the idea of this better than the actual item. The joints all require adjustment frequently to hold the position. Each joint requires a different sized tool, all of which are included, but still a bit of a pain."
2.0,quit working after about a year
2.0,"I know I can't be the only one but I bought a few of these to setup a network, I found that they were extremely sensitive to any movement and I had to constantly re-seat them.  Purchased the blue ones and no more re-seating necessary."
2.0,"Didn't work for me...I'm extremely careful with this sort of project but I could never get the multiple, smart bubbles out. I cleaned the screen very careful before appling the film but to no avail. The slight loss of detail clarify wasn't a problem but the bubbles drove me nuts. Both screen protectors now reside in the rubbish bin. The shipping was excellent and the online instructions are good. I wish this product had worked but it did not. I hesitate to recommend."
2.0,We are not able to use because we have A T & T. We tried all different ways to make it work but it just can't work. I did not know that I only had 30 days to return this item. I really would like to return it since I am not able to use it. Please contact me so we can work out something.
2.0,It's great when it works. The wireless degrades constantly. I have to reboot it at least weekly and generally multiple times before my devices will reconnect.
2.0,This is not Quirky. It's a Chinese knockoff with an intense rubber smell. It's more or less the right shape and weight as Quirky.
2.0,"Well what can I say I thought I bought this new, and when I got it all put in it was making horrible grinding sounds. Long story short these &#34;new&#34; hard drives are just drives that have had all the data removed on them. my hard drive itself had over 25000 hours hours on working time (three years) so I guess it would be an awesome drive it it was genuinely new."
2.0,"Like many others, I purchased this cable incorrectly because the seller neglected to show a photo of the input and most would assume it's the same type as the output Y-end. I'm sure it works fine for its intended use, but the picture is misleading"
2.0,"The wrist rest on this keyboard is not high/big enough, leaving your wrists bent too much to be ergonomic. Also, hate that it has the extra keypad which then requires your mouse to be very far to the right which is very bad ergonomics. Better off getting the Kinesis Freestyle. Best ergonomics I've found."
2.0,"Finally arrived after two long weeks of me being headsetless.<br />After they arrived i had quite high expectations, the box was good, i heard good reviews about how comfortable they were, and how good they sounded.<br />PROS:They sent me the MSI gaming series version(not sure if it was a mistake or if everyone gets it)<br />and they look pretty<br />CONS:They are quite UNCOMFORTABLE, they are over ears, but do not fully cover, as parts of it do not touch skin, and the headband takes quite some getting use to, as normally i would put on a headset, then adjust instead of just putting it on and leaving it as is.<br />The SOUND QUALITY ISN'T that GREAT either, I've bought a few 5$ earbuds that sound better than these do.<br />So far I have only used this to watch anime, and youtube videos<br /><br />PS:Haven't used it for a game yet<br />Also havent used the mic yet.<br /><br />TLDR:Not that comfortable, doesnt sound too great for videos, disappointed, rather get Logitech g230's"
2.0,It not for a MarAir
2.0,It's great then it starts to chip on the edges. Since February I am on my second one and it chipping. The poor thing sits on the end table waiting for me to look something up. I would say go with another brand.
2.0,The strap broke on the first use....was disappointed. I had specifically bought it for the shoulder strap
2.0,So cheap looking probably only took 50¢ to make so don't get this one there's a 4$ one with fee shipping exactly the same this is not worth $12 I regret everything.
2.0,it didnt work that well for me.  wouldnt work on a mouse pad.
2.0,The bottom portion of the case fits very well and snaps into place.  The keyboard cover is alright but it blocks all the backlight from the keyboard since the letters on the keys are black and not clear like the keyboard cover that I had in the past.  The top cover that should snap on tightly like the bottom cover just will not snap into place and keeps coming off.  I'm worried if I were ever to accidentally drop my MacBook it would fall of and not offer any protection whatsoever.  I'm not sure if the issue is just a defect in what was shipped to me or if this is the quality of this product.  For the $12 it's not worth my effort to return the product at my cost.  Disappointing
2.0,It glitches alot as in it will turn in to a white screen but it ends up working and to day the on \off button pushes in and became loose so its nearly impossible it and sometimes it  opens apps Randomly and starts to glitch when typing
2.0,"Good for the minimalist who would like to broadcast quickly to TV or for presentations. Latest driver updates prevent high resolutions to be displayed. Locked at 720p. Bought intending to use with interactive projector, but does not recognize adapter as PC so did not work. There are certainly limitations."
2.0,"A decent sleeve but much too big for my carbon x1 gen 2, so I returned it. I got a Targus leather (faux?) sleeve instead that fits perfectly."
2.0,"While the drive functions as advertized and seems well built, the one I recieved had the packaging opened with a razorblade. I suspected that someone along the line removed the drive and installed malware. I used it anyway because I didnt have time to wait for a replacement and I wasnt using on a system with any important information, but still you would think they would at least inspect the packages before they ship them.<br /><br />I did not find any virus, however I've heard of malware being written into the firmware of flash drives where it is very difficult to detect or remove."
2.0,Charge doesn't last long
2.0,This would be a great product if it didn't constantly chip and crack. I have never dropped my computer yet there are multiple cracks in this case. I would return but it's not longer eligible for returns.
2.0,I think my memory card came with some pictures and videos already on it??!?? Looks like some guy playing around with his camera in a hotel room? CREEPY!
2.0,"This laptop has a CPU which is capable of Virtulization, but Lenovo has blocked that feature.<br />Also it has a BIOS lock, that mean, you cannot upgrade any of the component.<br /><br />I have same laptop bought from bestbuy. Mentioning the drawbacks just for folks who like to have virtulization ON and allow wifi card to be upgraded after purchase."
2.0,Doesn't smell like the other reviews so that's a plus. This case is way too slippery. There is no grip when I'm holding it and it feels like my tablet is going to slip through my hands. It fits nicely and looks great but unfortunately I'll need a case that is more rubbery for grip.
2.0,"My leased ARRIS TWC modem/router combo is faster. This modem was not worth the upgrade for my situation. The signal throughout my house was also weaker as measured by a 10 minute walkaround comparison test (front yard, garage, opposite side of house different floor, etc...). The ARRIS TWC modem gave equal or slightly better results. I expected more from this modem. Sitting 3 feet away from the router I get 330 Mbps down using wired (as expected with my TWCMaxx300), 15 Mbps on 2.4ghz, and 25 Mbps on 5ghz-N. I have not tested AC speeds yet.  My leased Arris would get me 40 Mbps down on 2.4g and 100 Mbps down on 5ghz-N. I have ensured that the settings in the router are adequate and optimized for the receivers I am using. I expected this router to at least outperform the leased ARRIS router that TimeWarnerCable provides, but sadly this is not the case. Perhaps my situation/house/equipment/interference is unique. YMMV."
2.0,It worked well for about a month then my girlfriend broke it. Keep in mind this made cheaply and will break easily if you are not gentle with it. I got it for the gym I goto since they use the Apple connectors and I have the G4.
2.0,"I've gone through 3 of these with my HTPC.  I love the layout, functionality, etc.  They have no durability, and are buggy.  Parts break, sometimes the mouse just stops working.  You have to switch the mode on it, press some buttons, switch back, and then it starts working again.  The top right section of keys has become very difficult to use... you have to press the buttons HARD to get them to work.  I wish there was another solution that was as aesthetically pleasing and functional as this, because I'd never buy it again.  Logitech- you are a HUGE tech company.  Can't you get it right?"
2.0,"It will work fine for about 20 minutes (5GHz band) then drops connection.  After approximately 2 minutes, it reconnects.  The 2.4GHz band seems to have no problem.  Running Windows 7pro x64.<br /><br />What I have done so far<br /><br />Latest drivers from Netis website.<br />Tried different USB ports on my system<br />Fresh install of Windows 7pro sp1 x64 (all MS updates applied)<br /><br />Routers I am using<br />Asus RT-AC66U (2.4GHz & 5GHz)<br />AT&T Uverse Gateway (2.4GHz only)<br /><br />I had been using a TP-LINK Archer T4UH AC1200 that I moved to my wifes computer when I bought the Netis.  No problems with the TP-Link<br /><br />The problem ONLY happens when running on the 5GHz band.  I have no dropped connections while using 2.4GHz band.<br /><br />No response from Netis support."
2.0,It was a very cute design but it began to tear and rip within three days of using it. I didn't even have any textbooks or heavy materials in it once. The cheap material will not last even if you manage to get passed three days. I would definitely not waste your money.
2.0,"I bought mine the other day and it came in the mail quickly. I immediately liked it, although the end (the touch screen part) is not attached to anything. It is literally a microfiber tip attached to a little plastic screw that is too small to screw into the part it is suppose to. I would return it, but I don't have time to wait around for another one, so I bought some superglue and glued the little thing to where it was suppose to screw in. I would not buy this again, as the very first one I got was defective."
2.0,"Not as durable as I hoped. Its very soft and I can't see it protecting much fron a fall or drop so I kept the styrofoam inside that came with it. It gets dirty rather quickly so I wouldn't get it in a color,  I should've gotten black. Overall just a regular carrier. Something I should've gotb from 5 and below. NOT WORTH 25 DOLLARS!"
2.0,I could not get this mobo to obtain video. Tried all basic troubleshooting as well as some final advanced steps with no success. Tried a different motherboard from a different maker and pc booted up perfectly fine with no extra steps required. Dissapointed since I was looking forward to using this board.
2.0,"This laptop came with a sticky W key, which is very annoying when you play 3D shooters with WASD keys. W sticks and gets stuck for about half a second, then unsticks with a bit of a rubber sound. I returned the 1st laptop and got replacement from Amazon (Amazon was great!). The 2nd laptop came with the same defect. All keys are OK, but W is sticky. Not sure how Asus tries to position it as a &#34;gaming laptop&#34; when one of the most important keys is broken. Not sure what to do next... return probably. Also, the laptop comes with lots of crapware including one known &#34;antivirus&#34;... Asus should be ashamed to sell this subpar laptop for that much money."
2.0,"Not for Mac OS-X 10.6.<br /><br />I searched and tried drivers, none worked. Not able to connect on my older Mac Pro. Searching for compatible device."
2.0,The white beads inside the cushion portion started spilling out along a seam.  I had to superglue an edge to keep it from losing all its filling.
2.0,Doesn't have wrist rest capability so you can't rest your wrist without making a mark.  Finer point makes it easier to input because strokes are better recorded.
2.0,It is definitely not for 15.6&#34; I have dell 7000 series and it did not fit the whole screen. it is short vertically as well as horizontally.  it is more like 13.3'.
2.0,"Ordered two of these tablets, one for each my children.  For the price I was pleasantly surprised. The performance and battery life are better than expected. I understand the screen resolution and quality are as good as its going to get for the price, but it is worth noting the colors are very washed out, and the viewing angle is very limited. If you aren't looking straight on it is difficult to see the screen. But again, its totally usable, especially for a child this could be a perfect tablet.<br /><br />The one major issue is the firmware that is shipped with the unit contains a bug that basically prevents you from using the built in storage. You can't even update the built in apps without running out of space! Now the manufacturer has released a firmware update that should fix this problem, however the software needed to install the firmware update doesn't want to run on my windows 10 computer.<br /><br />I will update this if the manufacturer finds a way to help me get the firmware updated."
2.0,Pretty cheap. I was rather disappointed in the quality of this item. I would rather have the access point exposed than use this. Returning.
2.0,"Received March 26th 2015, stopped working on August 28 2015. Lasted 5 months 2 days. I expected more."
2.0,Very low end but cheap so it works
2.0,Not leather.
2.0,Scratched all on back of panel screen fine
2.0,"I suppose you get what you pay for - latch that gives item a stand broke first day, lol<br />The rest is good for protecting though"
2.0,not good
2.0,the screws don't fit the back box.  Had to go out and purchase all new screws to have it fit in both plastic and metal back boxes.  Not work the savings.
2.0,"I'm using this hub on an iMac.  For about a week it worked flawlessly.  It would go to sleep when I turned the iMac off and when I turned it back on it would wake up.  Since I have my keyboard plugged into it that is the way I need it to work.  After the first week it won't wake up when I turn the iMac on, therefore I can't logon because my computer doesn't see the keyboard.  The iMac starts a search for wireless keyboards which is, of course unsuccessful.  Meanwhile I have to disconnect and reconnect the power supply to get the hub to wake up.  Who knows what will stop working next week?  Thinking of returning it, but returns are such a hassle.  I really expect products to work and to continue to work and find it incredibly frustrating when they don't.  By the way, I bought two of these and so far my wife's still operates as expected with her iMac - maybe I'll just switch them when she isn't home ;)  For now everything else seems fine.  When I plug my iPhone into one of the high current ports it charges rapidly and syncs at the same time.  If it just weren't for this one issue I would be giving it five stars."
2.0,Poor quality. Returned for a refund.
2.0,very slow but you would expect for that price
2.0,"The edges are slightly sharp and the keyboard is a bit too spaced out. The display is decent, but nothing to write home about. What is really lacking is the touchpad. It is barely responsive. The left-and right-click buttons take a lot of force to respond as well. The sound quality was  pretty good at first but now after 6 months there is a constant crackling and popping sound. Windows 10 is extremely problematic, the only good thing is that start up is quick."
2.0,"I have a similar experience to the other MacBook owners reviewing this product. It does not provide enough power to both charge the MacBook and connect to an external hard drive. A partial workaround I have found is to plug a powered USB hub into this hub and connect the drive to that. This works for some of my external drives but not all. I'd recommend avoiding this product for the new MacBook.  EDIT: In researching this more, it turns out it may not be the hub's fault. Instead, the culprit may be the 29W charger that Apple includes with the MacBook. In reading reviews (on Apple's website) of the $79 hub that Apple sells, it seems people have similar issues. The solution may be to purchase a higher wattage Type C charger, such as the one that Google sells (search for Google Universal Type-C Charger 60W).  EDIT 2: I went ahead and purchased the Google charger because I wanted a second charger anyway and it is actually very nice. Unfortunately, it is not a magic bullet for this hub. While it does seem to work marginally better, something is still going on inside the hub that is making it disconnect intermittently. I'd recommend avoiding this hub for use with the new MacBook."
2.0,"When I have a stable internet connection, this computer works as expected, but the offline capabilities of Chrome OS have been greatly exaggerated.  I wasn't expecting much beyond offline word processing, but it can't even do that reliably.  Files will disappear and reappear at random, and edits are sometimes lost if you close the document before syncing.  I know the computer is intended primarily for online use, but I was expecting more than an shiny black brick offline."
2.0,"Ordered this to replace a dead hdd in my 2010 MacBook Pro 15&#34;. The disk functioned fine for a short time before beginning to make random screeching and clicking noises alarmingly often. Their frequency increased until I replaced the disk with an identical replacement which has since exhibited the same problem. I don't recommend this particular model disk for a main internal drive, and will be switching to an ssd."
2.0,"I had this to extend the wifi in my 1,200 sq ft. Apartment and the wifi has not improved with the extender. I'm giving it 2 stars because I do have full wifi bars with the extender but the connection is still terrible."
2.0,I thought I would save some money on trying this device compared to others that would allow me to Miracast from my phone to TV. IT started off fine. Plugged right up and connected to phone but it doesn't stream effortlessly and has glitches for what I'm using it for. I primarily bought this device to stream games that I play on my phone to my TV. Not doing as well as I had liked. Will try a Belkin next.
2.0,Didn't like having to take the tablet out of the bottom of the cover to stand the tablet up to use.
2.0,I sold it to a friend.  I prefer the nook format.  The Kindle is to nook as the i-phone is to android.  Too many rules.
2.0,"Don't like this at all! It falls over easily! Only has one position, not easy to use keyboard. I am buying a Snugg."
2.0,"The wire wears at the plug in at the IPad, after just a few week."
2.0,This case not only was NOT LEATHER even though it was advertised as such. After a few months it started coming apart between the layers of &#34;leather&#34;.
2.0,Stops working after 2 weeks... It will not charge any more!  Dud!
2.0,"I bought this laptop and it was amazing for the first week. However, after a week, I started having issues with the built-in microphone. I updated my drivers using the Drivers Update software that Aorus provides, and the laptop completely lost sound. Even after reformatting, it wouldn't work. Amazon provided me with a replacement, and this new laptop came with a faulty trackpad. Whenever I left/right click on this trackpad, I have to push it down real hard for it to register the click. This was not the case on the first laptop they sent.<br /><br />Amazon is willing to replace the laptop again, but I'm a bit skeptical about the quality of Aorus now and am considering getting a refund and moving onto a different brand. I've lost so much time waiting for the new laptop, installing all my programs again, and shipping the laptop for return."
2.0,"I have been using this portable drive for about a month now and the drive does not stay connected when plugged into my computer.  It constantly goes from &#34;drive connected&#34; to &#34;drive disconnected&#34; even when its stationary and not touched or moved. This is extremely frustrating when I'm trying to install my printer via CD-ROM.  I was hoping it would be as great as the previous reviews suggested, but this was not my experience and cannot recommend this product to anyone."
2.0,"It worked for about an hour, loved the size and key shortcuts... But after an hour, would stop responding. Thought maybe the batteries were dead, put in brand new ones and still no response. Used it on Windows 10 for my Surface Pro 2, but why only work for like an hour? Disappointing :(<br /><br />Returned..."
2.0,Doesn't work with music on windows phone. Error 80070003. I did format to fat32 even when is exFat but i takes 32gb only.
2.0,"My new laptop came in the mail in about 4 days which was very good for free shipping, and the item seemed to be very well packaged. The thing that really aggravates me about this product is that it does not lay flat on a table, the laptop is warped so when you type on it on a flat surface the right sight close to the trackpad bounces up and down. I hope someone from Asus contacts me to resolve this issue because currently I am very disappointed that I was delivered a defective item."
2.0,"Case didn't fit right, so can't close it all the way. Bummer."
2.0,I've had 3 of these in the four years I've had my MB pro.
2.0,Purchased this roughly eight months ago. It has been a great purchase but recently the hinge has started to break. I possibly open the laptop two to three times a day on average as I go about my day and generally haven't had an issue until now. The is a plastic bezel at the bottom of the display that is completely disconnected along with the hinge clearly not functioning properly. Will be requesting some sort of repair to resolve this.
2.0,Just couldn't get it to work.I just don't know....
2.0,mabey it's just the computer but connection is spotty and lots of interference.
2.0,No lighted cover/case available.  Small to hold and if your finger slips the slightest the page changes or the font changes or it sets off the dictionary. ...touchscreen is very sensitive.<br />Not an easily handled device at all.<br />It reads fine. About as good as any other and the battery life is as expected.<br />Overall I am disappointed.<br />Page turner tabs should be an option.  And someplace to actually hold it (more than the 1/2 inch provided)
2.0,"Soon after using it the 4 small black pads underneath, used to prevent sliding, came off. After a year of use parts of the cover have cracked. This product is ok. For the price, you get what you pay for."
2.0,"iPad comes with a charger and damaged cable, and no warranty."
2.0,"While the build quality of the cable itself is good and it feels strong, the cable itself is not good for charging your phone. If you're looking for fast charging cables, definitely look somewhere else."
2.0,"First one I ordered had trouble connecting to my Mac. The replacement connected and worked for 2 weeks, but now the left button works only 50% of the time. Normal indoor use shouldn't cause the button to get stuck this quickly."
2.0,"This is not what I thought I was ordering. That's probably my fault. It would be fine if it had come with a screen protector sheet, but it didn't."
2.0,"This supposedly was easy to install without bubbles, well... *I* coudln't do it.  Spent a LOT of time, and kept trying, and all I ended up doing was scratching the shield, and i was using the enclosed little plastic tool (which is just like a small credit card)  And still had bubbles and now two scratches as well.<br /><br />If I knew where I could get it installed professionally I am sure I would like it much better--I like having a blue blocker on the iPad, and I like this much better than the amber one I have."
2.0,Doesn't cover all the corners of my tablet.
2.0,"Gave it 3 stars. Each star represents the number of bars I get from my router in the next room. The physical distance apart is about 5 ft. Installing it was easy; didn't need to install software for it to work, but I updated the drivers anyway.  Edit: After 6 months, the connection started dropping randomly every few minutes even though the router is in the next room."
2.0,"It's a stunning case, but if you look too sharply at it, you might break it.<br /><br />Retaining tabs are very weak on this case. Once put together, don't expect it disassemble it again. I owned this case for 4 months and took it around as an emulation platform when visiting family (what?!). Once the tab broke it lost its rigidity and I spent more time fidgeting with putting the sides together whenever I moved it around. Now it's making its grand voyage to the dump.<br /><br />If you want a permanent solution (read: to ensure you never disassemble it), use super glue on the tabs to keep them together. Otherwise if you plan on accessing the gpio pins, don't get this case."
2.0,"I can not get it to work on my dell laptop, guess I am not smart enough to load the correct drivers. I have been on intel support and tried the discover software and drivers but still can not connect my router."
2.0,Blue case and keyboard do not match. Case is Aqua and keyboard is baby blue. Disappointed
2.0,DON&#34;T WASTE YOU TIME FOLKS....HONESTLY ONE OF THE WORS LAPTOPS I EVER PURCHASED......
2.0,These are baby slippers. Junk!
2.0,Great for first 8 months then it snapped on side without cause. Now it's uneven and makes a horrible buzzing noise. Junk! Don't waste your money!
2.0,App is useless won't read its own file format doesn't do half the stuff it's supposed to
2.0,It does not recognize my printer
2.0,This comes curled up in shipping and I couldn't get the curl to release and lay flat. Some have tried boiling it in water but I think that's a bit over the top. I was never able to use it.
2.0,"This was a very good card while it lasted. I had it over a year and the middle fan decided to start making a loud noise. FIlled out the warranty info and decided to send it in. WORST IDEA EVER! They not only told me due to shipping damage (The outside corner of the box was dinged very slightly,but I had air shipping pockets inside, plus another box) that they would no longer honor the warranty, but also that the warranty of 3 years was now null and void!!! Gigabyte should be ashamed of how poor their customer service and warranty department is!!!<br /><br />The fan would have cost them max of $5, yet they chose the low road and not to help a very simple, easy warranty claim.<br /><br />I was previously a huge fan of Gigabyte, but now I'll stay away from their products like the plague. They might say they have great warranties, but the reality is that they will figure out a way to not fix your product and blame it on shipping or worse, you!!!"
2.0,Ordered it for a wireless speaker and it didn't work.
2.0,Doesn't hold a charge for very long.
2.0,Chinese crap
2.0,"No range, had to return it and go back to time warner modem and my original router"
2.0,Chinese crap
2.0,"I purchased this cooling stand because it has a similar design to one I previously owned, which I had a great experience with. This one, however, is not so good. I'm sure it cools well enough, but those supports on the front are awful. Cheap plastic, with a thin piece of super-low quality rubber, adhered with equally low-quality glue (which is already starting to wear off on mine). And it's not going to matter how you position the sliding supports; your arm will always rest on one of the square edges, and be uncomfortable the entire time you need to type."
2.0,So unstable when charged and over heat
2.0,"For some reason the receiver is slightly larger than the average nano receiver .   It has trouble working on different surfaces this this could be due to the very old laser design.   The design is reminiscent of the first laser mouses that started showing up on the market 10 years ago, if you look at the laser you can even see it flashing.   But the strangest thing about the mouse is it doesn't seem to work on steam. Could I be the only one having this problem, possibly. Trying to play L4D2 or Payday 2 I find the mouse skips and freeze, it  made playing impossible. I don't understand why that would even happen.   The scroll wheel is almost useless, I'm using a 13.3 inch laptop with 1080 resolution and while scrolling up and down it will jump half the page, HALF THE PAGE! Whatever I was reading, whatever I was doing left me far behind thanks to this wheel. Useless Wheel."
2.0,batterie did not hold a charge longer than 30m but was cheap
2.0,Disappointed with this purchase because I didn't realise it didn't have a motion sensor thing to allow you to play certain games. So I still have to buy an additional adapter for it.
2.0,"It had a textured top, something that wouldn't work for me in this instance."
2.0,After two months of normal use in the car the housing on female end of the cord came apart. It split into two pieces.
2.0,"Left my old Kindle on a plane never to be seen again. I bought the Nexus upon the advice of a friend because I wanted more storage space and the comparable Kindle was more money.  I left on a cruise the day I received it and found out I can't read while outside. I took off the auto bight feature and pumped the screen to brightest but as soon as I turn it on the screen goes from bight to dimmer no matter what I do, Also don't like where the on/off button is, hard to get to with the cover on it.  Size is good, like the ability to take pictures and store them but the reading feature is not nearly as Amazon friendly as the Kindle.  I would return it if I could. UPDATE--April 2017--I got used to the Nexus, even to really enjoy it.  My daughter gave me a Kindle Fire as backup for recipes, but it will not hold a charge so useless unless plugged in.  Now my Nexus quit.  At first I thought it was just the battery but now I'm beginning to believe it's just DOA.  I searched &#34;battery for Nexus 7&#34; to no avail. so I guess I'll researching for the next  mid-priced tablet.  Thoroughly hooked on tablet. reading--Can't live without one."
2.0,Had problems getting the protector on without any bubbles or dust getting underneath despite cleaning the HP7.....when I tried to remove the sticker that tells you which side to put on where it left paper residue that wouldn't come off and is still on there.  The smoother they give you scratched the protector as well.....I have it on there anyway but it's not what I was hoping for.....
2.0,"Be careful when ordering. Apple changed this laptop but didn't change the model number. I have the A1278 early 2011, and this battery is for A1278  2008 .... and now it's too late to return it. Good job, Apple."
2.0,"The card works fine now, but it wouldn't seat properly due to some sort of bracket warping (when the bracket was secured to the case, the card wouldn't seat in the PCI slot).  After having it for a couple of weeks, I noticed my PC was randomly rebooting.  Since I don't sit at my PC often (I just use it to serve media and occasionally remote to it from my iPad), I didn't realize the timing of it coincided with the ownership of the card, so I didn't consider that as a cause initially.  Tonight, however, I noticed that the reboots occurred consistently if something banged the desk or the floor near the PC, leading me to look for loose connections in the PC -- the card was not seated properly still.  I pushed it down to fully seat it in the slot, which required manipulation of the bracket, but now I can bang the desk, the floor and even the PC, and it doesn't reboot itself anymore.  The card seems to be fine now, but the USB 3.0 drive that I had connected to it apparently failed due to the frequent unexpected reboots.  That drive was the only reason I bought this card, but fortunately it was just used for local data backups, so no real data loss....  The drive, on the other hand, is toast.  I can plug other drives into the card and they work fine since the card is in fully seated now.  I'm bummed that this card was not able to remain seated when flush to the rear panel, and had to have the bracket screw removed to allow it to seat correctly, but live and learn...  Update: 9-6-15 -- after having the card in the PC for about a week after the reboots stopped, it started back up again.   This is likely due to my having to open the PC up to take a picture of the card, and causing it to come a bit loose in the slot yet again.  At that point, I removed the card.   Since leaving the original review, Anker support contacted me and was very nice in their willingness to assist.   They offered to replace the card, but I initially declined since the card was seemingly fine after re-seating.   They even refunded me in full for the card, and said I could keep or return it.   They sent me a prepaid shipping label, and I will likely return it so they can inspect it to determine the fault.   Even while removing it from the PC, the card seemed to slip out easily, so clearly there was a defect.   This sort of thing can happen, and the card clearly has great reviews, so I may be one of the few exceptions.   The good news is that my USB drive (and another that disappeared during all of the random reboots) finally started working again, so I lost nothing in the end.   I will consider giving Anker another try down the road, as I am pleased with the company's response to my issue, and willingness to do whatever it takes to rectify it.  I am glad that they were so involved to provide excellent customer service.    Thank you Anker Support.   I wish the product was as good as your support, and hoping I just got a bad card.  I don't expect this is the norm, due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews.   As a result of having to remove the card completely, I have reduced the rating from 3 to 2 stars."
2.0,Bought this pair and they are both flaky. Fine for charging a device if you leave it sitting still but I wouldn't trust it for data transfer.
2.0,"Poor quality, seems like parts were glued together and the part where the volume keys were suppose to go was bent... So I know what last long. Expect a long wait to receive"
2.0,"This is NOT a UL certified cord as the listing claims. There is no UL designation anywhere on it and I looked it over with a magnifying glass including the packaging. I'm afraid to use non-UL electrical stuff in my house and around my family.<br />Underwriters Laboratory (UL) certifies products sold in the USA to be free of fire hazards. Products with UL promise they will not cause a fire under normal use. Of course, what most people don't know is most of the cheap stuff from Asia doesn't have UL but they put all kinds of other symbols and designations on it which are meaningless in the USA.<br />I never thought much about it until I had more than one power cord purchased online that actually did nearly cause a fire, two different laptop power packs. One overheated, but one actually melted and smoked to the point where it was strong smelling and the entire plastic casing melted as it burned up inside,  Fortunately I caught it before it got worse because I was in the room at the time but could have easily burned the carpet or worse. To be fair, this cord in the review is not a transformer type, so there is less risk, but its still unfair for it to be listed as UL certified when it is clearly not. And speaking of fair, Amazon is sending this FBA yet there is no where in the listing to contact them and let them know its not UL, customers have a right to know what they are bringing into their home.<br />I have decided to only use this cord as a backup and not leave it plugged in when I'm not around. 999/1000 people may not have a problem but I don't want to be the one that does, as I've had in the past with other non-UL stuff.<br /><br />If the seller adjusts the description I'll adjust my review.<br /><br />Also, be aware this is a very light duty cord. Its thinner and wimpier than the typical cord of this nature, and lighter weight than the Mac Mini cable for which I bought it. For normal use (since the Mac draws less than 100W) I'm not seeing this as an issue. But depending on the device you are powering its not a bad idea to check the power rating so you aren't in overload. Thanks for reading.ing its not a bad idea to check the power rating so you aren't in overload. Thanks for reading."
2.0,"I bought two of these. The first, purchased in 2013, is still working. The second, purchased in April 2014, lasted 15 months then died. Not sure what went wrong with the second one, but seems to me it should have lasted longer."
2.0,"This is an awesome tablet and I liked it, except mine never worked properly. It kept freezing and not starting and staying lit after I turned it off. As a college student I could not afford to keep an unreliable devise. So I returned it after two and a half weeks."
2.0,"After going through 2 expensive type covers in 2 years with my surface pro, I decided to purchase this, hoping it would be sturdier, plus it's actually cheaper than the regular price type cover. And it has the battery option.<br /><br />But it seems a questionable benefit. As others have noted, the right and left click buttons are practically un-usable, you have to press so hard to get them to work.<br /><br />But the troubling thing is that the type cover battery seems so unpredictable. The first few weeks, it seemed to work okay. But then, I would find it going from a full charge to completely draining itself and the surface pro battery overnight, when the device was supposed to be sleeping. Sometimes I would find it hot to the touch, and the surface pro on.  At times the surface pro battery is so drained, that it can't reboot even when plugged in, and it has to be charged for a day, and go through numerous &#34;repair&#34; cycles.  This has gotten worse since I installed windows 10.  I'm not sure if the two are related, but basically, I can't leave the power cover hooked to the surface pro when the device is meant to be sleeping, because even though all the power settings are properly set, the device will turn on by itself and drain the battery overnight. If I shut down the computer and detach the power cover, then I can unplug it, otherwise, not.<br /><br />I've read all the reviews and see others have noted this issue, that the battery comes on and becomes super hot when the device is supposed to be off. I haven't yet called Microsoft about this, If anyone has any suggestions, I'd welcome them.<br /><br />Otherwise, as a type cover it's okay, except for the terrible track pad, click buttons.  What I find frustrating about this cover is that these devices aren't cheap, the type cover and power cover and AC adaptor aren't cheap, and yet, I've gone through no less than three AC adaptors in less than 3 years and am on my third keyboard cover.  NEver had to replacean AC adaptor on a laptop or tablet before.  Never have had to replace even one keyboard on any laptops in a couple of decades. So hard to understand why Microsoft can't build quality accessories, and also why, given the accessories are so poor, they cost to much to replace.  I got the surface pro because I wanted something to replace a Dell 9&#34; mini netbook, the form factor with something faster. The Pro is faster, but so buggy, and goes through so many accessories that I'm not inclined to replace it with another Pro.  A reason why Microsoft should perhaps either make good accessories, or if they are throwaway, price them accordingly.  Even that doesn't cover the annoyance factor of having to replace them, and then, when you get them, not having them work very well."
2.0,Not reliable source barely used this lab top and believe I have to replace the battery bought a charger twice which by the way are $90 a piece not a smart but just buy the new one
2.0,"I purchased this item in July, 2014. The first 5 months I had this unit it worked as advertised. However, beginning in December it began to drop off on wireless. When it started this it was maybe 3-4 times per week. Now it is daily. The only way to fix it is a hard boot; shut down and reboot. Several calls to Netgear Help line do not help. They are willing to try to adjust the settings but the adjustments do not fix the problem. I would not buy this model again."
2.0,The photos are deceiving this thing is HUGE.  It takes up an incredible amount of space mounting to the edget of the desk.
2.0,I've only had the tablet since Christmas (about 6 months) and it's completely stopped working. It won't turn on or charge or anything. It's completely useless and I feel like I wasted $120. I wish I would have sucked it up and paid the extra for an IPad.
2.0,Cables are so short I am not sure it can be used with tower computers on the floor.  Almost will need to be on the desk
2.0,Drive failed after a year and a half.  Would not buy again.  Glad I didn't trust it with anything valuable.
2.0,Had them hooked to a satellite radio. They worked well for that purpose but I managed to blow the woofer out already.  Speakers without it are pointless.
2.0,Could get ip address up. Could not use it.used an older version
2.0,"Setup required a wireless computer that I did not have.  I can't say if it worked or not, since I returned it."
2.0,I was very disappointed because the number board stopped working after a couple of weeks and the space bar  doe not work the first time you hit it so I have a lot of errors that I have to go back and fix
2.0,The strap can become unclipped so that the iPad goes flying across the room when you carry it.
2.0,I have only had it since April and it's now August and the left clicker is already sticking and difficult to push.
2.0,"I am most displeased with this mouse. We bought 2 of them and both have HORRIBLE BATTERY LIFE!  We've tried multiple types of batteries and all are awful battery life in this mouse. It's the mouse that is a bad design. I've tried multiple times to get support from logitech to get them to replace the mouse and their support has simply stated maybe I used the mouse too much.  That's pathetic.<br /><br />I give a 2 star as the mouse works ok, when it's working.  We change batteries once a week in this mouse.  Our previous Logitech Mk 550 mouse would stay charged for months. This mouse is about a week or so. It's pathetic! Get a different one."
2.0,"Not what I expected, not enough instructions."
2.0,Even though the light is green for signal strength i would me lucky to get 100 MBs.
2.0,The LED's behind several keys have already started to fail.<br />Won't be buying another corsair keyboard
2.0,Many problems - I should have spent more money on a NEW computer; I might through it away.
2.0,"Doesnt have the right about of drive and slow, and graphic card isnt that good"
2.0,"Slow, small, and unresponsive. Compared to my 2013 Kindles (2), this was a let down."
2.0,"This was a huge dissapointment!!!  The computer came just fine.  However,  after few hours of operation a crack in the screen started to show.  Called Lenovo and got &#34;cold answer&#34; like : it's your fault,  and it is a physical danage not included in the warranty.<br />Sent it to theil lab to repair and already 2 weeks past and no action was taken.  I had another one just like this in Israel fir one of my workers and,  the screen is blinking after you open it.  It looks like something is wrong with the way they Assemble the screen and it just wouldn't work.  It is a super expensive computer and it is the sconed time it is not working out of the box.  Lenovo has problem with this computer that they do not admit and do not take responsibility.<br />Also,  international warranty???  Don't waste your time on this.<br />To sum the issue : find another high end computer and don't waste your time on thus one"
2.0,"I ordered this SSD drive on 10/26/2015, and it arrived by 10/27/2015 through the free one-day delivery, which I am very happy about. However, after I connected it to my laptop's USB port through a USB-to-SATA cable, the SSD drive was not recognized by Samsung Data Migration application that comes with the product. I am very disappointed. Probably I just got a defective drive, but I am returning it because I don't want to take any chance since I am going to replace my system drive (a smaller SSD drive) with the new SSD drive."
2.0,it does not fit my hard drive ( seagate wireless plus) although it was recommended to by them together !!
2.0,"The case does not fit correctly, the edges are not smooth like they should be, and the corners are just plain ugly (as shown in the picture taken just after I got it in the mail). Long story short: this case is super cute but poorly made."
2.0,"Ithe case wont fit into my macbook, the size delivered was way too small... devastated...."
2.0,couldn't get it to work
2.0,"Broke after one use. Customer service, well it took awhile, but they have decided I have a faulty cable. They are sending one, said it would take 5 business days.. for a brand new drive...  not cool. If it isn't the cable, then we will see, its still under warranty. PS if you have a Mac as I do you will need to run Disk Utility to format it for Mac. Something it neglects to state in the &#34;dots&#34;."
2.0,Inexpensive and worth the price if you're careful.  They aren't the most durable though.  :( I purchased 2x and both broke within 2 months.  Compared to my galaxy tabs they're not worth it.
2.0,"I gave this laptop two stars because the system came with a missing key, and after a short period of use the other keys started to feel as though they were about to flake off. Just shy of a month later the numpad keys started to fall off if pressed in the top right corner. The other reason why I give this system such a low rating is because the GPU is throttled at 74c by default. I had to install the latest beta bios that increased the throttling to 81c. That may not seem like much in temperature but it is a huge jump in performance. Some games such as FFXIV went from 720p 40-60fps after 15 minutes of play to solid 60 fps at 1080p. Grand Theft Auto 5 also had a HUGE jump in FPS!!!<br /><br />I got this laptop for gaming and for school and I wasn't willing to take risks so I ended up getting a Macbook Pro 2015 retina laptop instead and it actually feels like a premium laptop I was desiring."
2.0,I don't believe this is any percentage of leather.  Much lighter and less substantial that I expected.  This is going to be a backup.
2.0,"Did not work as  expected - when you plug two devices into it (like a Bluetooth receiver and a Wifi receiver) it keeps alternating between them, essentially looking like it deactivates /reactivates each alternately."
2.0,I've had this case for only a few weeks and the case has already cracked.
2.0,"Product consists of two light strips that are about 1 foot or 15 inches long. The LEDs are close together which was great but the build quality was not good. They form a loop and the connectors that connect each are not well marked as to polarity, dont get me wrong its there but not easy to see all. In addition the quality of the connections was not good and each strip is made of 3 LED's per segment and 6 segments total. one my segments was damaged and would go out or change color differently from the rest of the strip.  All in all I chose a refund over a replacement as I think this is just not a very well made product."
2.0,Great
2.0,There was absolutely no paperwork that came with the product. That was very disappointing.
2.0,"Not what is pictured.  This is a micro to micro extension, NOT a micro to SD extension.  I managed to get it to work, but just be warned."
2.0,"You get what you pay for, and that is true for this drive as well. I bought four. One was DOA, one showed 115GB and the two others that were OK got worryingly warm when I copied data onto them. I would not recommend these for long-term use. They're slower than other USB 3.0 drives that I've used and I have to question their reliability."
2.0,"It didn't work. Yeah it's cool to look at, but it didn't last more than 2 months"
2.0,"I just received these yesterday. Good price for three to them. Nicely paca pages to prevent damage. Received the. As promised in 2 days (I'm a Prime member).<br /><br />I bought these cords for my older iPad and iPhone 4 (that we let the kids use to play games). Plugged it in and everything appeared to charge without any problems.<br /><br />When I unplugged the cord from my ipad, the casing came off and exposed the internal components.  I have put the casing back on, but now that it has come off, I am pretty sure it will happen frequently if not all the time. I'll just use the other 2 and cross my fingers that they don't do the same.<br /><br />While I am disappointed with the quality of the cord, it still charges, which is why I did not give it a 1 star. But given the fact that i cant let my kids use these cords because of the electronic components being exposed makes the product a solid 2 star at best.<br /><br />Maybe I got a defective cord. I know that it's impossible to have 100% QA. Lastly, other than the casing, everything appears to be quality (the cord is thick - like the original apple cords. They are not the thin - cheap cords."
2.0,"Venue 11 Pro 7130 I5.  Great design, quality material, fit was tight and secure.  However, if you put the tablet in as shown in the picture, the charging port was blocked, and if you flipped it, the &#34;Windows&#34; button and cooling vents were blocked.  Completely un-usable for the 7130 I5.  This could have been a fantastic product as everything about it is quality.  It just doesn't fit the intended tablet.  Unfortunately, I had to return it."
2.0,Poor air flow for it's size.  The smaller model AI-MPF80A  works much better.
2.0,"It worked great for about a month, then my laptop said that I had to service it. So I was like what the damn!? Doesn't make sense."
2.0,"Be careful of the colors, they are nothing like they are online. They are washed out and faded and nowhere near as vibrant"
2.0,Nice wose but quality no so best one! Better turtles beach
2.0,"Bubbles, bubbles bubbles.  I can't get rid of them.  Easy to install, but lots of bubbles."
2.0,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking begins its configuration with a volume and clarity test of the microphone. This microphone failed both tests repeatedly even after extensive fine tuning of the HD sound card controls in this Windows 7 Asus x54c notebook. The microphone was plugged into the audio input jack as opposed to the USB port. ( there are two different models of this microphone... ) Perhaps the USB model is superior to the audio jack model, but I did not try that one out. Or maybe the Asus sound card is inferior. But the VXI Blue Parrot Xpressway bluetooth mic configured perfectly on the first try and performs extremely well."
2.0,"Absolutely awesome looking, colors are bright and the mouse is really sleek.  I'm not sure if I got a bum mouse or what, but the wireless connection kept dropping on me. I eventually switched back to a corded mouse."
2.0,"The card is fine, just a warning:<br />It doesn't work with the Polaroid Cube camera."
2.0,Great for about 2 weeks.  Started to smell like burning plastic and got really warm.
2.0,"No even close to iPad, but for reader it works fine."
2.0,"This case appears to be pretty low quality also the color is not as pictured. This is definitely not as vibrant and pretty at the hot teal shown, I will most likely return.. not satisfied."
2.0,Regret buying.
2.0,Wire cracked after two weeks of use at a desk. Wire does not work.
2.0,"Bought the Archer C9 from Amazon and returned it the following day. It has good reviews and all, but didn't work for me. Router was fast nearby, but at 40 ft, it was dropping the signal, and about 50 ft away from it, my devices couldn't find the router. I tried relocating it to a more open area, positioning the antennas at different angles and directions, but didn't help. It pretty much had the same range as my 6 year-old Linksys router that doesn't have any exterior antennas. I was very disappointed. Too bad, it was a nice looking router."
2.0,Powerline link not as stable as other brands I have used.
2.0,I was disappointed with this purchase for one reason only. While it was easy to install I was left with a sticky residue on my screen in one coroner which frustrates me. Other than that it is fined.
2.0,"Doesnt seem to work on my OSX mac or my Raspberry PI, only works on Windows."
2.0,"On paper this device is amazing, IRL, this is a disappointment. When in the menu the Burton commands from the included are recognized only 10% of the time, even after eliminating any interfering light sources, and changing the distance from the box. The device also constantly changes source even when only input source is connected to it, which stops the recording and when in game play is more then annoying. I wanted to like this box, but due to the issues mentioned, I can't recommend Antoine but it. Update: I just updated the firmware to 1.1.9 and the menu was more responsive but eventually provided the same frustrations. Anyone looking to purchase an external capture device I would recommend something like the El Gato devices which based on reviews seen to have less of these problems."
2.0,Only thing I use from this is the case and the laptop fabric case.<br />The screen protector was cheap and had too many bubbles to apply properly. No matter what I did. Also the keyboard protector has a weird residue on it I'm guess because of what it is made out of. But I don't trust it to touch my screen when the laptop is closed. So I just don't use it.<br /><br />The plastic case.... The bottom was cracked when I received it. But I didn't have the time to order a new one I needed a case ASAP. The top part was fine. Some imperfections in the manufacturing but just cosmetic issues like as if it is dented a bit. But the main problem is the crack on the bottom part.<br /><br />The laptop fabric cover (sleeve) is great. Doesn't fit too snug but it isn't too loose either. Easy to get your laptop in and out.
2.0,"Fit: the fit is nice and no loose ends<br />Color: the color is NOT white, or for that matter clean, the color is uneven as there are some random dark grey lines running though the keys. It makes it look as if the keyboard cover is water marked. On top of that the whole keyboard appears silver, its as if my keyboard just blends in with the silver plating of the mac. NOT WHITE COLOR, if you would like a silver skin cover then this is for you!"
2.0,tips wear out too fast and you can't get your screen to move even while pressing down hard with the instrument
2.0,Keyboard and touch pad not user friendly; too spaced put

2.0,Las esquinas golpeadas
2.0,"I bought this as replacement for a Samsung Galaxy Tab kids edition for a special needs young adult.  The things it WON'T do using FreeTime are ludicrous.<br /><br />NO option to access our prime music?????<br /><br />Runs out of storage space quickly, and turns off the WIFI.  BUT it needs WIFI to accept a PIN to open the account for archiving items.<br /><br />We bought it a month or two ago for a birthday and are getting rid of it in favor of another Galaxy Tab."
2.0,"Kept dropping connections, and the 'beam-forming' never seemed to work. Sent back."
2.0,Very cheap and flimsy. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"The problem is more Window 7, that piece of s*** operating system that came with it. Slow as molasses with no added programs except for security software needed because of,,,,,,,,,,Windows being s***. Why sell a new computer with that operating system?"
2.0,"Like the mount and worked great for 8 months, EXCEPT... When I was pulling the unit back down after having it folded up against the cabinet, the grommet that holds the mount in the arm broke off. Can't be fixed. Sad day."
2.0,Flimsy. I returned it.
2.0,I hate this pen!  It does not record the audio unless it is paired with a tablet or smartphone.  The Echo is a much better pen and also it can record audio without another devise.  I do not recommend it.
2.0,It worked one day then not at all on another; still does not work
2.0,Too fragile.
2.0,doesn't work will not copy any dvds period. always says not enough space!
2.0,"The wrist rest was a great size and height, but this keyboard is massive. Why do so many keyboards have 2 keypads anyways? They would do way better to get rid of the one on the right which would allow your mouse to be there (more ergonomic!) instead. I ended up with a Kinesis Freestyle keyboard for this reason (no extra keypad!)"
2.0,"Did not function out of the box, and even interfered with my router to the point that my wife's laptop would drop in and out of Wi-Fi (the only hardware change I made was to remove this switch and put in another one and everything was fine). There were no instructions pointing to the need to perform any kind of setup, so I'm assuming it should've worked out of the box. Ended up returning to Amazon."
2.0,"keys stick, very flexible.  takes several attempts to get the keys to type what you want.  pretty poor quality from start to finish.  the led colors are nice."
2.0,Memory became corrupt after trying to write a lot of files over!
2.0,"I received the RAM quickly, but 1 set of ram was defective. The company was great and replaced it with no problems.  If not for having to send it back and get one replaced, it was a good buy.  The trouble of taking the laptop apart, paying to mail the ram back, and reinstalling the replacement ram was the reason for 2 stars. The ram works great."
2.0,"The magnetic keyboard doesn't stay put and after getting everything connected I had no wifi. Passed the return date, very dissapointed."
2.0,"I want to love this unit, but it just would not work properly for me. I bought this to replace a Nighthawk X6 R8000 and a Motorola Modem and I had nothing but problems with it. 1) I could not successfully get a device I needed to forward ports to to work properly. Since I have a Nighthawk, I know my way around Netgear's firmware - so I knew exactly what to do. The AC1900 just would not work properly. According to the unit's UI I had it set up properly - alas, I could not get it working.<br /><br />With the Nighthawk X6 R8000 port forwarding worked perfectly.<br /><br />2) My Sonos system (which is hard wired into my network) kept stopping.<br />The stream(s) would just quit. With the Nighthawk I would run audio for DAYS without any interruptions. Not so here.<br /><br />I thought ok, maybe I need to update the firmware - guess what?<br /><br />You can't. Because it's a combo device, Comcast needs to certify / release any new firmware. You know what that means right?<br /><br />They're never going to to do. They have no incentive.  They don't care.<br /><br />I like that I was able to to future proof my cable modem speeds, but not at the incredible expense of network that would not work properly AND firmware that most likely will never be upgrade.<br /><br />Very sad."

2.0,"I purchased this item as a supplement to my Unbranded Tablet. It works as intended, and I find the trackpad is the perfect size for the tablet, though I have read that some were complaining about it. The battery life is excellent, though I haven't used it too much. I like how the base is steel, so it happens to actually attach to the bottom of the case I have it in, another unexpected plus. The keys are almost perfect size, though I do wish they were a tad larger. So far, I've had far better luck with this keyboard than some previous Jelly Comb keyboards that simply ceased to connect after a while.  UPDATE: the keyboard has ceased function as of 2/5/16: it refuses to pair, while my Microsoft Bluetooth mouse still pairs properly. It was great while it lasted."
2.0,"the few i tried only had one side that would connect to use,will try more later"
2.0,Cheap material.. Broke almost instantly
2.0,"Looked like a good quality cable, but gave out within a month.  Don't think the connectors are touching properly to charge the phone.  Ordered 2 and both are having the same problem on 2 different phones.  Other cables around the house are charging both phones fine.<br /><br />Just my experience, maybe I happen to receive 2 defective units."
2.0,"This headset may be cheap, but it's that way for a reason. Do not recommend this to anyone"
2.0,"I originally purchased this as a backup memory for my android tablet. got it today seems fine put it inside the ad slot worked fine only to find out that kitkat won't allow files to be transferred onto the sd card. Now that's on me for not checking if it was comparable in the first place.<br /><br />Now what bothered me the most was the adapter I did not intend to use it because it was suppose to stay inside my android tablet. After setting it aside I began to use it, tested it out and says copy protected...looked online about it and the trouble seem to be with the lock and unlock slide on the adapter.<br /><br />Ok so I got that fixed, inserted the adapter with the mini sd on my laptops card reader on both lock and unlock, both said its write protected.So I did a bit of searching and others seem to have the same problem but later found out that the problem was the mini as adapter...the lock  and unlock button was so damn loose that when it is inserted it slide down back to lock, rendering it completely useless. First day of recieving it and it did not make a good first impression. I was planning on buying their 64-128gb versions but this is enough to convince me to buy from a different brand. My solution to this was to put something in the way to prevent the slider on the adapter from ever going down for it to be of any use whatsoever. I mean what kind of adapter is so lose to the point where inserting it (or even blowing on it heavily) will move the slider midway where it becomes useless to transfer any files to and from?<br /><br />Giving this product a very generous 2 star at best"
2.0,Did not work with my MAC as advertised.  I tried working the problem out with the seller with no results.  I returned it to Amazon.
2.0,Ok
2.0,"Purchased with a wireless security camera, but would not work in the camera as advertised. Put to use elsewhere but not good for the application it was bought for"
2.0,"A lot of research was done prior to purchasing this laptop. Seemed like a good deal for basic computer. Since my daughter has been using for 3 months - basic usage - watching netflix, browsing net, writing papers, there has been a consistent issue with slow speed AND touchpad and keyboard intermittently stop working. Sometimes at the same time! We are now having to purchase another one and will have to return this to Dell."
2.0,I have used android and apple the difference is huge
2.0,I have had 2 of these...both work for a few months
2.0,"You get what you pay for, just a little over a year old and the monitor constantly craps out on me.  Have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to turn on(multiple times daily).  Pain in the butt."
2.0,"I would give this product a 5 star, except the part that plugs into the computer ended up SNAPPING off, so I had to buy another one."
2.0,"I got this for my Raspberry PI<br />Berryboot did not work well with it, some times I would see the display most time not at all.<br />NOOBS worked great.<br />I have a Netgear Neo TV and the monitor gave me input out of range. change settings to 1600x900-60HZ<br />As I can't see anything I do not have a clue how to do that.<br />The 2 things I don't like is the audio jack cable is about 3/4 of an inch and is in the way for any thing next to that,<br />a 90 degree adapter will fix that but that adds more cost.<br />My VGA cable come unplugged now and then as there are not stand-offs to screw into.<br />All in all not great,  a button on it to change the output to a smaller resolution would be useful."
2.0,"I bought this item,. When i open the box and try to charge it.. It didn't work and it says  it's uncharged... So the plug is not working and i need new one, can you tell me what should i do!!"
2.0,Not the best
2.0,I don't know but I guess I have bad lucky with theses chargers but it won't charger unless it I would sit it in a certain position such a pain in the ass.
2.0,"I ordered this and tried to set it up with my CenturyLink VDSL connection. I was unsuccessful so I called CenturyLink. They asked if I had set VPI to 0 and VCI to 32. The Trendnet AC750 only showed VPI/VCI as N/A. So I called Trendnet and they told me there was no way to set VPI and VCI on the their modems. They advised me to return it which I did. I give it 2 stars since the customer service as very helpful and the set up menu was easy to use, but it does not work with CenturyLink VDSL."
2.0,"Broke after two months, the cable is actually fine. But the adapter for Lightning broke in two months.<br />Otherwise it works as advertised."
2.0,This SSD was dead after about month and half.  Edit: Crucial did replace the drive.
2.0,"I purchased this case for my iPad 4 and it fits great! I feel confident that my iPad is protected. Since it is a smart case, when you open and close the cover, the iPad will turn on and off. The problem is that when it is closed, it has a little wiggle room, the cover doesn't close very strongly, so anytime you bump the cover, it turns on and off, though you can't see it because it is closed. It is constantly killing my battery. I have to charge my battery completely every day now as opposed to every few days. Also, the case doesn't breath well and the back of the iPad gets quite hot. I wouldn't recommend this case to future buyers."
2.0,"I bought this for my son instead of the mini iPad. I have to say it's difficult to use. Storage is always full, locks up continuously and so many dang ads. Just to delete an app is ridiculous. I really had high hopes for this. Only good for reading books, Hulu and Netflix."
2.0,"This AC Adapter for MAC works erratically once you have it installed. It ships with out of date drivers (on the CD)  that will not function in Yosemite, so you must go to the EDIMAX web site and download newer drivers.  The Amazon price was 1/2 the norm, probably because it is old inventor.  Mine worked for awhile but is very flacky and aggravating to use.   It is borderline junk."
2.0,Doesn't run as fast as expected or advertised even with a direct hard connection
2.0,"THIS BOARD CAN NOT OPERATE MOST OF IT'S COMPONANTS AT THE SAME TIME!  BUYER BE WARE.  I've had slow, sometimes rude, tech support.  Almost always get generic level 1 support on strange off-hours and no call back.  Thunderbolt is not working.  Had to RMA first board, but turns out problems might be overall design flaws.  RAM identification off all DIMMS needs to be reset EVERYTIME you make a change to the board.  This is the 18th workstation I've built for film editing, and this kind of product is what drives people to apple.  I'm weeks behind because of this board, uninstalling and reinstalling software....  AVOID for professional work."
2.0,Misleading. This states that it is a &#34;graphics card&#34;.  A more accurate description would be a &#34;DVI add-on card&#34;.  There is no GPU this is designed to work with whatever GPU you have and add a DVI port.  If you GPU does not support an additional display this will not function as one.
2.0,"I was hoping for a basic laptop that I could doing some writing on and browse the internet with.<br /><br />I didn't expect it to run like it was 1994 dial up.<br /><br />It's horribly slow.  Sometimes just writing something in the Google search engine can take over 30 seconds.  That is unreasonable even for a cheap laptop that has no music, just a few documents, and barely any photos on it."
2.0,Did not fit the DVD player sdvd1332 as advertised
2.0,"Overall I expected more from this product, I thought I could use it to be more productive but so far all I'm able to do is play games because in my opinion this product isn't very work friendly."
2.0,I bought this case for my mom for her I pad air 2 and I don't fit correctly the you can turn the valume up or down
2.0,"The product seems to be working, however, after providing more barcodes than they requested, since they were not clear which ones they wanted, my refund application was denied.  If they are going to play games with the rebate, then why offer it at all?  I'm returning the product and taking my business elsewhere."
2.0,"I have had to shut power off and restart numerous times (it freezes up).  Subsequently I dropped it and cracked the screen (totally my fault).  It still works, but still freezes up."
2.0,"This drive is covered by plastic and made of an SMI SM3261AAS and Micron RAMs. It couldn't reach the claimed speed, neither read nor write. The earlier products of this model are made of Innostor is903 and intel RAMs, those drives are very good at speed. Now the drive downgrades. If you are seeking a USB3.0 flash drive that can read and write over 100MB/s, don't buy this one."
2.0,too slow
2.0,The actual case isn't as pictured. It's much more &#34;plastic&#34; in reality. Looks and feels cheap. Very disappointed for this price range.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:9825228de150770927a29236d46c36bf]] I just received the monitor today. Was very excited to get it setup only to be disappointed. I know things happen and they are sending me a replacement. Hopefully it works, other than the distortion it was easy to setup and easy to use. Has 1 HDMI, 1 VGA and 1 headphone hookup."
2.0,"It gets two stars for quality.<br /><br />This is the third razer headset I have owned that went bad before the two year mark. The first razer headset I owned had the microphone die on me. Second one broke apart. This one developed a short and eventually stopped working altogether.<br /><br />Apart from that, the first thing I noticed about it is how horribly uncomfortable it was. The cups are too small for my ears or virtually any adult's ears. But it's something I got used to and wasn't a big deal after a short while. There was a bigger problem, as I know there are reviews her also stating, that there are no physical controls. If you want to mute the microphone, you have to go through the razer software. That would be fine, since I rarely have a need to mute my microphone, except that occasionally it would mute itself for no particular reason, forcing me to open up the software, locate the headset in it (I always tried to move the headset to the first position, but for some reason my mouse would always reclaim the first position and I'd have to click the Kraken tab), then find the microphone settings and unmute it. If you do buy this headset, be sure to keep an eye on the microphone to make sure it's actually glowing before you start trying to talk to anyone.<br /><br />I am absolutely sick of Razer. Their mice are fantastic, but their headsets are trash before the two year mark, no matter how well you take care of them."
2.0,"Bad response time when gaming, sending it back"
2.0,I like how it works but 6 weeks after I bought it a piece broke off and now the magnet pulls out anytime I need to separate it from the iPad. It's past the 30 day return and I can't find a way to contact them to have it repaired or replaced. I would say not worth the cost. It should last more than 6 weeks.
2.0,"I'm pretty pissed off right now. I paid $50 for this case 3 months ago for my brand new 13&#34; MacBook Pro. When I carry it outside the home, I always put it in a padded sleeve (hence, the case is mostlu for aesthetics and protection from minor drops and scratches. About 2 weeks after I got it, some cracks appeared in one of the corners. Then today, the plastic in the opposite corner completely broke off, leaving that corner of the computer unprotected. There is a 1-year warranty on the case, so I will be contacting Speck to hopefully get a new case or a refund. The worse part is that Amazon doesn't seem to carry the Poppy Red color anymore, so if Speck can't get me an exact replacement, I'll probably have to go with a different color… Or maybe a different brand.<br /><br />I will also add that I've used Speck cases on 4 different MacBook Pros since 2009 and I've never had a case break this fast."
2.0,"Case is Very nice, however said it would fit my 15.6 Dell inspirion 3000 series & it does not."
2.0,Product came with a broken corner. I kept it because it does not affect it too much and I really needed a case for my computer and did not have the time or an alternative.
2.0,"First one I received the power cord kept falling out of the unit.  The second one works fine, but there are very few apps that will run on it.  I was told this is because of the limited RAM internally.  I downloaded off-line maps and books, can use it for basic internet and email at wifi spots, but most  apps (utility and game) that show in the AppStore state they are incompatible.  I wanted something to be able to see road maps and driving information instead of on a phone screen, but this does not even run GasBuddy.  If you want something very simple and basic, it is fine."
2.0,"Its not 100% improvement.  Anytime a product has instructions which says search youtube for install method that is a problem.<br />Could not get 100% of bubbles out.  While using credit card to get more force to remove bubbles, the actual screen is scratched.  It was my mistake to buy a laptop with a mirror like screen and my mistake buying this to try to remedy it."
2.0,"Crappy plastic sound.  If you want good sound at all, I'd say this is not for you.  I'd rather not listen to music than hear this weak, poorly balanced sound.  Sending them back."
2.0,For the price this product  did not last. It quit working not long after  we bought  it.
2.0,Arrived with a teal stain
2.0,"This tablet is very slow, a waste of money."
2.0,It didn't fit.
2.0,worked great for a bit then it just crapped out on me and now it will not read any devices plugged into it. and some time my computer does even recognize the hub itself.
2.0,Too large for my macbook retina 15
2.0,"Worked great, for about 3 months then it just died, no power to the unit at all. It's unfortunate because besides the build quality I can't fault the device on it's performance."
2.0,The card works until your computer goes into sleep mode or you restart your computer.  Each time the drivers are lost and the computer thinks its a new card in your PCI slot.<br /><br />I tried everything to make it remember the drivers and card.  This card seems to not work well with Windows 10 and I don't see any updates for it for windows 10.<br /><br />Goin
2.0,"Horrible, the laptop is damaged beyond repair, I didn´t drop it or got it wet, it just stopped displaying image..."
2.0,My projector didn't fit the case eventhough it states it does.
2.0,"The height of the cable end seems too high, because when trying it with my Macbook Pro's ethernet port, it doesn't fit in all the way and snap into place. While it works, if I move my laptop it will come undone and I lose my ethernet connection. I tried it in my router as well, and it won't fit all the way like and click like my other ethernet cables. It doesn't seem to be a manufacturing defect, since I've bought several of this exact cable. Seems like a huge oversight and large inconvenience. That said, the price and quality of the connection is good."
2.0,Didn't fit . Plastic : material was too thin
2.0,Looking at the picture you would think this is a 2 part case with both front and back covers but you only get the back cover. The picture shows 2 back covers so there is no cover to protect the screen. I thought I was getting something like the cell phone holsters but not so.
2.0,Came with a fried ram slot. Apperentlly it's a common thing. DO NOT BUY
2.0,Only the USB3.0 ports continue to work for me.  All front-facing USB2.0 ports no longer work.
2.0,"Just got mine in and will be returning. It's a good product, but I was under the impression it was one with a backing. Mine might also be defective. The backlit keyboard doesn't light up."
2.0,"Before I bought this mouse I have two mouse that I like to use, the G502 proteus and the Razer Naga. Lately I been trying to find a mouse that excels at both as a FPS mouse and a MMO mouse. A friend bought this mouse and recommend it to me so I thought I try it. My expectations weren't high because this is my first mouse from ROCCAT.<br /><br />All I can say is that this mouse is SUPERB. The side buttons doesn't feel cheap at all and there's soo many ways you can customize the side buttons and you can practically use this mouse for ANY game that you want to play(FPS,MMO,MOBA,etc...).<br /><br />For now this is THE mouse for me but I have to wait and see if there's any problems with this mouse in the coming months. I will try my best to update this review.<br /><br />only downside to this mouse is the cost. 130 dollars is rather steep for a mouse, but if you have the money to spend I highly recommend this mouse.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT:10/11/2015-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Ok something wrong with the Nyth software. Everytime I tried to open it in Windows 10 it keeps crashing and I can't set up any of my buttons. It doesn't even recognize my mouse half of the time. What makes matters worse is that when I opened the task manager I found out that it's a CPU hog. Take a look at my image that I attached. Took up nearly 30% of my CPU and it made my CPU alot hotter since it usually idles at around 32 degrees Celcius. FIX YOUR SOFTWARE ROCCAT. For a 100+ mouse a s***ty software is simply unacceptable."
2.0,Did not perform as advertised.  Threw it away.
2.0,Wasn't a fan of this case! Replaced it right away. Looked too cheap.
2.0,"I bought this in January 2015. It worked pretty well for me and I was pleased with it (with occasional problems with key repeats, and a connection delay of about 3 seconds every time you start to use it, but whatever). As of 2 weeks ago, 2 areas of the keyboard no longer work (ZXCVNM,./ and the Enter and backslash key). There was no dropping or spilling on the keyboard event. I carry it with me, but nothing out of the ordinary happened. Seems like it should last more than 7 months."
2.0,The keyboard was broken when I got it. The left touch pad was missing the rivet that keeps it from flapping.
2.0,The power cord was to short.
2.0,The television screen flickers lines on the screen when the elgato is hooked up the the tv.
2.0,"My Fire always said, &#34; Low power charger.&#34; After about a month and a half, I had to put it in a certain position to make the connection. Nope."
2.0,"Despite the manufacturer's claims to the contrary, only on of these cables works well (one of these cables brings up the annoying statement that the device is not supported, and the other needs to be plugged in 4-5 times in order to work)."
2.0,"Too bad.  Great screen, keyboard and design.  But the touchpad has a terrible delay when you use two finger swipe to move down a page.  To make matters worse Dell's responses range from its Microsoft's Driver's, to the notion that this is normal operation for this model.  Emails to support promise a 24 hour response but in my case took 7 days.  Returned.  Again, a shame."
2.0,"Compatibility problems with Mac Mini 2094.  I purchased it with external power supply.  Mac mini would go to sleep and shut down.  Removed external power supply and it worked normality.  Apparently this is a common problem with USB 3.0 hubs and Macs.  Mac mini now starts automatically when I plug it in when using this hub even when it is unpowered.  I may have to give up on it.<br /><br />Other than that... Looks good, and moves a lot of data."
2.0,Sadly Died after 7 months of use.<br />It did a great job when it was functional.<br />Time to try out the 1 year warranty.
2.0,"The adhesive strip keeps falling off after only 2 days. I followed instructions to the letter, and even cleaned them according to insert."
2.0,The audio on this set works great but the mic quality is beyond sub par.
2.0,"Not so easy to install, use all 3 protectors and still ended up with some dust bubble that I wast able to take out. It could be me, or the protectors, but I bought some for my IPad 2, from another seller and I  got it right the 1st time and they included great instructions."
2.0,Can't get a driver to work with windows 8.1. I didn't get any paper work with it.
2.0,"Mamma always said, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.  Such is the case when I saw this and thought it was a great deal.  Found them difficult to put on without bubbles.  This wasn't for lack of experience as I've done this with iPhones and tablets before with great success however the products I used were better, and of course, a little more expensive."
2.0,Hard to use. Still not able to connect. Not for the beginner. UGH
2.0,I have had this mac book case for no more than three days and the bottom part has already broken.  It looks great but it's not durable at all.
2.0,looks nice but shuts its self off randomly. Not as great quality as i would like but for a cheap touch screen lap top you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Got a bad one.  Amazon is great with returns so I'm not worried about that.  When I installed the drive it spun up and sounded like an optical drive, vibrating and all.  Could never be recognized in disk manager so I couldn't even format it.  I'll try again.  Had good luck with Hitachi drives before and hard to beat the $39.95 Woot price.  Also, packing consisted of an antistat bag and an air pillow in a box large enough so it could slam around so that couldn't have helped any.  So this review is more of Woot and their packaging than of Hitachi."
2.0,If you have a square tablet that just fits beware that the corners of the case are sounded.Ii could not zip it shut.  Will have to size up.
2.0,Its time for Pyle to step up its game and stop making products like the inferior from over sea. Not good quality
2.0,"its ok, does the job, but, its optics are touchy, one moment it will work the next it doesnt want to move the arrow, it has a cheap powersave mode that turns it off when its in motion meaning this mouse can NOT be used for gaming. it also seems to be an off brand of another mouse designs just like it with a different bug logo instead of a spider. its like the laser/eagle model cars like 7 companies made them all with their own logos lol. if you in an office this would work for you."
2.0,"These are overly sensitive and cause a tremendous amount of handling as they turn single clicks into double clicks and open documents or send e-mails you were only considering to take the next step on. I've tried adjusting the double click setting, but still not finding the proper balance. If I can't these may be returned as the number of inadvertent click throughs are causing me a tremendous amount of difficulties."
2.0,Drive quit working after being used for a month.
2.0,"Fantastic Product, Good Quality, very satisfied with this purchase!"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:918ddd6f6d6f2c098f1a9120dc5f0d69]]I was impressed with the Innogie® 10400mAh AlienPower Portable Charger due to the futuristic styling and battery efficiency. Does the Innogie 6000mah Passion Dual charger has the same qualities? See below to get the answer.<br /><br />Construction- The battery pack is made of brushed aluminium and it looks great. I like the fact that manufacturers are now moving to aluminium (like apple) and it is 100 times better than the cheap plastic looking devices we used to get. But even though the finish is good, the build is not perfect. the battery i got had rough edges and there were some gaps in construction. But still i will give the construction a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Battery Backup- Now we are all buying this battery for the battery backup it provides. 6000mah means it should charge a iphone 6 plus at least 1.5 - 2 times. But in real world testing, the battery died after charging my iphone 6 plus from 0% to 66%. I was expecting at-least one full charge for my phone. So from a battery backup perspective i will give this product a 1 out of 5, as it doesnt deliver 6000mah. (maybe my product was defective, but while going through all the reviews in amazon i found that no-one is getting the rated 6000mah battery backup)<br /><br />And my biggest gripe other than the lack of adequate battery backup is the way Innogie tried to use a single battery to display the amount of charge left. I am still trying to figure out how this is supposed to work. The manual says it will have 3 led's but i see only one. So maybe my battery is defective. Because of this i will give the battery a 2 out of 5 rating<br /><br />Video Review on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndRTq2nvEBw"
2.0,"Unfortunately this USB device doesn't fit in any of the USB ports on my Surface Pro 3 or its docking station. The width of the red border around the key is just a fraction too wide to fit in the ports. When it does fit in a USB port such as on my desktop, it works fine. The key loop seems a little thin and fragile, I would not feel comfortable trusting it to stay secure."
2.0,"So first of all, the speeds are absolutely amazing on this card on the 5Ghz band. According to speed tests, it's almost exactly like a strait Ethernet connection and I could not tell the difference; 125 mbps. 2.4GHz however I only get about half that from my AC router (Linksys WRT1900AC).<br /><br />The biggest problem I have is just how bad the actual signal quality is on 5Ghz. I'm getting about -75 dbm which is almost unusable for me as a gamer. I don't know if this can be fixed with new driver updates, but for now I'm just going to have to use the 2.4 band and sacrifice speed.<br /><br />If you don't plan on playing video games and the extent of your online activities just include basic emails, videos, streams, music, ect, then you will do alright with this card. But you're better off just getting another card that's probably a lot cheaper."
2.0,Quit working after 2 weeks
2.0,"I purchased this item a while back, and it would never charge my laptop. It would keep my laptop on, but again never charged. I have a dell Inspiron 17."
2.0,The tip of the charging thing broke off within a week and I had to throw it away because it was useless.
2.0,Very finicky to get it to play.
2.0,"The arm is way to stiff, it takes both hands to adjust it."
2.0,"Didn't work, but I was using old cables and they might have been the problem. I bought a new much longer cable and resolved my issue."
2.0,These look in the picture a lot bigger than they are - they even appear as if they are over the ear ..<br /><br />The are on-ear .. and small .. I'd say they'd be great for a teen - but for the average adult head - they will squeeze your brains out.
2.0,Product is alright but it does not support 1920x1080 u have to directly connect it to the monitor save the settings then switch it back to the switcher and it is very flimsy
2.0,I have three kids and was looking for a new case for their iPad. I have another case that we've been very happy with (the iGuy) so I had something to compare to. This case was VERY hard to get on. The material felt more flimsy than I expected. I'm sure it's a decent shock absorber but I didn't even give my kids a chance to use this one because I don't trust the stand either. My rating is probably lower than it would be if I didn't have another case designed for kids that was significantly better. I would check out the iGuy before this one.
2.0,"Please be aware that Synology categorically does NOT repair these units out of warranty.  And it also does NOT provide/sell any major components (like motherboard) to any third-party including the customer, or any repair center.  So once it breaks, that's it you will not be able to repair at any cost (besides spending another $600 for the new system of course).  You can search for tons of problems people have had with their systems because of motherboard issues.  Once something like this happens you'll have to deal with less than stellar and incompetent technical support , where you will be the main troubleshooter of the system and it will take days for them to respond.  Synology might replace your entire system with refurbished one if it is in warranty, but if it is not, then you will have to shell out for another system.  Considering that their system is priced like a premium product ( the premium product prices reflect the fact that the system is upgradeable and repairable in the future), one would expect this as a given, but alas this is not the case.  Synology is currently being investigated by the California Attorney General office for their fraudulent practices.  Synology is not clearly labeling their products as not repairable after warranty expires, and also for violating (at least) California Consumer protections laws which oblige the manufacturer to provide repair and parts for a certain number of years depending on the product price, regardless of warranty applicability.  Currently, Synology is trying to claim that it is not a home appliance but purely a business-related product and that the California Consumer protections act does not apply to them."
2.0,"Lately everything freezes up and we have to unplug it from the computer and power, wait a few minutes and then reconnected to get anything to recognized. Including our wireless keyboard and mouse.<br />Doesn't work with our Nexus 6 for syncing. I know it says it wont charge tablets and this is a big phone. But syncing to get full resolution photos off is a must!"
2.0,fell apart rather quickly
2.0,No longer compatible with Comcast. Had to send it back.
2.0,"If you're just looking for something to get your wrist off of the desk to avoid that semi-painful hot spot that builds up on that outside wrist-bone, this will be just fine. But it will be *just* fine. The top coating is nice enough -- somewhat tacky rather than soft. The bottom doesn't sufficiently grip the desk, so you get some slide. I use a trackpad and get some slide, so I can only imagine it to be worse with a mouse you actually move around. The cushioning is really just a dense foam. It doesn't compress much like gel or whatever would, which is fine. It does its job, but does it unremarkably."
2.0,"It was an ok tablet, but it would freeze every time we would try and switch apps. Going from YouTube to a game. Nothing else would be runny. Didn't end up keeping it"
2.0,"For my purposes this usb hub failed. So be cautious if you work on a Macbook Pro and need to expand your USB ports. I had several issues with harddrives randomly unmounting. Many times this would occur during data transfers. After the issues I research extensively on the issue and it's been widely discussed. The performance of this device worked in other areas flawlessly, however for my purposes it simply just did not work. So don't fully count this guy out, especially if you're on PC. If you're on Mac, be cautious but you can always return it if you run into the same problem as I."
2.0,Too difficult to maneuver.
2.0,"Feels very cheap and the graphics are poor, which I should have known by the price.  I ended up ordering a Samsung galaxy and giving this to my 2 yr old neice."
2.0,"Aside from the fact that it's sluggish at best, it doesn't have adequate cooling. That makes processor-intensive things a no-go. That includes, for example, the upgrade to Windows 10. You can do much better."
2.0,"failed after 7 months.<br />time, effort, & cost of RMA almost not worth it"
2.0,"Product worked for less than 15 months, which was disappointing. I can no longer transfer files to the card (despite numerous troubleshooting attempts). I will likely go with a non-Sony product for my next micro SD card."
2.0,"Tablet had issues from the second I powered it on. Only some of the letters on the keyboard work. So unless you don't need to use the H,N,U or C go ahead and buy it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"I received four Kindles. All had some variation of dust under the screen, pin hole dots that light up, or uneven lighting. It's seriously disappointing considering the Kindle Paperwhite 3 is an absolutely amazing product, but the quality control during manufacturing ruins the product."
2.0,"Half of the screwdriver toolbits were broken on arrival, the metal toolsbits fell out of their handles...so all of that is useless.  The rest of the tools don't stay in place, and its pretty untidy, if you move the case around at all everything will move around the case, so open it carefully."
2.0,This remote worked for like 1 month then it messed up and keeps disconnecting the p3 remotes for around $9.99 are better
2.0,I have had this bag for nearly 1 year. Great bag for the price. I &#34;like&#34; it. It holds my laptop and book and looks good.<br />The reason I gave it 2  stars because for 3 reasons<br />1) There is no grip - i think this is a design flaw - i miss that - especially when i am rushing<br />2) the magnet clip to close the bag never holds properly - wrong design here again<br />3) the leather strap - really bad quality - it gives on falling apart. - that is the worse.<br /><br />Anyway I am on the lookout for a new leather bag.
2.0,I was very impressed with the device until within 4 months of purchasing the product the battery expanded several times its size and popped off the cover.
2.0,"When it works, the speed is fine, but what's really frustrating is that every few minutes the USB connection fails, saying the device malfunctioned and Windows did not recognize it, and it either returns after a few seconds, or I have to unplug it and put it back in."
2.0,"Needed a new drive and saw this one at a fair price but not even 3 months did this drive survive, you have warranty and what not but I mean, I needed this to work not fail.<br /><br />Packaging was fair for a bare hard drive."
2.0,Not happy at all.  The magnetic closure doesnt work and there is no auto sleep  Im going to return it
2.0,"Takes way too much pressure to depress buttons.  Much more than any other mouse, so it takes some getting used to.  I'm clicking a mouse, not launching a rocket."
2.0,"works, but I have a fat head...feels like my head is in a vice after a few minutes...not comfy"
2.0,"Lagging on windows is there, as well on mac it even doesn't connect. I installed logictec control center on mac which always shows that unable to find any device. No idea what to do."
2.0,It's bigger than 13 in
2.0,Micro USB connector broke within 3 months.
2.0,Sounds is muffledeven after hours of tweeking
2.0,"When I ordered this I had high hopes but was very disappointed. When I opened my package it claimed it had a USB to USB cable in the box which was not to be found, the instructions weren't helpful, and  I don't understand why an advertised HD monitor does not come with an HDMI cable in the box.<br />I would recommend buying another monitor."
2.0,Does not last long
2.0,"I bought this so my granddaughter could watch movies and play games while on the airplane.  When I received it I didn't have any complaints, it seemed to work just fine.  I tend to be a bit clumsy with my electronics (ie, Samsung Galaxy 5 and Kindle-I have had the Kindle for several years) and have dropped them numerous times, I even dropped my Kindle in water a couple of times, but both still work perfectly with no issues.  No, I don't have any special kind of covers on either to protect them, just normal every day sleeves.  I accidentally dropped the Dragon, while putting the screen protector on it, and the screen shattered, I was devastated.  I tried to call the company several times, during business hours, and was sent directly to voice mail each time and all I wanted was another screen so I could fix it.  I found a screen on Ebay and received it today, so I put it on myself.  The screen comes up and I can get onto the tablet, but it is not working the way it was when I first received it, you can't get into some apps and others you have to hold the screen a certain way.  Also, when you touch on certain parts of the screen it won't do anything.  I know that the company should have been the one to put the new screen on, but when you aren't able to talk to a live person then you take matters into your own hands.  I am very disappointed of the customer service they provide and now I don't have a tablet for my granddaughter to use on our trip unless I spend more money to buy another one, which if I do that, I would have been better off buying a name brand tablet for that kind of money.  I won't buy another Dragon unless they can improve their customer service."
2.0,"This case bugs me and I prefer the one on my older kindle more, by another maker.  It was about 1/2 the price."
2.0,"Awesome present from my boyfriend, worked great for a few months and now the light is faint and the mouse is unresponsive."
2.0,"Charges fine, however the plug is too long for the input and doesn't sit flush to the side of the tablet.<br /><br />You can see in the picture that the adaptor is charging, but sticks out ~3 mm."
2.0,"I bought this router through Best Buy to replace the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 that I fried.  I have a lot of devices that connect, both through wired and WiFi connections, to the internet.  This seemed like it had everything I needed.  I used it for a few weeks and ended up returning it to get the newest Netgear Nighthawk X6. The biggest reason was that this router literally cut my internet speeds in half.  I have a 100 Mbps connection,and when I plug directly into my modem, I was getting that.  I plug in through this router (only connected device, wired connection).  I was getting 50 Mbps.  My old Nighthawk had no loss in speed.  Was not happy.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great mobile app for remote management<br />- Easy to setup using the browser<br />- Smaller physical footprint<br />- Great network management page on router<br /><br />Cons (besides what I mentioned)<br />- Limited functionality when it came to customizing the network<br />- Could not log in via Safari.<br />- Had trouble with DNS on wired devices.  Had to manually set in the router.<br />- Used Flash for parts of router management (I hate Flash)<br />- made me setup an account with Cisco in order to log in to the router for the initial setup.<br /><br />This is marketed (and priced) for high-end users, but performs at a mid-range level."
2.0,Very nice but the camera hole does not match up. You have to take it out of the case to take a picture.
2.0,"Worked fine for a month. Louder than the one I was replacing. Mostly functional, however occasionally cant recover from sleep mode properly."
2.0,I thought this cover had a screen protector too when it is labeled as a full body protector. It does not.
2.0,"very flimsy, wouldnt recommend it"
2.0,"With regards to speed and ease of use, I'd give this 5 stars. I have my FiOS ethernet modem in the basement and the WiFi connection from there to the main floor gives at best 5Mbps-down/1Mbps-up.<br /><br />But, after plugging in 1 of these devices in the basement and hooking up to a LAN port on my router, and plugging the other device on the main floor and an ethernet-thunderbolt bridge connection immediately improves my speeds to 50Mbps-down/5Mbps-up.<br /><br />Soooo, the reason I'm giving 2 stars is because, despite offering the pass-through outlet that's supposed to ensure that you're not losing an outlet, what is not explained is that the top of the device is so large and extends upward in such a way that if placed in the bottom receptacle of a 2-receptacle outlet, it blocks the Grounding socket of the top receptacle.<br /><br />So, in fact, you do lose 1 receptacle with this device, pass-through or not."
2.0,"Works, except it doesn't provide power to connected devices as is expected from 1394."
2.0,"I tried to install this on my T420, but it was too wide. It actually overlaps the sides creating a ridge when trying to mouse over the edges. Seems to stick okay, but it's no use if it doesn't fit properly!"
2.0,"Bought this mouse in the hopes it would work OK, it didn't the software would take 20 seconds of more to save changes as well it didn't work well at all on the lighting etc. The mouse slips in hand so if you need to pick it up to reposition on you mouse pad during gameplay good luck! The sides of the mouse barley have any texture and it doesn't have a rubberized finish. The top buttons are a good feature but my 3 finger sat on the top right button as the mouse seemed to &#34;bend&#34; to the left as the space for your finger was just a little small. All this did make for a good experience. PS I have medium sized hands! I have returned the mouse today and it will ship back to Amazon Monday 08/31/15"
2.0,I didn't realize this was frosted and it has a noticeable &#34;K&#34; logo on the bottom right of the case that is unattractive.
2.0,"I'm not sure if it's a refurbished iPad, the package is a little bit yellow, but the iPad is ok until now."
2.0,Worked fine for a few months and now just stopped working.  tried to get a replacement with no results.  I would not recommend to buy this product.
2.0,Not a good product.  I replaced it with one that has the backlit feature.
2.0,Not a good product. Purchased it because of the look and usb dongle less feature but it is a troublesome device. Doesn't work with windows 7 at all! Connected to Macbook air (yosemite) but I have to search and connect it every time I reboot! Microsoft should provide appropriate drivers for this mouse to get it working with most devices. Even there is no help or support information for this product in the web. Better look for any other device with similar feature.
2.0,"It's just okay.  Design idea is good, but the brown outer cover keeps &#34;unbuckling&#34; from the black section.  Plus there was a funny smell when we originally received this.  It was such a good price we decided to keep it, instead of the hassle of returning it.  It's just that we use it without the outside cover."
2.0,"This broke after minimal use, after 6 months."
2.0,The customer service is bad..it costs you to talk to someone for help even though the hardware warranty is still good.  Not a good product...my recommendation go with a another company that has a full warranty.  Very costly mistake.
2.0,Having a hard time understanding the operating system. I find myself not using the computer.
2.0,"The SDHC card standard is valid up to a max capacity of 32GB. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data If you buy this card.<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as &#34;SDHC&#34; (not &#34;SDXC&#34;). The SD card association controls and licenses the SD card standards and they define &#34;SDHC&#34; up to a maximum capacity of 32GB. For larger capacity cards, only the &#34;SDXC&#34; standard is valid.<br /><br />Good 64GB SD cards are out there, but they will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.  Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information."
2.0,"Very disappointed with the transfer rates. I was expecting over 100mbps since so many other people have reported this, but at best I get 60mbps read and 30mbps write. It goes as slow as 15mbps read. (Yes, this is on USB 3)<br />I have tested this on several reliable computers that I know work faster with other USB drives. I have tested with several programs and types of files.<br />I would suggest avoiding this device for the transfer speeds alone. I believe they use a different controller in the newer models, so if you receive a new model it will be different quality than the older ones. The white model is of course newer than the grey.<br /><br />Read and write speeds aside, it's not that great of a USB stick in terms of physical build.<br />It looks okay and is a sturdy build, but the part that moves is made from a softer translucent plastic that stretches extremely easily. Before I even opened the packet I could see a few distinctive scratch marks on this part of the plastic. It has scratches on both sides that are easy to notice. This gives the device a cheap feel to it.<br />Second complaint is the function of the sliding protector. As others have said it's a little hard to close it, some force is needed to lock it into the closed position. When it's in the unlocked position the protective cap doesn't lock into place, it slides around loosely so if you grab 2/3 of the stick you're grabbing an unstable sliding surface.<br />These are only minor problems that can be ignored, but worth mentioning anyway as I can see people preferring a more quality build USB stick especially if they're getting a high capacity one to keep for a long period."
2.0,This broke on my second day of using it.  I also purchased one for my IPad mini from a different company that has lasted 8 months now with practical daily use so I do not think it was something I did.
2.0,"I bought this because the wifi card on my Macbook Pro overheated and rather than spending the time to open up my Macbook and replace it, I opted for a cheap replacement that should have been a quick and easy fix.  What could go wrong?  Lots, apparently.<br /><br />As the reviews mention this ships with a mini CD for the drivers (which few if any Macbooks can even run).  Not a problem because there was a link to Mediatech drivers that I could use.  However these drivers are terrible.  Even when you are not connected they display three bars for wireless signal strength and connectivity.  I am sporadically disconnected from the internet (not totally unusual) but when I try to reconnect by clicking on the wifi signal bars (which are still at 3 full bars) I get 2 options sometimes (turn on/of wifi and open wireless utility) and then sometimes just one option (open wireless utility).  When I click on open wireless utility, typically nothing happens.  Sometimes there's a screen flicker but generally nothing.  So I try all the usual things, force quit and reopen the program (it reopens but still won't work), put the computer to sleep (no help), pull the USB out and put plug it in again (nada), and finally the tried and true reboot the computer (success!).<br /><br />I came back to Amazon to look for solutions and found more up to date drivers which (after digging around on the website for a while to find, then installing, and reinstalling twice) did absolutely nothing to alleviate this problem.<br /><br />So after a week of fiddling with this thing I am here to tell you not to bother.  Maybe it's great for PCs (though I would suggest others after my experience with this one) but it's definitely failed me as far as Macbooks go.<br /><br />I get it's only 10 bucks for this thing, but devices from phones to dishwashers now have fully functioning wifi so instead I'm just going to return this and buy a burrito as a reward for my troubles for the last week.  Seriously, it had onejob to do!!  Anyway, time for a burrito."
2.0,"just okay, cheep feeling plastic and the button is extremely hard to locate when writing, not an intuitive design. , ended up returning for another stylus with better rocker buttons"
2.0,Top won't snap on.
2.0,Expected much more. Super hard to understand what I'm writting because the words look soooo odd!
2.0,Casing around micro USB end is too thick to fit into my phone with case.
2.0,"Drive works OK. However, it is very cumbersome in terms of pushing the connector out of the blue sheath. Need to return it."
2.0,"This product lasted for about three months and then shot craps. The rubber is flimsy and eventually pulled free from the hard plastic. And no, I didn't pull the charger from the phone in a rough manner. The product is just cheaply made."
2.0,"I went through 3 of these cases and they all broke....very poorly designed.  The reason I kept replacing them with the same one is because my company has a warranty on it.  One broke 1 day later, the screws just couldn't hold up.  It's not like I use it a lot either.  After the 3 one, I did NOT want another one even if it's free.  Ended up ordering &#34;Logitech Type+ Protective Case with Integrated Keyboard for iPad Air&#34; and love it so much!  It's even cheaper than the ZAGG at only $49.99.  Don't waste your money on this item."
2.0,Bought this shortly after I got my MBP a while ago. Since I like to keep things new and fresh I get a new decal at least once a year. This will not come off as cleanly as I'd hoped.
2.0,Shipping charges too high for a cheap product!!!
2.0,"Not all 3.0 USB are created equal. Yeah, this one is slow but cheap.  If you're gonna label it USB 3.0, should back it up with comparable performance.  It's no better than 2.0.  If they labeled it 2.0, I would have given it 4 stars.  Docked 3 stars for deception.  Cheap price, decent build quality, crap performance.<br /><br />Kingston, you whiffed on this one."
2.0,"The first thing I'd like to point out, is that unlike the picture of this item, the cables I received do not have a rubber guard over the clip, so minus two stars for the false advertising. The next problem, is that the first one they shipped me was non-functional, so I had to return it (minus another star). The replacement cable actually worked, and does what it's supposed to, so no further complaints."
2.0,Didn't make it six months.
2.0,This Case began to fall apart after a couple of weeks of light use. The keyboard guides are bonded to the base.  The glue started to separate from the guides very quickly.
2.0,"Only works to import CDs to iTunes - and only certain CDs at that. The eject doesn't always work. Many times I have had to unplug the USB, and plug it back in so that the drive can restart. Then, after it configures, it will open. If you're looking for something temporary (until you get a new computer) this is okay. For long term use, I would not recommend this."
2.0,"I would never recommend these. They only work if you bend the cord until you find a spot where it starts charging then don't move it. It constantly goes in and out of charging and says, &#34;This accessory may not be supported.&#34; The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because it will charge if you find the right position of the cord."
2.0,"I bought this mostly because I was expecting an 8MP rear facing camera... come to find out its only 2MP!! The front facing is only .3, so I figured the rear would make up for it. Its pretty slow to run apps such as Snapchat, tumblr, etc. I was expecting what was advertised. I'm not pleased. Going to get the Kindle 7 instead..."
2.0,The size of the cover is too large. I makes it hard to use the touch screen in the corner (where the alerts are located). The overall thickness of the is about twice the thickness of my previous cover for my older tablet. I like to put it in my pocket and this thickness precludes that.
2.0,Great mouse though of the 3 I have 2 have broken by key G17 going out.
2.0,"It WILL NOT fit the Fitbit Charge.  You can get it halfway in and as long as it isn't budged or if a slight breeze doesn't blow by, it MAY charge it for a bit."
2.0,"It works, but is extremely annoying if you're used to an Apple mouse. The first day it arrived, I threw it in the &#34;computer crap&#34; drawer and ordered a new Apple mouse."
2.0,"I really liked this at first because  it was a replacement of my Gen 2 by same company and brand. I had mis-placed it temporarily. . I carried the Gen2 for a YEAR never lost the cap because it had a good friction fit. This Gen 3 model  from the first day I thought that it wasn't secure. The cap fell off after a week of use and can't find it. Luckily I found my gen 2 I had so I started carrying it instead until I find the lost cap  (if I ever do)  it will STILL have the same problem though.  Wacom offered to send me another cap after jumping through the hoops, which I thought was really thoughtful. Was not begging them for one but notified them that I thought it was definitely a design flaw.  UPDATE: Well I found the cap and less than 12 hours later lost it again so returned stylus for refund."
2.0,"I had to go back to the &#34;universal&#34; charger because my laptop told me immediately, this charger was insufficient. I bought this so it would charge the new battery correctly and not ruin it, but using it would ruin the battery much, much sooner."
2.0,One of the punchdown teeth was defective and i had to use pliers to ensure the green cable would be tight enough for a good contact.  It was not worth my time returning it and so I made it work.  Other than that it was the solution i was looking for.
2.0,"This monitor works fine for movies and games, but text on this monitor is not very crisp.  I would not recommend it if you do a lot of reading on your computer."
2.0,They're 40 dollar stickers. Thats all.
2.0,"I got this for my Mac (2014 MacBook Pro) so that I could get movies, photos, etc off my Mac and onto this NAS drive. Well, for us Mac users this is not easy. I just spent about an hour and half sharing my screen and chatting with someone at QNAP because I was VERY frustrated about getting this to work as I envisioned it. Turns out it really only works well with Windows machines. For instance-I have 5 photo libraries (in my Photos app) and the biggest one has over 26,000 photos. I would need to export all of them and then drag and drop them all into the QNAP app. Ok. Will the metadata stay in tack? Will it automatically update when I add new photos? Not sure to the first and no to the second. The gentleman I spoke with had no idea what a Mac's setup is-he had no clue as to Photos and it's setup. That was what I learned-QNAP is not Mac friendly or intended to be used by Macs. Bottom line. My QNAP is working for Time Machine backups-that is good thing. I can put documents on it and access them anywhere. That's a good thing. But that's about it. Still trying to decide if I should return it... I have time invested in it. And money spent. I did tell him that that is what I have found out, that the QNAP is not made for Mac users and there is a large group of us out there and QNAP would do well to add a Mac guru to their staff. Just wanted to share my lesson learned with you...."
2.0,"I ordered it but the main bag is different from the bag in the picture. I'm really disappointed. It still looks ok, but I was expecting a bag with a flap and 2 pockets. I didn't get any of that."
2.0,"Works well for streaming WatchESPN, but doesn't get Netflix,  which is pre-installed for goodness sake.  Also touch and go with HBO go.  The video is gorgeous but only when it works.  I talked to tech support to try and get help with which browser works best, as the Internet can be Laggy and get stuck. No help at all from them.  My Galaxy alpha phone gets much better and faster Internet service.  How can that be possible when this is supposed to be so much newer and have blazing speeds etc?"
2.0,I have had this modem for just less than a year. Recently found my speeds on Comcast were much lower than what I was paying for. Tried resetting modem and several other things none of which helped. I just replaced this modem with a Netgear CM500-100NAS modem and my download speeds nearly quadrupled.
2.0,"They way this is measured is not the cable length, but it is tip to tip. Unless you can connect something REALLY close, look for a 1ft cable or a different 6&#34; cable that does not include the length of the connectors."
2.0,"This is actually a very nice laptop with a major flaw: the trackpad.  It's practically unusable.  Trying to right-click in any manner is very difficult.  Two-finger tap to right click?  Nope, only works about 1/3 of the time.  Trying to right click at the bottom right of the trackpad?  Simple, right?  No...the bottom of the trackpad's click area is actually only one button, not two (as you'd want for left-click and right-click).  as a result your finger needs to be on the mousepad in the bottom-right zone while clicking in order for it to register a right-click instead of a left click.  Still simple, right?  No...the most comfortable place to click without actually looking at the trackpad is on the edge of the trackpad, but when you do this not enough of your finger is on the trackpad to register that you want to make a right click.  Also, most multi-finger gestures (such as scrolling) take 2-3 tries to get it to register, and require you to press down very hard to get them to work.  I know this is a long commentary about the trackpad but it's seriously incredibly difficult to use.  I feel like I'm fighting the trackpad whenever I'm using it.  It seriously wrecks what is otherwise (mostly) a great computer.  Also, I'm constantly hitting the trackpad while typing and it moves the cursor - there's options in the settings that are supposed to address this but none of them actually do the job.<br /><br />Pro's: keyboard is great, screen (i have the non-touch ips semi-gloss screen) is great.  I have the larger extended battery and it does last a long time, even on full brightness.  It's light.<br /><br />Con's: If it weren't for the trackpad this would be a 4 or a 5 star product.  Other cons: 12gb memory limit (you can do 20 gb if you're willing to buy a super expensive ($350) non-registered 16gb so-dimm from IM Memory), the bottom gets very warm (not hot) with moderate use and never seems to be fully cool."
2.0,Cute style/color but not durable at all. Didn't last long.
2.0,"I got this for my Lenovo Yoga 3 14&#34;.  It fit the laptop and a few accessories very well.  The shoulder pad is clunky and poorly designed so I got rid of it.  The clips are also a little awkward, and were partially responsible for the accident that broke my laptop screen.<br /><br />I was reaching to adjust the clip while the bag was on my shoulder.  The clip had twisted upside down.  It came undone after very little pressure and the bag fell from my shoulder.  It landed on fairly soft dirt, but the bag has almost no padding--particularly on the corners.  It fell not very far, and I assumed it was fine.  However when I got to work and pulled it out the corner of my touchscreen had cracked pretty badly.<br /><br />The bag is pretty good for carrying if you are careful of the clips, and it is a good slim size.  However it is not helpful for protecting your laptop."
2.0,Only one of them worked
2.0,The printing fades soooooo easily. Even worse on the keys you use often. Good concept just need better quality item.
2.0,"it did not meet my expectation , when i use the multi voltage port the power bank become really hot then went out of battery quickly"
2.0,"I loved how the keys are laid out nicely and it had the office style Enter key (not that fat reverse L type enter key) but I found it to be shoddily made as it easily flexes with the slightest amount of pressure and I have naturally acidic skin so no keyboard stands up to my typing (no, I have clean hands not gunky ones) but this keyboard's letters started to wear off in a month, or two, and after 10 months I have no A, and the S is almost gone and E is next to go then C and my M is starting to go.<br /><br />I thought from Logitech I would get better but that was the old Logitech not this new garbage they have been churning out for the last 6 or so years.  Now I am on here looking for a new keyboard so I would have to say I wasted my money but never again a Logitech as I know many who have had a ton of minor to major issues with the new Logitech stuff and this keyboard for me taught me to just stay away.  Probably rebadged Chinese garbage now."
2.0,"The bag is poorly made with extremely thin bonded Leather.  It looks great in the pic,  but it's a 19.99 bag at most."
2.0,"I bought this drive when it was on sale. I thought it was a good deal for the price, but I am disappointed in the drive's performance. Anytime that I copy a large file (over 1 GB) to the drive, the drive stops working partially through the transfer. If I take the drive out of the computer, it is really hot. Once it cools down again, the drive works. It doesn't seem to affect reading files, but it does make it rather useless to store data. I've tried 3 computers and all display similar results.<br /><br />I guess I should have known that I would have problems: I had used a similar 16 GB SanDisk drive before and it failed early as well. I will likely try to RMA this drive."
2.0,"The sleep/wake feature does not work,  the top cover doesn't want to stay in the rolled up position."
2.0,Charges fine doesn't like my USB port in my car for music though :-(
2.0,"I just reviewed this computer a few days ago. I said it was working well. As it turns out, the computer has no cmos back up if the computer is unpluged. The internal battery does not work or there is a motherboard problem. If the power goes out, date and time must to be reset. If not, I can't get back on line."
2.0,"+ 5 stars for being a great case.<br /><br />-3 stars for not specifying that the all the threads are metric. God forbid I live in the greatest nation on earth and need a case the uses 'merican units.<br /><br />Seriously, though, you cost me a lot of time, money, and effort trying to mount my current equipment with UTS standard screw sizes on a metric case. These are elementary specs you need to specify.<br /><br />Edit: I should also say that it didn't come with any screws, so it wasn't a simple matter of switching the screws out. If they had included mounting screws, I probably wouldn't have had so many problems."
2.0,"I hhate this keyboard.. II will not be correcting typos so that you can  see what i'm  deaaliing with . It duplicates keystrokes and is often oon a delay.  I wishh I would havve noticed it sooner becausee now it's too late to reeturn.  I have had the kkeyboard siince March and havve changed the battery twice.. No surprise, that does not fix the problem.  I gave it twoo stars because the moouse is actually kinda nice."
2.0,Was ok at first but within a year it broke.
2.0,"This protector creates a noticeable drop in sensitivity for the Acer ICONIA screen, to the point that children's fingers won't be able to register a &#34;drag&#34; across the screen.  I ended up removing the screen and taking my chances with the unprotected gorilla glass.<br /><br />Install was easy enough. You're going to have bubbles under the protector, and the included &#34;squeegee&#34; is worthless.  I ended up using a more rigid squeegee from another screen protector to complete the install.<br /><br />Item does not come in a rigid package, either.  It would be very easy for this to arrive bent, causing a permanent crease in part of your protector."
2.0,"While this cover is nicely priced, you get what you pay for. Within two weeks the case began cracking where you open the computer. Now, 3 months later several pieces have broken off. Great color, but it's got to go."
2.0,"The drive I got won't play my DVDs because it is set up for Region 2 and won't be changed. So I have to return it. It was able to run CD's fine, though."
2.0,"Updated review #2 (March 15th, 2016) - Becoming displeased with this item.<br />Following the March 12th  review I contacted the manufacturer (in China) to see if they could provide drivers or some other method to make it work on Win 10. Their response was that it DOES work. I have tried in on 5 different Win 10 machines, a Win 10 Surface and even a Win Server 2012 machine. It does not work on any of them. But when I plugged it into my Win 8 machine, it worked fine. The manufacturer indicated that should update to the latest USB drivers. Windows reports that I already have the latest driver! Here is the text of their reply:<br /><br />Dear Customer:<br />We have seen your message on orico.cc, per check with our Tech-team our product 2588US3 does support with WIN10 and it is just an enclosure and does not have special driver, it is drove by your PC USB drive ,you can update your USB driver or update your motherboard driver.<br />Any question please feel free to contact me, thank you.<br />Best Regards<br />Joseph<br /><br />To make matters worse, the reply came from a send only email address so I cannot even reply with my findings. (I suspect they simply do not care anyway.)<br /><br />On a positive note, I ordered a similar item from Amazon. It came in two days and works fine on all my machines.(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PL1SK8C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00)<br /><br />Updated review (March 12th, 2016) - Not quite so pleased!<br />While the drive worked as expected when connected to my Win 7 machine it is NOT functional under Windows 10. There are no custom drivers and it won't work with the generic USB Mass Storage driver. I spent several hours on the internet and with Microsoft tech support and finally determined that it just is not compatible,<br /><br />Original review:<br />Worked perfectly. All you have to do is slide the drive into the socket, put on the lid and connect the USB cable. I used mine to clone my OS drive using theincluded (limited functionality) copy of Acronis True Image. That too, worked flawlessly. It took about two hours, (probably because the machine only has USB 2.0 ports), but the result was a perfect copy.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the product, especially at the price."
2.0,"Wi-Fi is borderline unusable with Comcast, STAY AWAY!!!! Works great as a modem, I get download speeds over 100 mbps when I plug my ethernet directly into the device. Unfortunately, when I try to use the router functionality this device becomes completely useless. With my laptop directly next to the device and no other devices connected, I cannot get it to crack 5 mbps download. From my room about 10 feet away, I cannot crack 1 mbps. Seriously, just buy your modem and router separately, this device has horrible Wi-Fi features when used with Comcast. It's what I get for going cheap, buy higher quality modems/routers together in the future."
2.0,"the first one I bought (at Walmart, in the store) lasted a year, then just stopped working. This one worked great until very recently, and now the space bar sticks down- very awkward and unpleasant. I took it apart and could find nothing wrong, put it back together, very carefully, and the space bar was fine for a few hits, and now back to sticking down. Too late to return :("
2.0,Some of my pictures have color lines through them or you can only see the top of the picture and the bottom is grey? ???
2.0,"Even though I have used this brand and model of camera card before, this one would not format and I had to return it.  The usual speedy reimbursement from Amazon was appreciated."
2.0,Bad service and don't by it. Thank you so much
2.0,"No written directions came with it, and a week after I purchased it, it went on sale for $30.00 less, oh well. I'll give it to one of my grandkids."
2.0,"I was hoping that this case would protect my macbook but honestly, this case felt like a school lunch tray with a matte finish on the outside. The case comes in two parts: one for the bottom, and one for the top. The bottom was just the same piece of plastic designed to fit the bottom of the macbook air. The floral design isn't as crisp as seen in the picture shown and it's pretty heavily pixelated as it looks like someone tried to print the design with a printer running low on ink. Over all, I don't think the case is even worth the cheap price I paid."
2.0,Would not work and caused my computer to need to repair startup files after removing it to return it.
2.0,I don't like this keyboard much it types odd. But it was cheap.
2.0,"terrible. Bulky and the tab that holds the edge of my iPad bent. Seeing that it is cardboard underneath fake leather, there is nothing I can do to fix it."
2.0,One stopped working after a couple of days.
2.0,"The price gouging on the Origami covers is so incredibly abhorrent that Amazon should include a slip of paper inside with the famous quote credited to P.T. Barnum about there being one born every minute. Good quality compared to plastic cases, sure. But at this price, they should be made from hand-crafted Italian leather by a craftsman named Luigi. I do hope that when the Kindle buying frenzy calms down a bit, Amazon decides to price the accessories a bit more reasonably."
2.0,"The reason this router deserves two stars is because even after several months of availability the firmware still unstable. Features like readyshare and media server does not enforce password protection even if you set it to use password protection. Netgear Technical Support is extremely bad, specially if you are knowledgeable about networks and computers. Every question you make, they will put you on hold for 5 mins and then come with a dumb answer that will not fix the problem. This router is great for wireless connections and wired connections - but that's it! Don't try QoS or Dynamic QoS, Password Protection Folder Sharing, Access Control, or any other advanced feature, because it will not work or it will cause router issues like reboots or freezes. Hardware-wise its a great piece of technology but software-wise Netgear needs to start to develop software with QUALITY! I have until Sept 17th until Netgear fixes these issues. I'm using firmware V1.0.2.46_1.0.97  (Which I had to manually update by downloading the firmware from Netgear's support page) because the update feature of the router would not find the new firmware.)<br />If by Sep 17th Netgear do not at least give me a roadmap where these features will be fixed I will return this router and try D-Link."
2.0,Does not fit AC56U router
2.0,This mouse seems to lag alot and occasionally freezes up and I have to unplug it and replug it to get it to work again. For the money spent I am very disappointed.
2.0,This charger lasted me a couple months before the cord broke and it stopped working.
2.0,"I bought two of these adaptors principally due to the very low price. While the materials seem to be of good quality, one of the two has already failed after only a few months of very occasional use (I have had them for about 6 months). One is working fine still, but the other is causing the audio to be garbled and lower volume. I've tried reconnecting the plugs that are plugged into each end as well as trying different cables, etc and the results are the same. It's like something inside has come loose (cold solder joint maybe?).<br /><br />I can't say I can recommend these for this reason. As simple a device as this should be, it should not fail 6 months in especially given the low use of it and the pristine environmental conditions I use it in."
2.0,"While this laptop pad does move air and keeps the laptop cool, the design flaws are a real let down. I have a 17&#34; laptop and ordered the 17&#34; fan however my laptop hangs over the edge of each side by about an inch so it's not wide enough. The top surface is slippery and the laptop consistently slides down the front of the fan to the desk making it difficult to work. I have to push the laptop back over the edge so the rubber feet on my machine catch the back lip of the fan housing to hang it up from falling forward. The blue lights are always on. So annoying and really is this a necessary feature for a fan? Who needs to have blue glow from under their laptop?!! The final and most annoying flaw is the usb cord at both ends the wiring has come loose and bent so now I find myself not wanting to replace the wire but to purchase a whole new fan. The long and the short, the fan works great and keeps the laptop cool but the design and quality of product fail. I really wanted to like this product."
2.0,I don't like it. There is no Power connection for the laptop. I had to find a different solution.
2.0,"The product itself is fine, but it is not a 120hz monitor. When searching 120hz monitor in amazon this shouldn't be the second one that pops up because it isn't 120hz.  That being said the blame lays on me for not reading thoroughly that it was just a 60hz monitor but it shouldn't be advertised as such on amazon either.<br /><br />So good product just know it isn't 120hz."
2.0,"I own this with 8GB RAM. Performance is fine, outside of the Lenovo bloatware that you can't delete (reinstalls itself).  What drives me crazy is the jumping cursor problem. I can barely get through sentence without the cursor jumping somewhere, highlighting a bunch of text in deleting it. I have to pay close attention as I type. And I'm positive I'm not brushing the touchpad at all. I'm very close to throwing this thing in the trash. This will definitely be the last Lenovo I ever buy."
2.0,"Pairs with my phone; doesn't offer Dvorak.<br /><br />I requested this keyboard because I would like to be able to do more work on my phone, using a real keyboard.  The keyboard pairs just fine with an LG G4 phone.  However, I went through all the keyboard options, and I can't see anything that allows me to select the Dvorak layout.<br /><br />Typing QWERTY on a real keyboard is better than stumbling through the phone's screen keyboard, but only by a little.<br /><br />Someone else has pointed out that the actual key layout on this keyboard does not support full Dvorak, anyway.<br /><br />Could not find any useful support for the product."
2.0,I like the material and the handle. Also the memory card pocket and card slots come in handy while I travel. The sizing is just a little off causing the camera to be partially covered by the cover. When I use it to Skype I have to hold the tablet in place to allow my family to see more of me than the tablet cover. I have purchased another cover to replace this one.
2.0,"I have a , 2.0 USB  I didn't notice or even knew there is now a 3.0 drive. ; ("
2.0,"Background: I've owned 3 iPads (current is an iPad Air); I bought this model to replace a Logitech iPad keyboard/cover whose magentic hinge had broken (for the second time).<br /><br />My experience with the unit I bought is that it is very difficult to get the iPad back out of the 'clamshell' once you have placed it in there, instructions notwithstanding. Given how easy it is to crack the iPad screen, I am dismayed by the amount of pressure required to 'push [the] back cover off the iPad'; it requires much more than simple 'gentle' pressure on the two top corners. The fact that the clamshell top is permanently attached to the keyboard, yet is on a sliding extension,  makes it all the more awkward. I am abadoning this product and finding something else to use."
2.0,Still cannot use this with my automobile test app that originally uses the old iPhone 3 style plug
2.0,"Well, it does charge my Chromebook.  I didn't believe what the other reviewers said about it affecting the trackpad so I bought it anyway. My mistake! It really DOES make the cursor move erratically, I just use it for charging when the Chromebook is shut down. I hope It's not going to mess up the battery or some other component. I'll keep it as an emergency spare."
2.0,"I've used both the iPad and Samsung tablets.  Now I've used the HDX Fire 8.9.  Quite honestly, this device is useless as a tablet.  But I bought the HDX to watch movies downloaded from Amazon video for when I travel.  I love it for this function.  But I use my iPad for everything else.  The functionality as a tablet is simply lacking, so if you want a tablet, spend the $500 on either iPad or Samsung.  However, if your a prime member and need a device for watching content at 35,000 feet, this is a nice device.  Keep in mind, HD content will chew up about 4-5 GB for every hour of content.  Going with the 64 GB is recommended.  And Dear Amazon.....stupid idea to make customers pay to not receive ads on this device!!  If you had the best tablet on the market, I could maybe understand this tactic, but you don't."
2.0,"i just received it to day, i couldn't make it work in my window 7, it says drivers not found i even download online driver software still not working. help please"
2.0,"it is not easy to find 24 inch monitor with the rear feature to hang, becareful look for the monitor first, now I am screw up"
2.0,The Pi is great but the screws provided with the case were too small.  Had to bust out my own screw collection to mount the Pi into the case.
2.0,You get what you pay for. My camera demands that it be formatted every few power cycles. I guess it will be just a mass storage device from now on.
2.0,"Not impressed with these laptops at all which is sad since I've always had a high regard for Dell computers. Attempting to image these computers has been an exercise in futility, nothing has worked including Ghost, Fog, or Acronis. There is also a very loud and annoying &#34;pop&#34; from the speakers that is heard often when clicking the mouse on items."
2.0,"It worked great for the first few months.  Then started having issues with the touch screen.  Then the charging port went bad and I had to send it to ASUS for repair.  The charging problem was fixed but the touch screen issues were not.  It seems to be temperature sensitive-in cooler environments it functions properly but when it's warmer the touch screen won't work at all.  Also, the charging port that got replaced is going bad again.  This tablet would get five stars if it actually worked properly."
2.0,"There's little reason to doubt why anyone wants to buy this low budget option of 2.1 speaker is because of subwoofer. For the price, this isn't the worst, but it doesn't suit the demand or expectation of buyers either, in that regard. Subwoofer itself is flawed in my opinion, because it's speaker is placed on the bottom of the box, instead of front or side. However, that is not the most disappointing feature of the product, or lack there of as a matter of speaking fact. The biggest flaw of this speaker is that it did not separate subwoofer volume to stereo speaker's control. As a result, you either have to crank the volume to max or give up satisfying thump of subwoofer, and even when volume is maxed out, the subwoofer is buried deep between to the sound produced by stereo. Overall sound quality is quite nice, but it just is not an option you should choose if you seek to find that low-cost variant of subwoofer system that can still be satisfactory."
2.0,It's smaller than I'd expected and so lightweight that it tips.  It might be ok for a child.
2.0,The outside of this item felt cheap and flimsy. I removed the actual card and it works okay for what i need it for.
2.0,It still has a bad smell and the inside pads peeled out. Had to use some gorilla glue to fix them. I just use it as a fishing lure box.
2.0,"I've had the Wrath for a few years.  While the sound and comfort is excellent, they recently broke as the cheap piece of plastic at the base of the band, secured by two small screws, pulled through.  It is a minor problem right?  There are screws for removing and replacing parts giving the appearance that the unit is readily repairable.  However - Creative sells NO parts.  Check it out for yourself.  They offer no repair parts for their products.  If it breaks and it is out of the short warranty, then buy something new.  This is their tech support suggestion.  I will forever more steer clear of any Creative product."
2.0,"This isn't really a case; it's just several slices of lucite held together with *plastic* screws.  It doesn't fit well and the plastic has a strange, greasy film on it."
2.0,"Had alot of connectivity issues, causing me to have to detach and reattach the cover, but the extra battery boost is nice. the track pad is terrible"
2.0,"The keyboard I got is defective. The space bar intermittently becomes very hard to press.<br /><br />The price of the keyboard has gone up since I bought it, and the best Amazon can do is refund my original purchase price and make me buy a replacement for the new higher price. This is just in the last three weeks."
2.0,Seems like the magnet is not strong enough
2.0,"It looks nice and stands up nice but can not get to the edge of screen to swipe, cover gets in the way so had to remove it. It lays on a shelf as a unfortunate purchase for kindle 6 fire."
2.0,Junk. It's supposed to be for two in one yet you cannot open it with the bottom on.
2.0,did not fit proper
2.0,the case doesn't fit well and the keyboard cover just gets in the way making typing a hassle.  the color is great and it feels sturdy i just wish it stayed on my Macbook Air better
2.0,"one stick worked, the other didn't. will have to figure out the returns ordeal now."
2.0,"This is my first Kindle Tablet although I've used the Kindle and Audible programs for years.<br /><br />I have a Nook HD and a Kobo Aura but I was looking for a size a little bigger than my phone and smaller than my other tablets. When the 6 inch went on sale I got it.<br /><br />I've had it for three weeks and have used it nearly every day for mainly audio books.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />The screen though small provides vivid pictures and is super responsive. The Whispersync feature is a huge bonus for me and the one thing that will keep me with Kindle when all else fails. The selection of books and movies is staggering, which is what drew me to owning one.<br /><br />However there are some deficiencies I can't overlook. First, for a tablet so small it's extremely heavy. It's harder to hold up than my hardback copy of Gone with the Wind. It's heavier than my Nooh HD 7 inch and that has a protective case. Plus when you use it over an hour or so it gets hot...like burn-your-hands hot and I have to prop it up with a pillow instead of holding it. Then finally the audio book interface is less interactive then the downloaded version on my phone. As an readers I've never been impressed with Kindle. Nook and Kobo are far superior but the whispering technology was what set them apart. But if their tablet  isn't any better than the program I can download on my Nook, why would I purchase a Kindle?<br /><br />I expected better and was disappointed."
2.0,"My daughter was not pleased, so I don't known<br /><br /> what she will do with it."
2.0,Came halfway through a windows 10 upgrade.  It was in limbo without option to promote or succeed from the update.  Had to call microsoft to re attempt dailed update.
2.0,Cheap flimsy crap. It works but who knows for how long.
2.0,"Ended up not working with my MeMOPad, which I believe it said it was supported. Ended up throwing it away but I did like the design for what it's worth."
2.0,"This will charge my iPhone sometimes, but not others. This will not charge and iPad."
2.0,"usb extention was very cheap and split in half then wires disconnected. There is no memory in the stick. It is basically just an adapter which keeps messing with the picture quality on my laptop turning it green or red. After a week of finally installing it, it works but you can not move the laptop or the USB Stick will disconnect from the port causing the program to freeze."
2.0,This doesn't work with a touch screen laptop.  I'll be selling it cheap on EBay.
2.0,cheaply made
2.0,Nice for gaming but my USB 3.0 is not recognized by the computer and also I already tried to install the windows 10 twice and it weren`t able to complete both times. Also the sound sometimes is defective
2.0,I expected a fuller sound from speakers with four drivers of these dimensions.  I paid $25 and hoped they'd sound like $35.  Unfortunately I think they sound like $15 speakers.  I would not buy again.
2.0,"Still will continue to use the Jot pro, seems that the iPad isn't ready for a Bluetooth stylus, it is just not reliable enough yet. experienced alot of skipping issues."
2.0,I bought the cord because my original cord had a break in the wiring.  This one that I purchased also has a break in the wire - only at a different location so every now and then the power cord goes off and I lose what I am doing because the laptop has to be plugged in at all times when I am using it.
2.0,There are several discoloration spots on the sleeve I received
2.0,"Its small, it fits my 11 inch laptop perfectly across, and its 6 or 7 inches long,So many people bought this, and it was a better price than the larger ones"
2.0,"Because it's faceted, there is one corner that just doesn't fit well on the iPhone 5.  Overall, it barely fit and seemed to be always at the risk of popping off my phone with the slightest touch.  I returned it.  Too bad so cool looking."
2.0,"There is extremely little flexibility on facing your tablet with this device. Extremely disappointed. If your mic stand is just so, and the angle is just so, you're OK, but if you need to turn it at all, forget it. Piece of crap for my use (on a keyboard rig)."
2.0,One windows 7 pc wouldn't accept it so tried on another pc and it downloaded okay.
2.0,Zipper broke after two days of use.  I opened it four times.  One of the teeth fell out.  Still works to protect my pen in my bag but only because the pocket it is kept in is snug.
2.0,"I was so hoping these cords would work well with my iphone, but within a month they began to only charge sporadically.  It seems to be getting worse, so my guess is that within a month, they won't be working at all.  I constantly hear the &#34;ding&#34; going off in my phone telling me that it is connecting then disconnecting over and over.  Buy something else."
2.0,Quality is lacking and it wears out quickly.
2.0,"It looks and feels ok, but IT SMELLS, literally like gasoline. I've been waiting for 3 days to see if the smells goes away but it doesn't, it even leaves the smell in your fingers when you grab it."
2.0,"There are compatibility issues that are not mentioned. It states it is for a XBOX 360 but not that it is 1 of a series of 4 that could potentially be the same as the one in your XBOX, also that you have to either flash your XBOX or remove the circuit from the DVD drive of the old and new and swap them, which could consist of soldering."
2.0,The product was great then I noticed the charging port broke last week. I've only used it 4 times so I am a bit sad. I only charge it in my home and I don't believe I am forceful...very confused and concerned.
2.0,"Its appearance and screen color are good but some functions not work properly.  Many times, it suddenly lost the internet and said that there is not network but the network is there.  I have to logoff and logon again in order to reconnect the WIFI again.  The hand writing panel, sometimes, will be stuck and can not move the cursor to revise my writing.  I have to start another screen to complete it."
2.0,setup nightmare
2.0,"There are a lot of people complaining here that they received wrong battery and it doesn't fit.  I was one of them.  I have a Dell Inspiron 15R SE (7520),  a notorious power hog.  The seller on my original order was Easy Fine and I ordered from them because it was Prime and fulfilled by Amazon and in view of the problems of others, I figured it would be easiest to return.  (It was).  I decided to take another shot and ordered from the EPS Battery Store (actually lower price.)  I figured since they were fairly local, I could show up on their doorstep personally if I had to.  Battery has arrived.  Fits as specified.  Has the bulge for the extra 3 cells on the bottom so the screen opens fully.  Battery life has jumped from maybe 2 hours to 4.5.  Now the only question is durability but I won't know that for a while.  Hopefully, this saves someone else from having to go through the hassle some of us have.  Ok, it's 6 months in and performance has dropped considerably.  Getting less than 2 hours of life out of a full charge now.  Guess that's how they keep the price down. Either the cells are scavenged or new but poor quality."
2.0,"stopped being compatible with my macbook, i think after an update :["
2.0,"The modem I received did not work with Atlantic Broadband. The tech said I need to get a replacement. I had to rent a modem and pay for the technicians, so I'm out basically $50 even though I received a full refund."
2.0,Keys are broken!
2.0,"Had nothing but trouble with this router from the instant I plugged it in.  Read plenty reviews stating the same issues that I was having but decided to give it a shot anyway because of the specs and design.  The first thing I did was to update the firmware and then set it all up.  Had nothing but trouble with it from then on.  It randomly would isolate a device or two from the network and refused to let them connect, file sharing and Windows Homegroup could not connect or instantiate, I hooked up an external hard disk to the USB3 port and the router tried to fill it with software that keeps it active constantly (not only did it not work, but this will decrease the life of your external drive substantially) and never was able to get it shared properly across my network, the signal was wavering and intermittent (but when it was on, it was excellent), and it constantly interfered with other RF devices (such as disconnecting my wireless controllers for XBox One and PS3 and not allowing them to reconnect, screen share beaming from cellular devices couldn't connect, etc), it was also plagued with constant restarts.  I would be confused as to why I was disconnected from the internet, only to look over and see the router was restarting itself.  After 2 days of fighting with it, I thought to myself, &#34;Why am I putting forth so much time and effort to just get this thing to work after all the money I paid?&#34;, and that afternoon it went back to Amazon."
2.0,"This comment is more about the seller Link-Tronics Memory of Santa Ana than the laptop itself. Be selective in who you order a used one from and realize it’s hit or miss in what you may receive. If I did it again I would make sure I got a Dell refurbished laptop instead of a used one.<br /><br />I left a negative comment for LinkTronics memory and they replied to the comment offering me to return the laptop for a replacement (no refund offered). Since I only paid $218 plus shipping, and the laptop functioned OK, I decided to keep it anyway and fix it up myself. I was also leery about what I might receive as a replacement, and this laptop had a 1600x900 resolution and discrete graphics – I was expecting lower resolution and integrated graphics.<br /><br />After seeing many 5 out of 5 star reviews for them on Amazon, I ordered a Dell E6420 laptop off Amazon.com from Link-Tronics Memory, 12630 Westminster Ave., Santa Ana. The laptop was advertised by Link-Tronics as “very good” condition. The laptop had a large dent on the top of the case this dent was possibly from shipping I don’t know, several small dents around the edges of the top case that were not from shipping, a large (white with black text) metal tag super glued to the top of the case tracking it against theft and someone’s initials were written on the bottom of the laptop in permanent marker.<br /><br />The laptop had no hard drive screws in it. The hard drive fell out of the side of the laptop when I picked it up. The DC jack was loose. I bought a new case top and bottom cover and another DC jack from ebay. When I disassembled the laptop to replace the DC jack, 5 out of the10 palm-rest screws were missing.<br /><br />Once I had the laptop apart and tried to remove the motherboard, the top left motherboard screw was missing and it appears that the motherboard is super glued onto the daughterboard/case at that point and can not be removed from the laptop, unbelievably. When reassembling it I was also unable to put a screw into that screw hole (it’s filled with glue apparently?). It turned out that the DC jack was actually loose because the DC jack bracket holding it in was bent and loose but I put in the new DC jack anyway and straightened the bracket to make it tight.<br /><br />I bought a laptop screw kit to replace the missing screws, replaced the DC jack, replaced the top case cover with a new one and the bottom case cover with a slightly used one from ebay. I replaced the 320GB 5400 RPM hard drive in it with a 750GB 7200 RPM drive, and installed 8 GB of new RAM to replace the 4 GB it came with.<br /><br />After all the extra time, work and money spent the laptop overheated and shut down after one hour of use. Then I discovered that Dell used a thermal pad between the GPU and heatsink on their E6420 laptops, and the thermal pad was missing from this laptop. So then I bought a used Dell double-heat sink (made for the E6520 but also fits the E5420) to replace the single heatsink it came with and I used copper shims to replace the GPU thermal pad and re-thermal pasted everything again.<br /><br />FINALLY…after several weeks of waiting for parts, several hours of working on it, and spending another $100+ on parts I have a nice looking, great working laptop. The battery however appears to be worn out and I only get one hour and 40 minutes from the battery with light use. I just hope I never have to remove the motherboard as it seems to be super glued into the laptop."
2.0,This cable is very cheap and the quality is not the greatest very difficult to make cables out of because the wire inside is so flimsy and the jacket is thinner than normal network cables so when you do get an ending it doesn't crimp tight on the jacket portion
2.0,The fan clearly states that it is a 2 Watt fan. I removed a 1.1W from my computer and am not sure that this will function properly. It's very loud compared to the other fan that I removed. Hopefully it doesn't cause problems in the future. I have a early 2011 Macbook Pro 2.2 Ghz.
2.0,Standby battery life sucks
2.0,"The directional pad and the media buttons should be swapped. That makes it kind of uncomfortable. Also two of my keys take more pressing to activate. Aside from that, it works and at good distance."
2.0,The headset I bought workded for about 3 weeks then the adapter cable broke and it is hard to use I have to put it in the right way and set it down carefully and I would like a new headset please.
2.0,I've had it on my laptop for a week and one of the rubber grips on the bottom already fell off!
2.0,The description did NOT make clear that it isn't a piggyback pocket but literally two short pockets.  Therefore a &#34;normal&#34; sized COM will not fit.
2.0,"Everyone is DIFFERENT. I may be a cult of one, but I did not like the Das 4 Keyboard. I returned the Das and bought a Deck 87.<br /><br />Everything I like about the Deck 87 the Das lacked. The Deck is backlight. The Deck is much smaller. The Deck has a much more forgiving feel to it.<br /><br />The Das for the Mac is more &#34;Mac-like&#34; out of the box. With the Deck 87 you must rearrange some of the keys using System Preferences."
2.0,It works when it wants.
2.0,Didn't fit. Too big.
2.0,Don't waste your money. Doesn't put out cool air and sounds like a toy hair dryer. Not impressed.
2.0,"The battery needed to be charged be I could use it. Also, it was difficult recharging the battery"
2.0,Stopped working after a couple of months 😔
2.0,The screen protectors were about 2.5 MM more narrow than the LCD so the edge lit up and looked a bit odd.  I wrote the seller about it asking for guidance and got no response so I returned them.
2.0,"I didn't really need a screen protector that goes all the way to the edges; I just wanted to remove the mirror like quality of the screen.<br /><br />I'm very good at installing these things (I use a &#34;clean&#34; bathroom with no dust etc. air spray bottle etc.) and this time was no exception but it is impossible to remove bubbles when the edges of the guard are flush with the screen—air invariably creeps in under the edge and once it gets in there is no way to reseal it. I tried to cut the borders with a very sharp X-Acto blade but imagine my surprise when I peeled off the cover film to discover that the screen guard was just as glossy as my screen!<br /><br />Pretty useless, all told."
2.0,"I attend a lot of meetings at construction sites for my job and my notes are a very important aspect. I recently acquired an iPad to replace my laptop while out in the field, for practical reasons.<br />I wanted to see if I could make the switch from paper notes to taking notes on my iPad.<br />After extensive research and having read countless reviews, I pulled the trigger on the Jot Script 2 in conjunction with the Goodnotes app.<br />Unfortunately I have to conclude that there is no efficiency gain to be made by using the stylus compared to pen & paper.<br />The stylus writes pretty accurate in Goodnotes but there is always an ever so slight lag, which gives the whole experience an unnatural feeling.<br />The times I tried to use the stylus in the field, I soon gave up and grabbed pen & paper.<br />Drawbacks I've experienced were:<br />Taking a quick note is practically out of the question, the stylus is most likely off and not paired by the time you want to use it.<br />The battery seemed to drain whether or not the stylus was turned off, most likely the side switch had been pushed inadvertently while in my bag or pocket. A number of times I was unable to use the stylus due to a drained battery.<br />The lack of pocket clip is a serious design flaw. Put it down on a table and I guarantee you it will be on the floor soon. I would love to hear Adonit's product designer's explanation for this.<br />General conclusion: though it is a well-made and generally clever product, it cannot be practically used for what it is generally advertised.<br />I returned it to Amazon."
2.0,Over all for music files it wasn't bad but once I started saving my video and pictures on it it created corrupted files. My whole Disneyland and six flags vacation  was unreadable. Huge disappointment
2.0,The rubber tip is too small and I have to tap things twice a lot of times.
2.0,"I would give it a better review, had I know that the power adapter wont work on 240V 50 Hz. I move around the world and it nice having a good router to hook up my wireless devices to. Now I will have to carry a step-down transformer to use this or just leave it a home and continue to take my Belkin with me."
2.0,Worked the first time with my dvi screen but now doesnt detect it or allow my screen to be used with my laptop
2.0,Can't get it to fit sucks just buying better fans next time
2.0,"after a while of using this case, i realized that it did more damage than good. the top part is great, but the bottom one is not. I noticed this case has left permanent stains on the bottom of my laptop. I would not recommend this product to someone who plans on using it for over 2 months."
2.0,"I purchased a Steelseries Apex keyboard. The minimal documentation ( two 4x4 pieces of paper)  that comes with it says the User Manual is located on their site. I have been unable to locate it. It would seem that it would be located in an obvious place since it is not included. The site is not at all user friendly. The keyboard itself seems to be fine, but if I can't get a manual to be able to utilize the features than it is pretty useless. I can just purchase a standard keyboard."
2.0,"edit: (October 2017)<br />Does not work with Windows 10, screen refuses to work with Windows 10, works with Windows 7 & 8. Cord is holding up, but I also haven't moved it in years, and have taped it in multiple places. (Problem is not with the Windows 10 computer, I have hooked another monitor up to it, the Cintiq essentially functions as an overpriced, bulky Intuos at this point).<br />If you don't move this thing, then you're fine, but just throwing this out here, I emailed customer service in August 2015, still no answer lmao<br /><br />edit: (February 2016)<br />Again, the cord has shattered. This is partially my fault, but the cord was going (constant disconnections like before). Now here's the catch. There's /AGAIN/ no cords stocked currently. The tablet I've had for maybe a year and a half is unusable /AGAIN/ just because they don't use a cable that works. (And before you ask, it tipped off my desk after I tripped on the cord in the dark, so yes, that's 100% my fault).<br /><br />However, the cord situation hasn't been fixed, I'm dropping another star. This is a $1k tablet, the least they could do is keep the cables in stock or get a replacement cable in Wal Mart or something.<br /><br />I'm going to finally review this. The one thing you need to know: This IS the best one there is.<br />(btw I purchased the Wacom Cintiq 13HD non touch).<br /><br />It does come w/ problems though. For one, Wacoms driver section is cluttered. The CD version I had worked, but moving to a CD-portless laptop finding it was a chore (but findable). The tablet is good, can work in any condition really. I love it (when it decides it wants to work).<br /><br />However, I've had this for about a year and a half now. The cord stopped working. I contacted Wacom in FEBRUARY of 2015. It is now the end of August 2015 and still no answer. I'm sorry but that is unacceptable. My Cintiq is no longer on warranty (I'm still waiting for customer support lol), so now I have to buy a new cord ($35 DOLLARS!!!-no free shipping too). and have it shipped (When Wacom decides they want to stock them-October 1st they say as of now). so my $1000 tablet is now useless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Best tablet on the market<br />-Great pressure sensitivity<br />-Great screen, not too heavy<br />-Came in a really nice box and great for storage<br />-Really nice pen (comfy grip).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cord is breakable if you even slightly move it. (I keep it on my desk)<br />-Cords are NOT restocked and can leave you w/ a broken tablet in the middle of something. (Cords have been out of stock since at least July).<br />-Wacoms support (I used e-mail) gives no response. If you have a hardware issue it's not &#34;oh let me help&#34; it's &#34;no you installed the drivers wrong install them again&#34; (which is bad, very very bad).<br /><br />So please just take this to mind. I'm going to end up buying a new tablet and just uninstalling these drivers until they ship in new cords b/c this is infuriating.<br /><br />But yeah 2 stars off entirely for clunky hardware & cord, as well as bad support. Sorry but I cannot give this product anything higher until the cord situation is fixed and stock restocked regularly.o response.

2.0,"After ordering a 6th gen. cover by mistake, the 7th gen. cover was a letdown.  Although the material it is made of feels the same, the cover seems to be not as sturdy (more flimsy) and there is no magnetic clip to hold the cover closed (like on the 6th gen. cover).  I'm now going to have to figure out how to keep this thing closed so that it isn't always turning on when the cover opens accidentally.  I called Amazon to complain about this cheaper version of cover as the cost is the same as the 6th gen. cover.  My opinion - if you can, stay away from this one and find another that is better.  If you need a 6th gen. cover, I say go for it - 7th - NO (not at this price)."
2.0,Doesn't stay charged very long.
2.0,"As so many others have pointed out the obvious pros/cons of this extender I will only add one point and then ask a question.<br />This device is nice because the Dragonfly sticking out of a USB hub is an accident waiting to happen. I like having the Dragontail to remedy that situation.<br />My question is this: When I use the DragonTail with my Dragonfly, the first 5-6 seconds of the first song played gets cut off. Every time. Has anyone else had this issue? Tech support at AudioQuest was very helpful, but it was only after I checked to see if I had sufficient RAM and that my drivers were updated, and that it was not an issue with my headphones or stereo, that I decided to remove the DragonTail, which solved the problem immediately. On that basis I give this device 2 stars. I need it, but it messes up the audio playback. That's no good."
2.0,"I bought this in late March, 2015. Now, late August 2015, it broke. It only lasted 5 months."
2.0,"Typing on the keyboard works fine once I get it paired with my Winbook tablet but that can take some time of trial and error. Within 60 days (after the warranty expired) the tracking pad stopped working. I now have to tab down or touch my screen to move the mouse which is a bit cumbersome. Also, disappointed there isn't more on line help regarding this product and virtually no instructions."
2.0,Not bad but the i-pad 2 has a camera
2.0,"The battery has to be perfectly placed partially out of the slot in the back in order for the mouse to work.  When that is the case the mouse works well, but overall its a pretty big hassle."
2.0,not charging any more after 2 months. The head is big so it won't fit if there is cover. iPhone6 complaint not compatible.
2.0,"The wipes are individually wrapped instead of having a pull out dispenser. They are just OK, not great. The biggest problem is that they smear the oil on the screen, instead of removing it. The only way to clean the screen with the wipe is to rub very hard, which can't be good for the screen over time.  I would choose a different brand the next time."
2.0,Speedy delivery and item comes as described. It also works. Give one confidence in doing business with this seller.
2.0,Being a women wasn't to thrilled with the look. It also had a magnetic closing and messed with the Asus.

2.0,"For about $25 you can get a true 64GB microSD memory card. For about half that price, you will invariably get a fake.<br /><br />*** YOUR DATA IS AT RISK ***<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Good 64GB SD cards are out there, but they will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.e information."
2.0,this was a flop! i was so sad because it is cool looking and the idea of it is awsom.  The working aspect of it  not so much. The repeat function on the keys would get stuck. it would do it so often I had to replace it with a old keyboard.  No lights no lcd buttons...... I know call the razer guys.  I thought yes they are gamers too they will help.  No they told me I couldn't even send it in for them to look at ??????<br />Sorry i wanted to like it but no. think twice before you do! cool looking doesn't mean it works and the is what a gamer needs
2.0,"The black case is Great quality, but the Miami Heat insert was WAY TO CHEAP"
2.0,"Only plays music, it doesn't charge iPhones!"
2.0,"Great price for 5GB but boy is this drive loud.  I've been in IT 19 years and this is one of the loudest drives I've heard.  I had a quiet computer before I put this drive in but it is quiet no longer.  It gets hot too.  Granted, I was transferring 3TB of data to it in one shot but it was nearly too hot to touch.<br /><br />I'd return it if I hadn't already done my data shuffle and moved the existing drives to different computers.  Once I see a WD Black for a reasonable price I'll be moving this drive to an enclosure for archiving only so I'll rarely hear it banging and clanging."
2.0,The base is flimsy and the magnetic buckle does not stay closed.  Plus the buckle will not stay to the back of the case when using the iPad; flips forward on the iPad surface.

2.0,"Great idea, but extremely poor execution. I have two of these pens. Both are not working properly; one is completely dead, and the other has a bad display. I would not recommend these pens unless they are brand new, and you don't mind dealing with bad hardware, poorly written software, and below average customer support. I think they can do better. Livescribe, it would be nice if you offered extended support for your products.<br /><br />Notice my pen below. It is fully charged and on...the display is black---this is the 2GB Pulse Pen. It has actually had very little use, and still looks brand new."
2.0,these are a great idea but don't work

It's slow in opening apps and it always say....  apps have stopped working or not responding...tried rebooting and resetting, uninstalling and reinstalling apps, work well for a few days, then start back acting up. I would not recommend this tablet to anyone!"
2.0,The case itself is okay. The real problem is the inside flap that folds under the tablet to secure it in place is too bulky. It is secured by velcro but the velcro strips are so thick it bulges making it hard to close the case.
2.0,"UPDATE: I am past the warranty but should have swapped for a cooler that had a new fan.  It's difficult to tell how much dust will settle between the fins of this heatsink until you have blown clouds out with air, wiped clumps physically from edges, and still can swab endlessly with 91% Isopropyl without the lint-free tissues coming away less filthy. I am having serious thoughts about my next investment in cooling being an easy-to-view liquid system that would not hold so much dust against my processor in difficult-to-reach areas.  Still, I realigned the fins and and did what I could to clear blockage behind the fan and remounted it for what is likely to be its final few days--unless I am pinching pennies for my side-project cooling.<br /><br />Pre 11-2015:<br />I am pleased with the performance of this cooler; it fits in the Corsair case I am using and only eliminated one of my fans.  The heatsink covers much of my mainboard and can be an issue; the fins can bend from cables pressing on them and it makes plugging fans into my M5A97 R2.0 a task for needle-nosed pliers.  My biggest complaint for this cooler is the dust it collects and how cleaning it can be a chore; this was before a gap was found and repaired between my AC and register; that brought extra dust into the room that was filtered by my EVO."
2.0,"It doesn't do what I bought it to do... It arrived on time and was nicely packaged.  I bought it to act as a hub between my TimeCapsule and my LaCie Porsche Design P'9233 USB 3.0 Desktop Hard Drive.  My old Anker hub stopped working after about a year and I thought maybe it was just fluke, but my external hard drive doesn't even show up on my network with this new hub.  I tried a different, smaller external hard drive and that also did not show up.  The only thing that showed up on my network when plugged into this Anker USB Hub, which was plugged into my TimeCapsule, was a thumb drive.  I tried several of the standard plugs and all of the IQ plugs."

2.0,"first, you have too much money.<br /><br />Second, you need to rethink how you'll spend it. No matter what applications you're looking to tackle this computer is about 300% of what it should cost. The components are not anywhere near this expensive. What you should do instead if you need something this intense is simply build your own computer. It's way, way easier than you probably think it is - and you will be infinitely more satisfied once it's done than you ever would be with this.<br /><br />LinisTechTips is a great resource for<br />learning to build the pc if you need a run through on the basics. Even if it seems complicated at first - the process itself will not be. All there really is to it is getting compatible parts and plugging them into the motherboard and PSU.<br /><br />If you're still scared after all of this and know you want a pre-build, fine. But DON'T get this one. Computers built by, say, iBuyPower, are still overpriced but not nearly as much as any alienware.<br /><br />Don't buy this computer. It's a phenomenal waste."
2.0,"I had to return it because although described to fit my Kindle, it did not.  So far I am please with my first time's Amazon's return procedure.<br /><br />I have ordered a replacement which seems to have a better description."

2.0,"I loved my original fire, which I use to supplement the iPad if my husband is using it. With Amazon's July &#34;sale&#34;, I thought why not pick up another one as the original did start gradually getting laggy. I'm afraid it doesn't hold the same quality.  Poor battery life in comparison. Volume isn't as loud, and I don't care for the placement of the buttons. (Volume, on/off, etc) for the price, it's ok, but they've gone down in quality, and I don't expect it to last. Too bad my original requires frequent &#34;reboot&#34;. Doesn't compare to the iPad at all"
2.0,Cheaply built - You get what you pay for.
2.0,"I don't do a lot of writing on the ipad mini, but I needed something for some quick email writing and such. Plus, the external keyboard allows for more screen space. A few problems.<br />1. When the mini is inserted in place, it's impossible to reach control center by swiping up from the bottom. Because that area is covered by by the frame. This is something I frequently use to set the device in airplane mode when I am not using it, and saving battery life. It gets pretty frustrating within a few times of trying.<br />2. No user manual of any sort came with the product. So, figuring out some basic tasks like turning the backlight on/off, changing the colors, learning about sleep mode - no luck. Zagg's web site doesn't help either. All it provided was promotional videos.<br />3. The video on the Amazon listing shows you can quickly turn the ipad around to use it in reading mode. But that's easier said that done. I had to push the ipad in really hard to properly seat in place, without worrying about it falling off. Plus, it was too heavy to hold the ipad + keyboard in reading mode for long anyway.<br />4. Once in a while, some of the keys wouldn't register action. Maybe this was a problem with the unit I got, and a replacement might have been better, but with all the other problems, didn't make sense to pursue further.<br /><br />So, off it back to Amazon.

2.0,"Love the keyboard, kind of hate the mouse...<br /><br />Legitimate question... Who at Logitech decided that this mouse/keyboard combo should have a mouse with a wheel that spun with resistance, had &#34;stops&#34; (for lack of a better word) that you had to bump over while trying to scroll smoothly, and made a whirring/clunking noise while scrolling? Is this some kind of &#34;improvement&#34; on something that already worked just fine?<br /><br />I am tempted to send it back as defective but I am pretty sure that what I find unpleasant is a design feature, and I LOVE this keyboard. For now I'll use another USB port for a less aggravating wireless mouse but it seems a shame."

I told them I was not going to pay for them to help me with a defective product and asked to speak to a supervisor. They came back on the phone and offered me a replacement. Although the outcome was positive I would not purchase a Netgear product again. it's not reliable and I don't care for a company that will charge me to help me with their products."

2.0,"First, it's a beautiful case. I got the tree themed case, very pretty in person. I received my kindle paper white and this case on July 3. It's August 28 now and probably about two weeks ago the hard shell that your kindle sits in separated from the outer case. I could probably re-glue it down, but I am sure it would just keep coming apart. I would give this 5 stars if it was a more durable product. For reference, I read on it about an hour daily. Sometimes more on my days off...so I consider that somewhat light usage and would expect the case to hold up better than it has. FYI, getting the kindle out of the hard shell of this case was kind of a pain. I had to really work to get it out. My advice would be to save your money and not purchase this particular case. I have since purchased a Fintie case and I think it will work much better for my needs."

Definitely not worth the price, esp. with the energy / electricity lost in heat."
2.0,the battery doesnt last more than 4 hrs not as advertised when the battery finishes and you plugged in the charge it doesnt turn on till after a few minutes that the battery starts charching the sleep mode drains out all the battery in a few hours.... look for lenovo yoga 2 much better computer.
2.0,I was very disappointed with my kindle. I bought it so I could read my college ebooks and the Kindle doesn't support the books. I haven't decided if I want to keep it for my fun books. I'm not happy that my Kindle ebook doesn't work with a brand new kindle.
2.0,"Maybe this stand work for some laptops. I have a Samsung R540 and I can't get the stand to work without either: 1) Pressing up against the power adapter plug, or 2) sliding the stand to the middle of the laptop, which put the laptop at too high an angle.<br />Interesting concept, but just doesn't work for my Samsung or my wife's Dell. It does work great with an old ThinkPad that I had laying around,<br />Bottom line: if your laptop is squarer than square, this stand will work. Otherwise, find another option."
2.0,Some of the stitching is coming undone but it's cheap so that's to be expected. I don't care for the &#34;Amazon basics&#34; logo on the bag as it screams &#34;this is cheap&#34;. The small series of pockets don't fit the length of an average pen... Which is weird.Oh well. I needed a bag for my laptop.
2.0,"Operated flakey, I replaced them with the cables that came with my Asus mother board, which worked better than these (!!)."
2.0,did not work
2.0,"seems slow, using it with my car's head unit, and this one seems to take longer to read then full size USB's"
2.0,"Bought this at 16.99 and it's incredibly cheap. Falls apart when you try to rotate it around, and made out of super cheap materials."
2.0,"The chemical odor was so strong that it filled my living room as I tried to air it out. If it weren't for that, it was still much too big for my Dell XPS 13&#34;. Returned."
2.0,"Battery life sucks on this... Promised a week, more like 4 hours.."
2.0,Wifi kept on dropping
2.0,"These do NOT operate at USB 3.0 drives per the hd_speed utility i use. Also, ONE lanyard for TWO drives, really?! The only thing i like is their form factor."
2.0,"Rugged durable case, but the cover corners break off with normal use.  An attempt to get a replacement was a joke.  I sent six pictures from various angles clearly showing the defect, and kept getting jerked around.  I finally gave up bought another case from another company.  It's really too bad that this company would rather lose a customer than replace a $2 plastic part"
2.0,Newer MacBooks and most PC's only. Older macs need not apply.
2.0,"I ended up using this mouse for work instead of gaming. It's generally functional and works well enough. I gave it  2 stars because of the damn button behind the mouse wheel. I like to play games that require extreme response time which often means I'm frantically spamming the mouse buttons. I would often accidentally bump that button and it would bring my game play to a halt. For me (on a mac) this button slows the mouse speed down to roughly 10% of normal mouse speed. It's almost like using an old ball mouse as I'm picking it up and moving it across the mouse pad a s quickly as possible just to get my pointer to move 15 inches across my screen. Of course, you can hit the button again to disable it and resume gameplay as normal. But, for me, that was too long and often resulted in negative results in gameplay. Since the mouse comes with no software to program the buttons I wasn't left with many options other than to buy another mouse. I even considered trying to pry the button out of the mouse just to get rid of it. I really can't see many uses for this button. Perhaps if you're playing an FPS which requires you to be super responsive unless sniping or something of that nature this feature could be useful. For me, playing mostly MMORPGs, it was extremely distracting and detracted from my gameplay experience."
2.0,"This mouse had potential! It's extremely comfortable, and the build quality is good. I love the palm rest and the button layout is great. However, it has a few glaring flaws with it that make this mouse unusable for me. First and foremost, it jitters, making it impossible to use for gaming. I primarily play League of Legends, and when your cursor suddenly stops working right it's very easy to lose track of it, which is a huge problem. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it's very annoying and usually causes me to die. Any amount of jitter is inexcusable in a mouse that advertises itself as a &#34;gaming mouse&#34;. Another problem this mouse has is the placement of the DPI button. The way the mouse is held causes your middle finger to lie very close to the DPI button, and it's pretty easy to accidentally hit it when gaming. Not a huge deal, but also very annoying.<br /><br />I also think the way these reviews are configured is pretty dishonest. The 2000 reviews are not for any one particular mouse, but rather all of them averaged together. Since when has that been okay? Anyways, from my experience I'd suggest against this mouse. I may have gotten a lemon, but even a replacement would still have the horrible DPI button placement, so I'll be going a different route."
2.0,not happy my monitor came with a lot of back light bleed
2.0,The case is fine.  The color is more of a burnt orange..
2.0,The product didn't last very long.  I only used it for 2 months and not very often at that and it stopped working.
2.0,"My Kindle works great for the first eight months, then my battery quit charging completely. The only time I can use it is if it's plugged into a wall. As soon as I unplugged from the wall, it loses its charge. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"Boy, were these garbage.  One cable was DOA.  The other died within 6 weeks of purchase."
2.0,"I decided to go with this model because it specifically had a 2K resolution ans 144hz refresh rate. I went through two of these monitors. The first one I got with all of my excitement built up was dead right out of the box. Powered on but not display a single thing. Went through the return process and got another one a few days later and got it all up and working which you would think is great, however only after about a week of use, a yellow line displaying from top to bottom of the LCD was stuck as a massive eye sore to anything I was doing on my computer. There was absolutely no solution for it and the warranty process through acer was a nightmare just to getting started with them so I didn't send it in. Now, I could of gotten a THIRD replacement, but I decided to go with an Asus monitor as this model gave me issues that rendered this monitor with great &#34;specs&#34; a reminder of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; I can see now why the price was pretty cheap for the bells and whistles I was asking for. The only reason this review is 2 stars is because it showed me it can do what it was advertised to do, but only for a short period of time before a problem arose. PS: The Asus ROG Swift 27&#34; Monitor is a fantastic product."
2.0,"I received the XD card inside [plastic cover case, which was inside of a plastic ziplock bag. I have been purchasing New XD cards for the past 6-8 years and I have never received one that was not inside of a regular cardboard sealed package. It appears that this card was not new. The XD card was also not fitting right in the plastic case that it was in."
2.0,Very disappointed.  After getting all set up this thing goes dark in about a quarter of the screen.  Returned it and bought a Viewsonic instead.
2.0,I Wipl be reviewing my friends<br /><br />It is build like a tank<br />An lot con is the command key has to be corrupt glued
2.0,"Expected a whole lot more.  First, the user interface of this modem/router is very non-intuitive.  The wireless will operate in 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz but only one frequency can be functional at a time.  This was a big disappointment considering the older wireless router I was attempting to replace provided true dual band operation.<br /><br />As others have reviewed on the retail version of this product, the wireless functionality is unreliable.  After 2 days in operation, wireless devices unable to connect requiring a hard reboot of the device.  My older Netgear router would go 4-5 months without issue.  In a way, I'm glad these issues surfaced early so I could return it."
2.0,Mine developed a short after a few months. You get what you pay for
2.0,"its a very nice case, although it doesn't cover the edges of my laptop, other than that its good."
2.0,Got a hole after two uses.
2.0,"They were good for the month that they worked. Now, two of the three cables have become unreliable just 5 weeks after I purchased them. You can make them work but they have to be angled just right to work. This comes after nothing but very light usage (these cables have only been used by my wife's nightstand and mine, as well). We have not traveled with the cables; we have not used them strenuously.<br /><br />Why a two star rating? They did arrive in a timely manner and I did enjoy the price. But, the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Covers up the charging port, and the stand mechanism is so stiff it keeps falling down"
2.0,mine did not work when i received it. the only reason its 2 stars is because I was able to return it very easily and got my money back quickly.
2.0,"This is a nice keyboard unless you are a touch typist.  Note the position of the right shift key and page up key.  I constantly find myself accidentally  hitting the up arrow when intending to hit the shift key.  The product works, but not for me.  I will be ordering a new keyboard and paying more attention to the key placements."
2.0,Its a good piece but is not working with my tv to watch movies
2.0,"Haven't use it as a router yet but it's an awesome extender. I'm reaching speeds equivalent to my wired desktop (50mbps and full bars) in a semi dead zone within my house where other extenders would only give me about 12mbps download speeds and 3 bars. Can't speak highly enough about it. For$99 plus $25 Amazon card, you would be hard pressed to find any other product that offers these kind of specs along with this type of consistant performance.<br /><br />Update: 5g keeps disappearing and weather app doesn't work despite firmware update. Very unstable after 4 months of use. Absolutely no customer support. Severely downgraded to 2 stars."
2.0,"Absolutely love the idea behind the Kindle for kids, just poor, poor execution.  Please give us parents of younger kids (mine are 3 and 5) a way to prevent our kids from downloading any and all apps.  From the moment I delete all of the apps they have touched throughout the day (which eventually locks up the device), it's loaded up again in minutes.  Deleting the apps isn't easy, either.  Sometimes they get stuck downloading, or just show an exclamation point or look downloaded but aren't.  Either way, they aren't easy to get rid of.  Amazon puts a password protection on the settings, just put the option to have one on the apps, too!"
2.0,"I was installing my first piece of software with this, and right around the end it spit the disc out and stopped the installation."
2.0,"I bought a Arkon Center Extension Car Headrest Tablet Mount for my Samsung ATIV Tab 3 (10.1 inch tablet computer) on May 3, 2015. I was very satisfied with the mount and I had used it for travels last summer without any problem. However, 2 weeks ago, I recognized that the holes in the post knobs became bigger and the knobs screws could not be securely held in the post knobs.. (the screws could be pushed out or in by just touching the knobs). Therefore, the mount could not be securely fastened to headrest. I don't want to use this anymore, because non-securely fastened mount may fall or fly during drive and may hurt my kids.<br /><br />-------Update on Sep. 10, 2015-------------------------------<br />After contacting the customer service department, the manufacturer (Arkon) sent me new knobs screws for replacement for free. I am satisfied with the customer service. However, I am not sure if the new knobs are strong enough to hold the mount to head rest securely. I hope the new screws are stronger than the previous parts."
2.0,it wasn't the right one. I returned it.
2.0,"Was sent the new and improved version of this after my first purchase broke under warranty.  The problem was the plastic in the hinge between the keyboard and the screen support snapping off at the hinge.  New Trent claims to have fixed this by making the part metal.  I noticed now that the new case will not close and secure with the Ipad 2.  There is a gap preventing the clasp to catch onto the other half of the case.  Recently, my son rotated the screen which put the clasp on the bottom near the keyboard.  The clasp snapped off easily in this position, so now there really is no way to close the case.  (See photos of gap and snapped off clasp in the correct position, and snapped off clasp in the rotated position near keyboard).  Bottom line, still some issues with materials and workmanship/design in this case.  It starts to show anywhere from a few weeks to a month or two.  The keyboard works great, and the mechanism that slides the screen hinge in and out from under the keyboard was improved, but overall materials continue to be questionable."
2.0,It only works half the time
2.0,Sound terrible anytime volume is tuned further than 1/2 way up.
2.0,eh o well
2.0,sent back ... ipad wouldn't work with it .. had a new screen put on ipad thru computer pro and they didn't install right the reason the case wouldn't work with ipad  .. had no problem returning case .. Computer Pro argued it was the case but a different type of case wouldn't work either  ..  they would not redo the screen job even tho they messed it up
2.0,"It will work. It has some annoying problems I am sure can be fixed with firmware, software, and support site updates. Nothing is so inherently flawed that I would scream don't get it, but I expect better when spending $500 plus dollars between motherboard and process, nevermind RAM, heat sink, etc. to upgrade a system.<br /><br />I will write give another star when they fix the BIOS problems. I should probably take two stars away for this one, but even with all its problems I don't think it's really a one star board. Changing lots of basic settings will cause the BIOS to hang or boot excruciatingly slow. An example is disabling the onboard sound. I had no desire to leave it enabled and load needless drivers, because I use a wireless headset or the speakers on my monitor via the DisplayPort link from the graphics card. So there was lots of 'change a settings, see if it reboots, if not clear the cmos, if so add it to the list of things I want to change that work so that when I hit the next odd one I can run down the list again'. Not difficult but very time consuming and painful. I believe this might also be why on Newegg there is a review where one said it was DOA and another said he thought it was DOA until he cleared the CMOS.<br /><br />Once I got it as close to the settings I wanted and it would still boot it was fine until we got to loading drivers. Here I will give them another star when they fix their support/download site. I built a PC without an optical drive, loading Windows from USB. To that end I didn't just insert the disc it came with to get the drivers I needed. Instead I went online to the web site and even tried the live update. The Intel Management Engine driver seems to be nowhere besides on the disk. After doing a Google search and figuring out what the device ID was I was able to locate the driver on the CD and copy it over. I also don't recall the IO Serial Drivers online, although I was able to get them via the Live Update application, which isbetter than having to resort to the ISO, but still a pain.<br /><br />Finally, one extra star when MSI Fast Boot is actually just that and not MSI Obnoxious Boot. To be able to access the BIOS more easily with Fast Boot enabled it appears they have a Fast Boot utility. And every time you boot up it's in the system tray, which is fine, but what it doesn't need to do is pop up and ask me if I still want to leave Fast Boot enabled or go to the BIOS on the next boot. I realize I can easily stop it from loading automatically on boot, but that is one epically obnoxious default behavior for an application that is supposed to make things faster."
2.0,Didn't like the picture quality of the cams..very basic cam..returned it within few days
2.0,"BIG PROBLEM...<br />This product works wonders with Motorola Moto X 2013, Lollipop , but with an mini Ipad(model A1432), I have serious problems causes is hang OS (IOS 8.4.1 ) , sticks and then the computer restarts (It makes me feel nostalgic formy old windows, hehe), I 've done it<br />reinstalled Sandisk software and...nothing , still has problems ... I can not think about this trouble..., the problem will be the wireless flash memory or is the ipad mini? I hope that It will be corrected with the new IOS update in this September?....or simply it is not compatible with MAC ??<br />Summarizing very disappointed.<br />waiting for help or comments<br />goodbye from Chile"
2.0,This boards outputs 3v and 3.8v not the 3.3v and 5.0v as advertised. I was pretty disappointed since I use a lot of 5v devices.
2.0,Crappy. This is regretful.
2.0,"Was a great monitor while it worked. However, after just over a month it died. Luckily, Amazon was kind enough to still give me a refund even though I was over the 30-day return policy."
2.0,"They were good for the month that they worked. Now, two of the three cables have become unreliable just 5 weeks after I purchased them.

2.0,why don't they tell you have to have a mirco sd card to download windows 10?
2.0,Came DOA. Not worth sending back since so cheap. Will not order again.
2.0,"**Update on 5/16/2016** After using this for about 7 months, I am lowering my rating. The one concern I had became a problem. The wire was not a large as my OEM charger, and after 7 months of use, the wires have broken inside the casing near the plug. I know they are broken because I can hold the plug at one particular angle and it will work. It is not the computer, as I have replicated the problem on two different laptops. I am lowering from 4 stars to 2. Not giving it 1 star because I suppose for the price, 7 months isn't bad. I do hate that we have to put up with &quot;disposable designs&quot;.<br /><br />**Original impression**Been using for 5 days now, and it seems to be working great. It has a 90 degree bend plug instead of straight like OEM, but that is ok because I can rotate it away from the DVD slot rather than having to hold the cord away to load a DVD. However, hang onto your original wall plug cord. The one that comes with this is a smaller gauge and shorter. That is my only reason for 4-star instead of 5. But that probably saves them a lot in manufacturing costs for copper wire and keeps the price down low for us."
2.0,"This ran very well for about 14 months, no problems with the computer concerning power and the noise lever, while higher than the original HP model, was fine. But at 14 months, it became VERY loud, for no discernible reason. It was so loud that sitting at the computer became almost intolerable and would even drown out the TV in the next room."
2.0,"This is a terrible laptop. I would not recommend that anyone buy it. The trackpad is a total joke. I get so frustrated that it hardly ever works. I now exclusively use a wired mouse with it in order to use laptop. It does have a fast start up, but that's probably because I am too scared to download anything to slow it down anymore once running. Seriously, for a supposed &#34;chromebook killer&#34; it starts to run slow and lag if I have more than 2 tabs open. And I know it's not the Internet because I have 16mb.<br /><br />Cons- needs a secondary mouse to function, slow, can't keep up with Internet websites, little internal hard drive space<br /><br />Pros- awesome blue color, very lightweight, fast start up, free Microsoft trial, 100GB of cloud storage"
2.0,"First I love the colors but Im extremely disappointed on it,  the more I tried to use it the more frustrating Im getting, I cant get a good grip on it and I keep hitting the right click button, Im right handed. The cord doesn't bother me, I just wish they made it more easy friendly. I am a gamer but I dont play pc games right now."
2.0,"Just too little - if I got it on, I couldn't open or close my computer, even though I do have a 15.6 computer. Liked the quality and color- hated that it did not fit."
2.0,"A very well built mouse no doubt.  I made the mistake of purchasing the white version though.  The material of the white version is a very slick material.  As soon as your hand gets any sort of lubrication on them, may it be from sweat or dirt, good luck holding on to this mouse.  The color variations and ability to change them is cool but that is as far as I would say is a real pro aspect of this mouse.  The mouse comes with no case to put any unused weights you don't use, and the sniper button, although placed very well on the mouse, it is not easy to maintain control of your weapon in game when pushing the sniper button.  I found myself never even using the sniper button anymore, because instead of fine tuning my aim to get on target I would end up being off target again because it is just so difficult to control the mouse when pressing the sniper button. The sniper button basically became the exact opposite for its purpose.  As for ergonomics, this mouse was not very comfortable for me.  If you have medium-large hands, I would not purchase this.  I have medium sized hands and it was so difficult to grip the mouse in a way where my fingers sat naturally and without strain.  There is no groove on this mouse to rest your ring finger on, and that was something I could not get over.  I would readjust my grip after 10-15 minutes, and then every 5 minutes once my hands began to sweat.  While I love Corsair and their products, this mouse was just one of those rare disappointments.  The reason why I did not 1 star this product is because due to its small size, it is more accommodating to gamers with smaller hands, and because the overall build of the product is quite well.  Oh, and the fact that it is an RGB mouse so you have 1.6 million colors to modify your mouse LEDs.  So bottom line is: small hands, I would recommend this; medium-large, I would not purchase this.  I would suggest the Razer Naga MMO mouse (even though its an MMO mouse, it is still a very capable mousefor FPS games. I play Battlefield 4 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with this mouse and I have a much better performance because the ergonomics of this mouse are more accommodating to my hand size).[[ASIN:B00E8CF268 Razer Naga MMO Gaming Mouse]]"
2.0,"Basic shell, and while it fit well, and might keep some basic scratches off the MacBook, does nothing to actually protect in a drop.  I had a 2 foot fall off a chair onto a corner, and the back end of the MacBook Pro was bent enough that the screen no longer closed properly and the port closest to the corner was unusable.  I was actually kind of surprised....I thought the aluminum body was supposed to be stronger than that.  Anyway, this case did nothing to help.  Luckily it was cheap enough that I don't care about throwing it in the trash."
2.0,Works great
2.0,"Worked inconsistently for 5 months, then stopped charging completely."
2.0,It worked well for a couple of months and then out of the blue just stopped charging. What can I really expect though.
2.0,Bluetooth is very inconsistent - many issues with apps freezing
2.0,"Case cracked around corners after a few weeks of use.  I have used a Zagg case for years with no problems.  This case is also very hard to use on a viewing angle because of the design, sorry not impressed at all."
2.0,"Pros:  Built in Battery, battery life - unknown<br />Cons:  Range is barely 7 ft.<br /><br />Device claims to work up to 30 ft.  I bought this for my wife's classroom so she could leave her computer connected to the projector and stand at the board to teach without walking back and forth all day to click links and bring students' attention to certain parts of her lessons.  Would have been perfect if the range is what it claimed."
2.0,"Nice item, but lasted only 3-4 months. Mine lasted about two months. It was also one of the most expensive."
2.0,Looks different in the web page.
2.0,"Worked good for a year, then crashed"
2.0,"These seem to be good power jacks, but they did not come with mounting nuts. Only way I see to use them is to drill a hole in a plastic case & screw them into it. Not sure I'll be able to find metric nuts to fit. The picture shows them coming with nuts."
2.0,"When I first received these cables I was impressed by the build quality and the beauty in the design, but after using them for a week I've realized they charge realllllllllllly slowly, like way slower than my lg cable that came with my lg g3. I wish I could love them, but :/ it takes like 5 hours to charge my phone with these cables. :C"
2.0,It is not the wright board for my computer
2.0,"This does NOT work with Kindle Fire!  So disgusted that I wasted my money.  Almost, I can use it on my Nexus.  Only reason it's getting two stars.  But I don't NEED it for that, that is not WHY I bought it."
2.0,one side failed within a year
2.0,"My expectation was that this unit was a viable replacement for the original HP charger, and the product description assured me that it was. Despite the assurance on the product description page as having '100% compatibility with the original' this charger only works when the Chromebook 11-1101 is not in use.  When I am using the unit and plug the charger in, an error message says that the charger is not compatible and it will not charge.  The additional claim that 'This product has been tested and validated to ensure it will work with.. Chromebook 11-1101...' is misleading.  Yes, the charger works- but only if you never need to charge while you are using the Chromebook!  My expectations were not met."
2.0,"Liked the item but what a shame that it was shipped to me broken,  did not bother to return it because in total it is costing me more than what it's worth"
2.0,"I purchased this product to put in an upstairs room where I could only get one, unreliable, bar of WiFi on my phone or tablet and we have little  cell phone coverage where I live (well more like none). I read many reviews on several products like this one and chose this product because of how easy it was supposed to be to install (supposedly &#34;plug & play&#34; basically).  I had to return the product because I could never get it to connect to the wireless router let alone place in another area to try and extend the router's range. I gave it two stars because I'm sure there's a possibility it could have been &#34;user error&#34; on my part but I tried everything in the instructions (including plugging it directly in with the ethernet cord provided) several times and even had a couple of tech savvy people try to help me with no luck. It may work for others but it's certainly not as simple as they make it sound."
2.0,"It was very easy to set up, though the instructions could use some grammar fixes.  I do have quite a few problems with it keeping the connection to the main router.  I have to constantly unplug and re-plug it in to sometimes get it to work again.  Most of the time it says I have internet when I'm connected to it, but I don't.  When it is working, it works great, but it's spotty at best.  Even as I type this I have to change to the main router, for which I only have 1 bar of signal, which is why I bought this in the first place.  The other problem I'm having with it is once it is set up with the SSID and password, I can no longer access the GUID to change any settings.  The only way I can is to do a factory reset and do everything over again.  I've done this 3 times now just to see if there's a setting I'm missing so it will keep a connection to the main router.  Nothing seems to work.  I will try swapping it out with a new one and will update when I receive the replacement."
2.0,Colors are faded..but it a good case. Had it for a month and now its cracking..soild plastic..
2.0,"Personally I really didn't like this case for it's style, quality and price. Nothing is wrong with it for protecting your device. I personally didn't like it"
2.0,"This product does the job. Unfortunately one of the two RAM slots does not work. Hopefully the rest of the components remain durable. Everything else seems to work well. Now that I have built this computer, put everything in place, screwed everything in and have things working the way I want to (aside from only having 8 GB RAM instead of 16 GB), I'd rather not return it; I might as well leave it in and save the motherboard for another computer to build. Also, beware there is no USB 3.0 20 pin connector on board to plug in any usb 3.0 slots from the front of a case, but it does have two usb 2.0 connectors on the board. I do wish I spent the extra $20-30 for a better board.<br />My Budget build:<br />- AMD X4 860k Quad Core 3.7 GHz Black edition (Definitely worth the money, but if you can afford it go for a quad core i5)<br />- PNY Nvidia Geforce gtx 750 ti (highly recommend it, especially if you can find it for under $100)<br />- 1 TB WD blue HDD<br />- Corsair Carbide 200 R case<br />- The $40 EVGA PSU<br />- 16 GB (4 x 2) Kingston HyperX Fury at 1866 MHz<br />- Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (Awesome, but massive, so make sure your case is wide enough for it; the 200 R case has less than an inch between the left panel and the cooler)"
2.0,"Disappointing! Have had the Kindle Fire for about a year. At first it worked fine. Then in the past month, haven't been able to download library books through Amazon's manage your device and content and sign in pages. The content does not show up on the carousel as it had been doing. Finally, I had to click on &#34;read in browser&#34; which makes it kind of difficult to enjoy reading as there is the continual browser heading above. Will not be purchasing anymore Kindle Fire HD tablets."
2.0,"paid for this additional protection; however, it was not needed."
2.0,"I bought this product for my business about a month now and it worked really well.  I went ahead and bought a second one for a family member's home. They barely had it a few days and it wasn't working.  We called customer services for troubleshoot help and they said it's a defective router.  They told us that we can mail it to them to get it fixed (we pay shipping) and then it will take them about 4 weeks to return the router to us (we pay shipping).  All this after we've spent over an hour on the phone with their tech support.  As for my first one, I'm happy with it, but for the second one, customer service could be better."
2.0,"The bluetooth keyboard itself is fantastic. Very responsive and ridiculous battery life. The case itself is junk. Putting my Galaxy Tab 4 in the very first time and I heard some snaps and crackles. I came to find the thin plastic cutout for the power button had cracked. After light use with opening and closing the case, some more cracks at the hinge. Now I'm gunshy about opening the case for fear of the hinge completely breaking and my tablet falling to the ground."
2.0,"The material is average and finishing is not too impressive. Also there is no need of screen for Fire as it has gorilla glass, but not sure why this is being sold with it...<br /><br />Rgds,<br />MD"
2.0,Bought it in July and just passed my return date it has been giving me problems. Various issues are the pointer will drag to the bottom by itself. Second is having to click on mouse several times before it recognizes you pressed it. It's a pretty expensive mouse to be giving me these problems.
2.0,"Is it me? or is Windows 8 the worst OS ever?  The ASUS keyboard is unresponsive (especially the space key, which I often have to hit 2 or 3 times), but the mouse pad is way OVER sensitive just moving your hand over it can make the screen go random on you.  I can't imagine a time when the &#34;tablet&#34; functionality would actually be of any use to me, and the fact that when folded back on its self the keyboard becomes the bottom of the tablet (tho inactivated) leaving all those delicate keys etc where they are most likely to get damaged.<br /><br />It is also DOG SLOW.  Click on windows explorer to check the contents of a directory AND BE PREPARED TO WAIT several seconds for the screen to populate.  With XP the explorer was always instantaneous (at least for any local drives)."
2.0,It worked very well for the first few months but after the left mouse button would occasionally double click. I made sure not to press the double click button but often when I pushed the button down it would click and when I released the button it would click again. This made it very frustrating to browse and game. I eventually went back to my older mouse that worked fine.
2.0,meh
2.0,"The case has a fine plastic fabric-like rough surface which causes me pain to hold it in my hand.  It's difficult to describe - like chalk scratching on a chalkboard, but for touch rather than sound.  From reading other reviews, I appear to be alone in my assessment.  I had to return it."
2.0,key board works perfect I really loved it but the case has really weak corners and it cracked in a week.
2.0,"I've had the iBenzer case for about two months, ever since I bought my Macbook. In that two months the case is cracked and shattered in multiple places and has chipped in several places as well. Not high quality at all and probably won't last for another month through college."
2.0,"I would have given this 1 1/2 stars if possible.  My feelings are definitely between &#34;I hate it&#34; and &#34;I don't like it&#34;.  My 10 year old was asking for a tablet, and we decided to let her purchase one with her own money.  That being said, I never assumed this would be comparable to a Kindle or an IPad.  However, calling it sub-par, is an understatement.  There is little memory, but ok, I bought a sd card.  The camera quality is horrible, like extremely grainy.  She wanted to be able to take photos & get creative with adding words, finishes, etc. as she is &#34;artsy&#34;.  THat isn't happening.  The battery life is horrible.  We downloaded 2 games.  I monitor the use of the tablet, and if the apps are running.  This tablet is almost always in need of a charge.  If the battery ever gets below 30%, it takes HOURS to charge, literally HOURS.  Like 4 - 5 hours.  I have a disappointed kid and a tablet that is basically useless.  Should have spent the extra $100 to get a kindle."
2.0,The cover fits well but the case arrived with a dent on the cover.
2.0,Wow this is old school remedy. I had a wart on my elbow for the longest. Grew maybe .25 of n inch. I plastered it on. Sometimes grueling... Gotta man up. 75% is gone. I'm scared too put more on at this point for the other 25%. I believe it's still working it's way
2.0,"Was not impressed at all with this keyboard. Yes it is cheap and you get what you pay for, but for $5 more you can get this! (Which I did shortly after recieving the blue finger) The bluefinger is thin and flimsy plastic, would not recommend it.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNQG0N4/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_qbY3vbHJ8YP9F"
2.0,When searching for a HDMI cable  this came up 1st<br />This is a USB cable not what i thought it was so my bad but when searching for a HDMI i would think thats what would come up<br />My mistake but not happy
2.0,"I purchased this product for my Janome sewing machine. Unfortunately, it is not compatible and I never got to see if it worked.  So if you are going to get this for a sewing machine keep in mind that storage is not everything and machines that require a CF probably have incredibly slow processors and the 16 GB will freeze your machine. Try something like 32 MB."
2.0,Bought 2 of these and one cracked inside my NEW mobile phone. Very dicey removal.
2.0,"Received my order, shipped from China, but found the chargers are not the OEM Original Equipment I have used since 2011.  As background, I own 8 actual, original chargers purchased from BlackBerry; some are wearing out so I wanted to replace those units.  Upon removing one unit from it's thin plastic bag, I immediately noticed the weight was off - it was lighter than my other chargers.  I then checked the plug blades - unlike the originals, they don't 'snap' into open position, rather the prongs are flimsy and do not stay in the fully opened position.  The USB cable is not covered in the same rubberized material, instead a more shiny, plastic sheathing is used and the overall length was off by approximately 6 inches (shorter).  Also, the plug end was not as finely made and used a different metallic connector, though it did fit into a device charging port just fine.  I've been testing on on a brand new device, and the charging rate is not what I would expect from a 1.8amp 5 volt charger - a standard, 1.0 amp charging plug is beating it to 100% charged, handily.  The wall-wart also became much hotter than the original models I own.  I will not be using these units to charge my devices."
2.0,Its pretty but way smaller than in the photo
2.0,"The dragon is slow, and your always charging the darn thing."
2.0,"The nexus doesn't really fit in it very well - it is really crammed in there. The corners have velcro on the back so they are adjustable and they are all slightly outside the &#34;frame&#34; of fabric. The nexus is a little too wide and is bending them out, too. It also isn't easy to zip up, one of our kids broke off one of the gigantic zipper pulls already - less than a week after we got it. It would be a better fitting case for anything smaller than the Nexus 7, I have no idea why they are selling it that way. It does seem like it would protect the tablet if it was zipped up and so far it hasn't popped a corner so I don't &#34;hate&#34; it, it just isn't something I would recommend or buy again."
2.0,"The Good: Small package, light, relatively sturdy, connected at 100Mb/s without issue.<br />The Bad: Not Gigabit capable, as only 4 pins are connected. This is NOT 10/100/1000 capable.<br />While I still have some use for them, I bought these over the cheaper options specifically for that functionality. As a network engineer - I need all 8 pins connected for console cable extension, and some of the higher-end devices are only capable of running at 1Gb or higher. If you have remotely similar desires - look elsewhere."
2.0,"Arrived late, but the real problem is that they don't work on my iPad Air.  They seem to work fine on the iPhone 6's, but not the iPad.  I tried the original block, and 2 others."
2.0,"I liked the look, but clasp broke about the second time I got in a car. Never heard back from seller about replacement."
2.0,Stopped working after 14 months I guess I should have gotten the extended warranty
2.0,"Had to return, is NOT a wifi tablet but US Cellular unit and there is no US Cellular in our area, Had difficulties in getting wifi to work properly."
2.0,"Had to return to Amazon for a refund.  It could be a design deficiency or just a bad case cover that I got.  Anyway, when the cover was opened and folded to the back, the cover magnet put the Kindle to sleep while reading.  Hmmm.  Just like when you closed the cover.  Could not use unless I held the cover open which was cumbersome.  So, I returned it for a refund to order a different cover."
2.0,I need to constantly unplug and plug it back in for it to work :-(
2.0,Does not hold my iPad in constantly falling out
2.0,The openings do not line up with the iPad so the camera lens is partially covered with the plastic cover and the volume buttons are partially covered and sometimes just start to adjust if slightly touched. The actual fit is fine and the quality seems fine too so far but the biggest downfall is the alignment of the openings on the case vs the iPad.
2.0,Wasted hours trying to get this to work properly.  Couldn't get any laptop or phone in my house to work right with it.
2.0,While the cables look nice they all gradually deteriorate over the course of a few months. I'm on my last one now. Quality not great so I'd suggest investing elsewhere unless you just want a cheap stopgap.
2.0,"I like the protection part of the case, but it doesn't work very well as a stand.  Also not very easy to keep clean."
2.0,"Don't get me wrong it's a great bag, lots of space. But the material isn't very strong, or maybe my laptop is too heavy, but the bag was ripped on one side after a week of use."
2.0,"It works as a mouse, but not a very good one:  the laser doesn't track motion well, the side buttons squeak when you click them, and you often have to click on a link more than once.to get it to work.  Microsoft didn't do well on this product."
2.0,This tablet has very little storage. My grandson becomes frustrated and doesn't want to play with it because it moves so slowly. All in all it's worth the inexpensive price.
2.0,If you use the 3D you don't want these in the matte styling. It causes more ghosting and general blurriness
2.0,As soon as the kickstand is opened it never really settles back into place and flopping out. Also it broke really easily. Its nice but i'd recommend something else
2.0,The battery life is the worst.  It doesn't last more then a couple hours if that.  Not impressed by it.  I regret purchasing it.
2.0,"Absolutely wonderful case. It's very slim and fits my Macbook Air 11 inch perfectly. I've used it for about 2 months now and it has held up extremely well! I'm extremely pleased and would definitely recommend it!!<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />After using this case for about 4 months now, the little plastic grips on the bottom of the case that prevent your laptop from sliding around when it is set on a table have completely fallen off. This case is pretty much worthless, now. I'll have to spend more money to buy a new one. If I could, I would contact the company, but I have no idea how- thanks a lot, Amazon! I really wouldn't even recommend this case anymore. After less than 6 months, it's broken and ruined."
2.0,Piece of junk lost its &#34;waterproof&#34; coat after less then a month. The drive holds memory but the both the rubber & plastic cases have broken off. We're lucky it still plugs into a USB at least.
2.0,Does not work. I plugged this into my pair of Steel Series Siberia v2's and I was still not able to use the built in microphone.
2.0,"Soso case, bit overpriced and not really slim. Feels cheap."
2.0,Does not seem to lie flat. Always curls up on edges.
2.0,Its good but keeps freezing when I'm on it for longer then an hour.
2.0,It didn't hold the table in place
2.0,"Bought this and Google Play services is broke.  Google Play Store, Calendar, Hangouts does not work.  Oddly, other Google apps like Gmail, Google Drive work but you can't update apps without Google Play Store.  System Updates stuck at &#60;insert date here&#62;, 1969.  Performed factory resets, re-adding accounts, clearing cache, etc.  Nothing worked.  Probably a bad tablet and will end up returning it.  Assuming it worked, it might still be worth the price paid as long as you can get a working unit."
2.0,"This was purchased as a replacement for my 3 yo Kindle.<br /><br />I have to admit, I am very disappointed.  The charge seems to last about half as long, the touch screen alternates between not responding at all and responding hysterically by pulling up random menu items or paging backward and forward at will, setting up my library was very annoying and took about 3x as long as my last one to set up and for some reason, I had to go back and download some of my items multiple times because they didn't stay in memory.<br /><br />It is very awkward to use unless I am sitting and holding it in my right hand.  It's almost more trouble than it's worth.  I would think I just got a &#34;lemon&#34;, but I bought one for my son and my mom at the same time and neither of them like their new Kindle either.  I wonder if it's a ploy to get me to upgrade to a Paperwhite or Voyage?"
2.0,They try to copy Mac - it did not work out. No docking system option - are you kidding?
2.0,Seemed like a great buy for the price I paid but not very functional for my need. The &#34;hook&#34; side is fine but the &#34;loop&#34; side does not have enough material to latch on securely. Might work ok for light objects like pens or name tags but I would not trust for valuable items or for professional use. I wanted to use it to strap a mini tripod with a camera to poles and such but definitely not strong enough for that.
2.0,Too small
2.0,"I was expecting SOME link to SOME software, however,  you get a black box with a cable.  No documentation, no web link.  Useless without any type of guidance to a complete system."
2.0,Ok product. Tore up quickly
2.0,Works for my phone will not conect with the laptop is bought it for
2.0,"This is clearly &#34;side&#34; lit technology, and not per-pixel back lighting, so I feel very misled.  Clearly grainy display compared to most LED monitors I've seen because of this, and isn't as bright as it should be.  Additionally, with anything at all that moves, you get a clear trailing ghost, showing that the advertised response time is not what the spec might make you believe.  Not good at all for any FPS in my opinion.  Made me dizzy.<br />It is certainly stunning simply due to it's enormous display, and works well overall, but I was disappointed and felt very misled by the specs.<br />If you're just running business apps.. it's great."
2.0,Sound system not that great as described.  Screen images average.  I like my 11 inch dell venue tablet better
2.0,"I read somewhere that the Kindle ran on the Android OS.  So I bought it during the Prime Day sale.  They actually use a customized version of Android OS, which they call Fire, and will not get you most of the cool apps that a regular android tablet will get you.  Basically this was a waste of money for me and I am glad I paid the Prime Day price, which was the most disappointing sale ever!!"
2.0,"The headset is nice, but as others on here have mentioned - the ear piece snaps after about a year of use. Now, the right ear piece dangles off the side of my head, rendering the headset un-usable."
2.0,"Not what I expected. Very disappointed with performance.  The refurbished HP EliteBook is like my old grandmother, slow & dithery. Very slow response & difficulty with multitasking demands.  Keyboard issues also give this model an overall poor rating  [[ASIN:B00XLZWN8S HP EliteBook 8460P 14-inch Notebook PC - Intel Core i5-2520M 2.5GHz 4GB 250GB Windows 7 Pro (Certified Refurbished)]]"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:4653513f9a73d56338bbdf28f1d90a4]] The video illustrates the main issue with the one surviving Green Hard Drive. I don't know why this drive has such good ratings. I bought two of them a while back and used them only as mirror drives (only ever plug them in to put files on them and then put them away). In my estimation these drives were built to occupy a landfill somewhere. One of them completely died pretty soon after purchase and the other is so slow that I grow significantly older each time I use it. I was promised that the drives run between 5400 & 7200 RPMs but I'd say during a simple file transfer they run at about 500 RPMs. The one that's still active takes forever to appear on the desk top and it even takes a while to empty the trash. I have always felt like this drive was trying to hit rock bottom, which I admire in a human, but not a machine. The only reason it get's two stars is because it actually functions. Since you cannot give a rating of \\""no stars\\"", you have to save 1 star for things that don't work at all (in my humble and correct opinion)."
2.0,"Keyboard works fine, the but there is no lightning cable pass through to connect other devices, especially a charger while the keyboard is connected.  As there appears to be no such thing as a lightning hub or splitter, I'm stuck swapping this Macally keyboard out with power or computer connections.<br /><br />Move on and pick a keyboard that supports lightning cable passthrough."
2.0,"Super flimsy, but haven't tried it yet."
2.0,Am returning as soon as I figure out how to print return labels from my tablet.
2.0,"Bought 2 sets and after only 2 weeks, 4 of the cables are already no good."
2.0,It came with too many apps and it was extremely slow..after three weeks the screen went blank and kept saying it was trying to fix itself
2.0,"Worked for about 2-3 charges then stopped, and one even came apart without with exposed wires.  Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,"The length was great, but it stopped working after a month or so.  The phone would keep buzzing like when you first plug it in to charge."
2.0,Caps lock key doesn't work.
2.0,I like the device but the app that goes with it has issues (Android) it will not read/write to the external SD card that is in your phone or tablet. My guess it's a port from iOS so doesn't even know that such a thing exist. If you have a device with an external SD card forget it you'll have to use a 3rd party app to transfer files to or from your SC card.
2.0,It will not scroll up or down
2.0,"The quality material i thought it will be better, also the level of charging indicator on the battery back is no fitting to the light coming out from it i think it is bad quality finishing and lastly when the battery charge was 76 % my laptop did not continue more than half an hour using it after that the battery was 0"
2.0,"This battery worked, but I had trouble getting it to stay attached to the clip (didn't seem to fit right) and the star screwdriver that came with it didn't fit.  Luckily I had a small phillips screwdriver that worked.  You may want to try another brand.  There are a couple of good videos on youtube showing how to take your Nook HD apart.  I highly recommend you review them before tackling this.  Keep the piece of tape from the old battery for reuse.  Using a guitar pick (sliding it around the cover) to separate the top works well."
2.0,ITS OK I DONT USE IT I BOUGHT IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE IN MY OFFICE
2.0,"The zipper is super faulty. The bag is very cute & the perfect size, but my zipper broke after 7 uses."
2.0,"Only works for very, very old SIM cards (pre 2000) that have not been updated -- if there are still any of those SIMs around!"
2.0,Will not go faster than 85mbs and I have a 150mbs line
2.0,"I wanted to love it, 2700 reviews can't be wrong, right? Well, I put the brand new Ipad in the case and tried to test it standing up on the kitchen counter. The Ipad went &#34;flop&#34; in a second. I ordered two cases(have 2 Ipads at home) so tried testing the other one and &#34;flop&#34; again. The stand with the handle is just not wide enough for support the weight of the Ipad. Plus the recline is not good enough, would be very hard to watch anything on the Ipad that practically stands up 90 degrees. Maybe it is good for those who never need to use the stand. Well, in that case I would recommend thicker rubber cases and no stand, but offer a lot more protection."
2.0,"Looks great and high quality but the truth is &#34;Fit the Surface Pro 3 NOT WELL&#34; While you put Surface inside, push (hardly) to the end and  it still 3~5 mm left out the left-hand side because of thickness if the right-hand side leather. I'm really afraid that if something knock the corner, the case cannot provide enough protection!!"
2.0,"Bad design. The power port is not thought out and brakes off from the mother board just after 2 weeks of use. Acer support wants you to ship it in for 6 weeks turn around. No loaner laptop offered. Amazon is great, we returned this defective thing and purchased a Yoga 3."
2.0,"Disappointed, quit working after a short period of time. Started out with good sound quality but then just quit. Glad I had the insurance<br />I was refunded my purchase price."
2.0,"Range is terrible. I have this keyboard less than 10 feet from the receiver, which is plugged into the front of the PC, on a wooden coffee table. But the pointer lags and rubber bands unless I pick up the keyboard so the coffee table isn't in the way anymore. Once I do that, the performance is adequate for most purposes, but I wouldn't play a game with it."
2.0,"Cable seems sturdy enough, and much sturdier than similar cables for the same price. However, after only a few weeks' use, the connection is now loose and has to be held in the phone just right in order to charge it. It worked well at first. This has been the same with 3 AmazonBasics USB cables that I have bought now.<br /><br />If these weren't sturdier cables, this would be a 1 star review. DON'T BUY."
2.0,The touchscreen went out 4 months after warranty expired. $195.00 to replaced.
2.0,"Sometimes it doesn't work at all, just static (remember the old TVs?). When it worked, I could never get the picture to fit on the screen. I tried multiple resolutions and nothing helped."
2.0,"Decent, but forgets configuration after power loss."
2.0,No pass through for charging while keyboard is connected.
2.0,love the set just didn't ask for two of them!
2.0,"I pre-ordered this item from Matias's website not from this seller, so my review goes entirely to the product itself.<br /><br />I like the general idea of being both ergo and mechanical. This keeps my wrists much more comfortable. I will be more than happy to see more such products coming up.<br /><br />However, this quality of this product is below the average of mechanical keyboards:<br />1. the switches are not as comfortable as Cherry's. It's quieter, but doesn't give your fingers enough rebounce.<br />2. more seriously, some hardware bugs make keys repeat themselves sometimes. For example, for my keyboard, pressing the &#34;c&#34; key once results in two &#34;c&#34;s on the screen. This happens roughly 1 out of 20 strokes! This is really intolerable. Also, some keys occasionally repeat itself until you press another key. This happens less often than the issue with &#34;c&#34;, but still very annoying. The end result is that my typing speed is reduced because I have to frequently go back to change what my keyboard has messed up."
2.0,"I actually like the way the mouse feels in the hand -- it's light and tracks nicely, and is a good replacement for those who like the feel of the Microsoft Intellimouse Optical (the Kana is a little smaller than the Intellimouse, the Sensei a little larger).  My only complaint about the hardware is that the L and R buttons take a bit too much force to click (I like a very light force).  Supposedly this is corrected in the Kana V2, which uses a different brand of switch.<br /><br />So why two stars?  I did so to call attention to SteelSeries' striking misrepresentation of the functionality of their software. Before purchasing it, I checked SteelSeries.com to make sure the software would work with OS X Yosemite (10.10).  According to the website, the Kana requires Engine 2 (they've not yet gotten Engine 3 to work with it), but the website assured me that Engine 2 works with &#34;Mac OSX 10.7 or newer.&#34;  Unfortunately, after purchasing the Kana I found that Engine 2 could not recognize the mouse.  After some email back-and-forth with Brendan M at SteelSeries technical support, I finally got this piece of information in an email on August 26, 2015:<br /><br />&#34;Unfortunately none of our SteelSeries Engine 2.0 software or drivers are compatible with OS X 10.9+ yet.We are working diligently to release be ready for the release of the retail client. We are working around the clock to get these updates out to our customers as fast as we can to minimize the downtime our customers are experiencing. As soon as the software and drivers become available they will be posted immediately to our website in the download section.Thanks for your patience and understanding.Regards,<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Brendan M<br />SteelSeries Support&#34;<br /><br />Now this is all very polite and apologetic, but the fact remains that, even after he sent this email -- clearly indicating that SteelSeries knew that the software didn't work with Yosemite, the website continued to claim itdid (see attached screenshot, taken August 26, 2015).<br /><br />The bottom line is that they're not being truthful, and as a result wasted a lot of my time.  I returned the Kana."
2.0,Was a great case until I took my tablet out of the case and noticed the the color from the case stained the back of my white tablet. Not happy at all about this.
2.0,Very flimsy. Mic broke after a month. Not very well made
2.0,"I did not realize these are old versions, they did not work and bought a pair of new Dongles locally that were up to date"
2.0,This product didn't work for me and was returned.
2.0,"Modem works fine but it does not support 300 down.  Stars are reflective of description claims.  If you don't have TWC Maxx in your area, this is a good modem.<br /><br />Maybe in some theoretical world but with TWC Maxx, extreme, I see 118 down and 11 up.  Was told I had to upgrade to the SB6183 version to get the 200 or 300 down speeds.  Must have 16 channels."
2.0,"I've had these cables a couple weeks now and you have to place them perfectly and DO NOT bump them or they stop working. For the price I wasn't expecting rocket speeds or anything, but I did expect them to work."
2.0,Well it's keeping my computer on BUT not charging my laptop and yes it'a the correct one for my laptop.
2.0,"*EDIT* I recently installed Windows 10 on my XPS 13 (2015 edition), and now I can no longer use the Dell Universal Adapter. I consistently get a &#34;Code 43, Device Descriptor Request Failed&#34; despite having up to date drivers installed. I have followed every suggestion I could find on Google for how to fix this issue, but no dice. The only reason I'm keeping the review at 2 stars is the device was wonderful when it actually worked. I would not count on this product working with Windows 10 until an update gets released.  This is a perfect compliment to my 2015 Dell XPS 13. I am a graduate teaching assistant, so I consistently present powerpoints to faculty, in addition to teaching undergraduate lectures. My university is a mess of modern and ancient classrooms, so having a small device that is compatible with HDMI, VGA, and ethernet is essential when I don't know which classroom situation I'll be faced with. My only complaint is that the USB port on the adapter is USB 2.0 instead of 3.0. I understand they probably had to make it 2.0 to balance power consumption from all of the ports, but as I only have 2 USB ports on my laptop, it would be nice to maintain 2 functional USB 3.0 ports when the adapter is plugged in instead of being reduced to one. Overall though, this is a great device for graduate students constantly on the move!"
2.0,"Great that u can play games and have multiple users, but u can't watch YouTube, and the ram is low.  Although the octo-core processor pops out at u it doesn't seem as fast as u would think."
2.0,"The case fits the tab 2 10.1 perfectly, and the keyboard has great feel and connects easily.  The way the tablet stands when in typing position is not the best.  There really is nothing to keep it in place, so the tablet can fall down if you don't let the bottom rest right against the numbers on the keyboard.  But, that is not really that big a deal.  It still stands and you can see and type.  The shortcut buttons work.  You do have to close the on screen keyboard manually after touching a field to type in, but that isn't a huge deal.<br /><br />The main reason for the bad review is that while the keyboard was connected it interfered with my wifi connection.  As soon as I connected the keyboard and started using it, I couldn't view any online sites because my connection would keep cutting out and reconnecting.  As soon as I turned off the keyboard, my internet was back to normal.  I thought it might be the bluetooth in general on the tablet; so I tested with another bluetooth keyboard, and I had no problem being connected to wifi and the keyboard at the same time.  I used them together for about 30 min to make sure, and still no problems.  I connected a set of bluetooth headphones, and no problems there either.<br /><br />I wanted to give the case another shot, so I restarted the tablet and reconnected this case's keyboard, and I immediately lost my wifi connection.<br /><br />I didn't see anyone else with this issue in the reviews, so this may have just been a defective keyboard. I will keep looking for a keyboard that works well with this tablet since it really does increase the functionality of the tablet tremendously."
2.0,Stopped working after only a couple of months. Worked good while it was working.
2.0,Short life on the cable. It is already coming apart at the connection
2.0,It would of been perfect if it held the ipad tightly. It gets loose a minute after you put it in. Just slides out of it. Great Idea if they could fixed the grip.
2.0,"It is likely that I don't quite know how to use some of the features and functions of the WinBook TW802.  But I am not satisfied, and would not recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />1.  The touch pad surface is very insensitive.  With Win 8.1, i could rarely get the normal touch screen functions to work.  So I bought a separate stylus, the best I could find, but the touchpad still remains very insensitive.  So, I bought a BlueTooth mouse.<br />2.  When the Bluetooth connectivity works, the mouse makes a huge difference.  The accurate point and click of the mouse removed the problems I had with the touchpad.  However, Bluetooth connections are very unstable.  I have to go through a repeated process of forgetting and reconnecting both the mouse and the provided keyboard.  Thinking this problem might be the keyboard and mouse, I paired both with my Samsung Android pad, and both work flawlessly.  I have to conclude that it is the WinBook TW802 which has a weak or unstable Bluetooth operation.  So, the Bluetooth will be dedicated to my Samsung pad.<br />3.  To ovecome this problem wih Bluetooth, I hoped to get better touch pad function with Windows 10, and so upgraded.  Win 10 seems to run quite well, actually seems somewhat faster than Win 8.1.  However, the touch pad surface of the TW802 is still insensitive, and I really still have to use a mouse.<br />4.  To overcome the Bluetooth problems, I purchased a Logitech keyboard and mouse combination, and connected that to the standard USB port.  This actually worked well, except I had to carry a rather large keyboard with a tiny computer, which rather defeats the point of a small Windows tablet.<br />5.  Following the installation of Win 10, I see that now the available SSD storage is almost entirely flled up with the OS.  So now I get the space warnings for my C; drive.  And of course, Win 10 won't yet allow me to move applications to the 32 MB SD storage.<br />So, I am kind of stuck.  I guess I wil just set this aside as a bad decision.  That being said, I got a great deal on a very compact  Lonovo notebook, so I might never need to go back to the TW802, and I can just send this to a museum.<br />RE Jacobs"
2.0,Doesn't seem to want to extend the WiFi channel I need extended. Will have to work on it.
2.0,"This was a good cable, until it broke in the first 2 months.  The iXCC Charger I got is still working great and I love it but the cable didn't last like I had hoped."
2.0,"Note that it is not 1 foot of wiring for each branch of the 'Y' but one total foot at the longest points. I can't even connect to my 2 monitors because they are more than 12&#34; apart.<br /><br />If you are like me, trying to connect a laptop/tower to 2 monitors, this will not be sufficient. To be honest I don't know what purpose this could possibly serve with this short of a connection."
2.0,Not too happy with it.  The cameras don't work very well. It seems to be slow on loading content.<br />But my worst problem is that you have to tap it very hard to make it work and very often you must tap it several times to get it to work at all.<br /> It is pretty heavy even compared to my HDX 7.  the battery doesn't hold the charge as long as claimed. I love my other Kindles but maybe not this one.  I bought it for the 2 camera feature but that doesn't work very well. It's blurry.
2.0,terrible
2.0,"Not really worth the money. I honestly only liked 3 out of the 100 stickers (original Apple logo, Vans logo, and old school MTV logo) that were shipped to me. They are all quite small, probably an average of 2x2 - 3x3 inches. A bunch (35%) of random and useless stickers, such as the logos for Best Buy, Pizza Hut, Shell Gas Station, McDonalds, Dickies, H&M, Android, Pepsi and so many more logos that literally serve me no purpose whatsoever. 60% of the stickers are random anime cartoons that, quite honestly, I cannot even identify. Not to mention one of Santa holding a martini ??? Not quite sure what happened, but I definitely feel much stupider and penniless after looking through these stickers."
2.0,"First and foremost, ignore the crossed out $199 price tag that Amazon is for some reason letting these crooks display on their website.  This tablet has never and will never be a $200 quality tablet.  You basically get what you pay for here, which is a $60 tablet that functions like you would expect from a $60 tablet...  And that's not good.  Especially when these are clearly advertised for you to buy for your child.  If your child is under the age of say 3, this might be an appropriate first tablet.  Children older than 3, or ones smart enough to know a piece of junk when they see it, will likely just hate you for being so cheap.  The battery life is abysmal.  If your child gets 2-3 hours of play before it dies, they will be lucky.  Similarly, the amount of time the battery takes to charge just as terrible, if not worse.  It has virtually no storage space, so you'll spend most of your time trying to convince your child that they have to erase games they have no interest in erasing.  And chances are once you get something new installed, it's going to run so slow that it's virtually unplayable.  The only reason I gave it a second star is because it hasn't entirely died as of yet, and because miraculously it's reasonably sturdy when it comes to being dropped/abused in ways that most young children handle their toys.  So again, you're basically getting exactly what you pay for.  A cheap tablet at a cheap price.  If you are generally trying to buy something for a child you actually care about, spend another $40 and get them a legitimate tablet.  These people posting 4/5 star reviews must really dislike their kids."
2.0,"These appear to be well constructed and at first appear to fit well with my phone (Samsung S6).  Over a week however, the micro USB connection to my phone became loose and did not fit tightly with the connection easily detaching.  I cannot hold the phone in my hand when charging because the USB will detach from my phone.  Furthermore, because of the loose fit, I am applying a lot of force to make it connect to my phone and in the process likely damaging my phone's USB input.  I would stay away."
2.0,"I don´t know why, but they they both work fine individually.<br />I put them in dual channel in 2 laptops, but both crashed after windows explorer bootin was finished. Also got some visual display issues and some blue screens.<br /><br />Both laptops admit these specs, but the kit never worked in dual channel."
2.0,"The case itself is fairly nice in terms of color and texture(very smooth) However, after 3 months you can expect some of the rubber bumpers on the bottom half to fall off especially if you carry your mac around all day or move it around a lot."
2.0,"Edited 9/9/15 Pros: Good battery- got upwards of 6-7 hours or more no problem. Well built - feels like a quality product. The hinge was tough and sturdy.  Clear screen - for its resolution, I didn't see any pixelation. Just right.   Cons: Touchscreen barely worked - would inconsistently register touches and had a difficult time registering the corners.  Awkward to hold in tablet mode - this is something I felt and is purely opinion.  Not a micro USB charger - the Asus T100TA has it, why not this?"
2.0,These lack the button terminal common to other 14430 size batteries.
2.0,Returned. Thought it was a tv.
2.0,"Resisting the charges required for iCloud use to simply backup my OWN data, I wanted a secure storage device instead.  This does claim to provide AES 256 encryption, but they don't say how this works and I can't find an online manual from their &#34;thin&#34; website.  The manual that comes with the app is also thin.  I gave the drive a password on my iPad, but then when I move the drive to my PC, it let me access it without a password?  This product does seems to &#34;work&#34; as expected, but you must download their app on every device you use it on.  That's pretty simple to do, but the app is pretty thin on info and is not intuitive.  I did copy a mess of PDF files (manuals for an RV road trip).  They were readable on my iPad.  There is one flaw in their engineering, that could have been easily fixed with better field tests and a small redesign.  The small apple plug that goes into your iPad and iPhone is only the length of the port itself.  Therefore you must remove any covers from your iPad/iPhone that restrict the distance to the port.  The Thumbdrive will ONLY work if it's plugged securely in and that means you must have the bare/exposed port area clear of anything, including covers.  Had they simply made the shaft of the Apple port about a 1/4&#34; longer, it would just work with covers in place, especially since the entire port retracts on some shaft to protect it?  This is a major pain for those who use covers (like 98% of all owners?).  For that matter, the USB plug could use some extra extension as well.  They need to test these things on devices outside their lab.  Perhaps O'pro9 will remedy that in future models.  It's not enough to give it a &#34;fail&#34; but it's VERY disappointing since I've seen this repeatedly with other products and no one seems to be learning about that weakness."
2.0,"The hard shell was great, but I did not receive the free keyboard cover. The free keyboard cover was the reason that I purchased the case. :-( Delivery time was fast."
2.0,"Very disappointing product.  Portrait mode support expects the physical orientation of the screen to remain horizontal and instead creates a screen image vertically in landscape mode with black side bars.  Eliminates my two main use cases, sheet music display and enlarged reading of technical books.  Really feels like I waste my money.<br /><br />Touch screen performance also seems to be twitchy, seems to be confused if a hand is touching on the border, for example if the tablet is being held on lap and using a hand to stabile and it is overlaps the bezel.  Once I figured it out, I can adjust but find I am having to readjust my hand very now and then."
2.0,"I had one of this previously, one of my favorites. This one failwd quick but there is a new one in black."
2.0,Just not enough storage. The content is great but with animated books taking up 500mb you can only have so much with 16 gig before formatting and before OS.
2.0,"The tablet arrived quickly & seemed sturdy but would not connect to Google. Three attempts to reset system with no luck. Poor tech support... 24 hr wait just to be told via email they needed more information :( I don't know about you, but I want to be up and running right away. Sorry...it's not a keeper."
2.0,"This was recommended to me by a friend (he was very insistent on me making this purchase). It is very practical for me as I like to move about a lot and the cords on a normal headset can be very frustrating. The auto-mute when you raise the arm is a very clever addition, while the macros on the side of the headset can be useful if needed; although I don't use them. It's has high functionality and is good for an average computer user. On the flipside, I encountered some software issues where the headset would automatically mute, but I did find a simple fix here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3eblnw/brothers_anyone_with_logitech_g930_headset_that/<br />Turning the headset on and off makes a strange buzzing noise, and the button is only triggered when held for three seconds, which does not seem useful at all. The microphone quality is also terrible, but this should be expected on a wireless headset. All in all, it was a decent purchase and it also allows me to take pee breaks without taking off my headset, much to the annoyance of my friends.<br /><br />UPDATE: The wireless connectivity range has been reduced to approximately 5 metres after two weeks of use."
2.0,"It is a micro usb cable. That's about it.<br /><br />But the cables seem to low capacity and take forever to charge. I previously used Anker's micro USB cable which had worn down over time. I have had good success with Amazon's micro USB 3.0 cable, but this seems to be quite different. I regrettably have moved back to Anker for this particular cable."
2.0,Charge very slow compare to original charger.
2.0,"I will not buy these again. Even tho they are long, my iPhone reads them as &#34;accessory not accepted&#34; and then it stops charging. I have to constantly unplug then plug it back in, and that is the same for all three chargers that came in the pack."
2.0,The disc was not readable and the multiple drivers I tried only allowed only 800 x 600 even when plugged into a 3.0 port...  I will gladly give this product a better rating if I'm given a driver that makes the device function as advertised.
2.0,had get a IT person to reload the Microsoft.
2.0,The distance between the VGA and audio jack is too short for the laptop I bought this for.
2.0,"disappointed, no micro sd or sd expand option, the storage in the tablet Is not enough"
2.0,"Sorry, not even worth the low price that I paid. I've these about a month and the wire which is at the connector that goes into the game controller is already exposed. I will pay more to get more, next time."
2.0,"I have only had this product for two week. At first I really liked it. I downloaded the kindle reading app - which works great. I have had some problems with Windows where it kicks me out of the Network and I can't use anything on the device. Twice today I have hit the power button to &#34;wake up&#34; the device, which then prompts me to put in my password. Once I do that, the little icon spins and spins and spins and spins and it says &#34;Locked&#34; and &#34;Welcome&#34; at the same time. I cannot get the tablet to do anything for at least 20 minutes where it then seems to reset and require the password again.<br />Another issue I have found is there are tiny scratches on my screen. First I thought they were smudge marks but then have realized that the keys on the keyboard are scratching the screen when it is closed. I find this ridiculous since it is designed to be closed that way.<br />I am writing this review because I was promised a &#34;No Hassle Return&#34; if I did. Yes this product wasn't that expensive, but it is too much to give me this many problem. I plan on returning it - and also the extra case and screen protectors I ordered after I found the scratches."
2.0,"Daughter received this as a birthday gift. As far a tablet...it does what you would expect it to. It's a good size for our daughter. But immediately upon using we began having issues with getting it to charge. Yes, we are using the charger that came with it. It only charges sometimes; and when it does it constantly cycles through some power on/power off thing. Sometimes it will take 12 hours to get it to a full charge again. Very, very disappointed in this tablet."
2.0,It got damaged after a few months of use. What a piece of trash
2.0,It was too cheap and it did not work. Tossed it.
2.0,"Worked well at first, then after a few months i noticed my son's tablet falling out of it"
2.0,"This case is effective as a covering, but does not do well as a stand."
2.0,"worked at first ,stops working after transfer service"
2.0,"These stopped working about four months after I bought them.  I don't know what happened but they were getting confused with my Bluetooth speaker, so I gave up trying to fix it since I would wind up with no sound at all."
2.0,"The case is alright, but doesn't snap on completely and stay on like I would've liked."
2.0,beware memory speed is 10700 instead of 14900
2.0,Much too heavy for carry on travel
2.0,I returned this item I thought it included the tablet and I needed the tablet it was my mistake  Thanks
2.0,The pad is rolled up inside the packaging.  Even after weeks of use it never fully flattens out.  Annoying to use.  Unfortunate because it is otherwise of good quality.  Packaging this flat would fix the problem.  Or use a thinner material that flattens out.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I ordered this case for my sister in law and when it came, it didn't fit.  She has the iPad Air and it's smaller than the iPad 2,3,4.  I thought she had a full sized iPad. When I contacted Amazon they said they would send me a return label but the order was placed under a different email ID and I can't open the link to print the return label."
2.0,"Be warned: very thin bag, while useful for specific circumstances it is closer to fabric than plastic, and I did not feel very secure leaving my laptop in it. That said, if you are just looking for a shoulder strap and good pattern this may work for you."
2.0,"The case looks cheap and it doesn't stand up well, it constantly falls over."
2.0,Not as expected
2.0,Not readily compatible with Mac Computers(despite the advertisement).  Had to use my Windows system.
2.0,Lights are cool must sit on hard top surface or the fans won't run.
2.0,Did not sick well. The end keep flexing up
2.0,"The front cover sewing was open, and the magnets slit out, the horizontal positions are not at comfortable angle they stand at almost 75° instead of a more comfortable 45°-60 °, although the looks are pretty nice"
2.0,"I bought TWO pieces but one of them is not working for using it less than 2 months. It can't be formatted or recognized by different PC.  I think it should be a warranty period of 1 year, so I can entile either a replacement or a refund. Please take necessary actions."
2.0,I purchased two of these sleeves along with two Dell CRM3120-1667 11.6-Inch Chromebooks. They don't fit. I guess I'll be returning them.
2.0,"When I bought this for my daughter, I knew it wasn't going to compare to a kindle or iPad.  That being said, this isn't ever up to my mediocre standards. I wanted something that my 10 yr old could occasionally play games on & contact relatives.  The camera quality is horrible.  I should have listened more to other reviews concerning battery life....this tablet is constantly plugged in but always needs charging!  If you run the battery under 30%, it literally takes hours to recharge.  Extremely disappointed."
2.0,"I ended up returning this.  It works, but the responsiveness is pretty bad, as well as the feel of the D-pad and ABXY buttons.  I was using this with ZSNES.  When I use my XBox 360 controller the responsiveness is perfect, but using this it felt off.  I wanted something that felt like the original but this didn't cut it.  If anyone knows why this acted like this with ZSNES please reply to this review WITH A SOLUTION."
2.0,Needs to developed with the consumer in mind. This products development makes one wonder how the management oversaw the design and information process.
2.0,"Great product, solidly made... if you are wanting to hookup an external hard-drive. However. It will not work with my old firewire 400 CD/DVD Burner.<br />Which, was why to bought it in the first place."
2.0,"The picture posted is not what you receive. What you receive is a charger identical to a standard apple charger. This product worked great for a day. I have since plugged it in to the extension cable from my previous apple charger and within 3 or 4 hours it began to emit a high frequency sound. I touched the cord and felt electricity running through my hand. Nothing harmful, but definitely not safe. I will wait a few days, but will most likely return this product."
2.0,I've been trying to connect to WiFi for an hour since I received my device. It picks up every network in my building other than mine. Cool product.
2.0,The gold color looks like a clear case with a crappy spray paint job. Returned.
2.0,"If you are looking for an alternative to running Ethernet but still want a wired connection then go for this, keep in mind they offer a set just for that without wifi for cheaper. Wired speed is acceptable if your on different phases of your breaker. Wired speed on the same phase is exceptional. Wifi speed is awful, regardless of how good the wired speed is. Tweaking wifi settings helps a bit but not much. If you looking for a wifi extender, this is not the product for you. Neither is a wifi repeater, tried that too. I have coax cable running through the house, going to bite the bullet and build a MoCA network as you can get near Ethernet speeds with that, then hook a proper access point to it.  All I have learned trying different devices is you get what you pay for, so of you want cheap than expect cheap performance."
2.0,"Pretty good overall.  Product says 8gb, but after the OS and other default software, you only have 5 gb for your own use.  Would be better with some more storage space.  With only 5gb it can't really replace my other tablet."
2.0,"Product was nice looking but did not fit on my brand new 15inch Mac book Pro :(<br />I unfortunately left out of town and was not able to return the product so I am out 20+ dollars, do not reccommend buying for 15inch Mac Book Pro as it did not fit, VERY DISAPPOINTED &#62;:("
2.0,"I'll keep it since it's not worth the extra effort returning. Other pictures show that the case is clear but there's a frosted finish that I wasn't anticipating instead of the glossy finish that a lot of the other pictures show... It's cheap enough for me to use it since I bought it to protect my laptop from school and it seems pretty sturdy enough to last me a while. Mine came with a keyboard protector so that was a pleasant surprise but I would rather the case be a completely clear and glossy finish instead of just throwing in the keyboard protector. If it does break, I won't be repurchasing this particular case."
2.0,The TeckNet BM306 Bluetooth mouse works great when it's functionable. I was very happy with the product and it was easy to set up and connect to my Samsung Galaxy 4 7.0. But after ten days of use the mouse seems like it has become possessed by some supernatural power. When scrolling the wheel pages on the web jump around and when attempting to navigate pages on my tablet it has a mind of it's own. At first I was going to give this product 5 stars for value and quality but I will have to send it back. Maybe if you order one it will work just fine.
2.0,One worked. The other one don't even work
2.0,"The disk is incompatible with older version of M.2 standard, because of DEVSLP and there is no warning about it. It disappeared after boot on my Lenovo y510p. I complained to ADATA, but I got a replacement instead of my money back, now I have to sell it myself.  UPDATE: I managed to run it by switching from AHCI to IDE (Compatible) mode in BIOS. I had edit registry for Windows not to crash and regenerate initramfs for Linux not to crash after that change. Also the read speed will be 1/3rd of the original, so that actually sucks."
2.0,"This was probably the sweetest looking mouse I had ever seen looking at it in its clear packaging but the unfortunate reality is that this thing feels cheap as hell. The unit is really light to the point where it feels like a cheap hollow shell. Very quickly, the plastic texture will start to visibly show where your fingers and palm rest on it, with  a dark mark, making it look dirty even if you clean it. It often makes really awful squeaking when you click. This is caused  by crumbs getting  under the buttons and can be corrected but it can be pretty  difficult and I find myself having to do so so often that I just gave up. Its just always squeaky. This is an ambidextrous mouse but it is implemented very poorly. The grips that keep your fingers from dragging on the mousepad, that were a major selling point for me, can't really both be used at the same time because both are curved to fit a thumb. Its really uncomfortable for the other fingers and while you can of course swap that side for the alternate grip, your fingers will then drag on the mouse pad. I also think it looks pretty unappealing aesthetically when you have mismatched side grips. The battery life is pretty bad too. From a full charge I can get 4, maybe 5 hours of use out of it. The laser often performs very poorly. It sometimes will fail to detect mouse movement, it will randomly lower the dpi level without input and it fails to recognize when you try to adjust it with the buttons. Really frustrating when you're in the middle of a game of league. And all this in under a weeks worth of use, I went right back to my Rat MMO. Huge waste of money, the price is absolutely absurd considering the build quality. This would be more appropriately priced at around $40. If you want a high end gaming mouse (like &#62;$100) you would be better off with any of the other razer micete"
2.0,"Slow write speed.<br /><br />I have this hooked up to to a 6Gbs SATA conneciton and when I run AS SSD on it the write speed is barely faster than my 80GB 10,000 rpm Raptor physical drive.<br /><br />Read speed is around 340, but write speed is dismal for an SSD.<br /><br />I suspect that I unwittingly purchased the V300 after Kingston performed their bait and switch.<br />I can't return it since it's not 'broken'.<br />But I can post here to let people know of another person affect by this.<br /><br />Insert standard Kingston response below......"
2.0,"Would not recommend this cable. Bought it because it was cheaper with out reading reviews. This cable does not stay attached to the Pebble very well at all. It will charge if you set the pebble on edge with the charger underneath, so 2 stars reluctantly. The savings is far from worth the hassle."
2.0,"It may be the specific keyboard I received and not the product in general, but the E, R, and T keys are much stiffer than the other keys (and much stiffer than keys on a keyboard should be) and this makes typing a misery, since I either have to hit those keys very hard, or I end up with missed letters. Since I use my keyboard constantly for my work, I will be replacing this keyboard tout suite."
2.0,"This worked fine for DV&#34;I pass through, but the VGA didn't work... Disappointing that they don't mention it isn't a converter...."
2.0,"SOmetimes it didn't work at all. It would send static and flashing pictures. When it did work, it did not allow me to fill the screen with my work. It would always bleed. No matter what resolution I set it on, it was always hanging off the edge of the screen. I bought another one which had the same problem, so maybe it is the nature of the beast, but I still wish someone would have told me about it before I bought it."
2.0,Said that it worked for time Warner it did not so unable to use
2.0,"I bought this tablet not expecting a lot for the price, and desiring to use it only to run a handful of low demand apps and play some downloaded videos. I understood the speaker wouldn't be great, and use an external speaker. I understood the screen would not be top grade. (It looks fine viewed straight on.)<br /><br />The killer for me is this issue of being unable to download apps because of insufficient space. (I think likely google is more to blame for this than anybody. My wife has a phone with the same issue.) Basically, because of the way the internal storage is partitioned, there is actually only about 1.9 GB of room for apps. The infuriating thing is that right out of the box, this space is almost entirely filled with all the google apps....and there is a ton of them! So when you go to download a new app, THERE IS NO ROOM! The google operating system won't let you move any of these google apps to the other partition. You can move other apps...IF you can download them in the first place without getting error messages. You can gain a little space by emptying the cache, but not enough to make room for a new app. Don't think that adding an SD card is a fix. There is no way to use this space for anything other than storing your own personal pictures and videos....it is no help with the app storage space issue.<br /><br />Astro Queo has provided a firmware update via email which is designed to make the internal storage one usable partition. Unfortunately the process is complex and can fail at any number of steps. Also, it requires loosing all your data and starting over. Furthermore, it only works using a Windows 8 computer. (Mine is a Windows 7)<br /><br />Since I don't use most of the preinstalled google apps, I was able to gain some space by disabling some of them, but you have to be careful as some google apps may be needed to operate some things you need. I gained enough room to install a couple of my desired personal apps, but am again very close to being right up against the issue of no room to download new apps and their needed updates from time to time.<br /><br />I give 2 stars because I think it is just unacceptable to sell a device that needs an immediate firmware update right out of the box, to even make it usable for the most basic things. (You have to be a techie to be able to do it, and need Windows 8.) I could live with the other expected limitations of an inexpensive tablet, but this storage issue is a killer. Unacceptable."
2.0,"It works. It's a cord, people. It will work or it won't. If you are expecting some great, new video quality out of this or any other cord, quit right now and read some REAL reviews. I only gave two stars so somebody might look and see what I wrote and learn something. The gold-plated cords are no better than any other. IT'S  A BUNCH OF WIRES THAT CONNECT TO POINT ON ONE END AND CONNECT TO OTHERS ON THE OTHER END. End story."
2.0,It worked pretty well for about 2 weeks then my grandson  broke it. I didn't get insurance on it.
2.0,"After having my kindle fire for 3 years, the skype app started to freeze after only 5 minutes of a conversation.  It took me a very long time to even find a phone number to reach anyone who could help with my device.  After a week of four technicians, and following all directions from setting the device back to factory settings, holding the power button, etc. and syncing, it still didn't work.  The third technician offered a deal of &#34;giving&#34; me an upgraded model of the kindle (which apparently retails for about $400) for $200.  I told him that I was not going to pay Amazon any more money as this is ridiculous.  He gave me another number and told me that I needed to wait 24 hours and then call a technician would be be able to help me further.  Okay, so I waited 48 hours and was told that there is nothing they can do for me, except for the original offer of an upgraded kindle for $200. Needless to say, I'll sit at my desktop and skype for $0.  I will not buy another device from amazon.  The apple products are looking pretty good right now!"
2.0,Directions are very confusing which made me end up with a bunch of bubbles..
2.0,Very cheap and poorly made.  The light does not provide adequate light to read.
2.0,"I bought this Tablet for Christmas gift to my daughther, The device worked OK initially, however it seems to have problems with the OS of the device, the Tablet emit sounds however the display is  always black, so from december 25 Th I cannot use the tablet. It would be useful to communicate with people of Toshiba in order to sove this situation"
2.0,"Dull finish, not very attractive. I got it because I didnt like the silver color of my laptop. Doesnt seem to ofer any significant protection against bumps. Goes on easily despite lack of instructions."
2.0,I used this while I was a student in college. With heavy usage on my laptop the case broke down fairly quickly. First things to go were the small pieces of plastic that hold the case onto the laptop. I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,This webcam is barely supported by Windows 8-10 and it is from MICROSOFT.  Their site says that they have o updated software.  If you use a lower version of Windows it works fine.  That is my experience as of August 2015.
2.0,Good Product Bad Drivers
2.0,"PROS:<br />Cheap laptop, good hard drive space (500 GB), large screen, works well if all you need is internet access to check/send email and casually browse websites. I would buy this laptop for my mother if she needed one - because all she does is send/check emails and &#34;Likes&#34; my Facebook posts :)<br /><br />CONS:<br />Windows 8.1, loaded with bloatware (like an insane amount), has one USB port on the left side, the remaining two are located in the back (WTF?), the headphone jack is also located in the back.... middle back.... (WTF?!), so when I plug in head phones the cord is extremely short and my face needs to be extremely close to the screen (very uncomfortable), no CD drive (isn't this standard with almost every other laptop manufactured?), while the screen is large the quality isn't great (watching YouTube videos on 720p is pretty much the same as watching it in 480), don't even try gaming on this laptop.... by &#34;gaming&#34; I mean not even Facebook gaming (powered by FLASH)... slowest sh*t you will ever go through, and just to throw in - the built in camera has AWFUL quality (unusable in daylight AND lowlight).<br /><br />Good laptop for any person that is not computer savvy AT ALL, a student that needs to type papers and do minimal web based research for said papers<br /><br />I'm keeping mine as a backup to my backup... and because I received it as a gift and didn't pay a dime for it."
2.0,Overpriced piece of equipment.
2.0,"As delivered June 2015, this router has some quality problems.  I connected it to a wireless broadband antenna and had expected connectivity for 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks, the connection between the router and the tower (through the WISP provided antenna) kept dropping.  It took about a month of troubleshooting with the WISP and Netgear.  Three phone calls later with Netgear revealed that the router construction is prone to dropping connections.  Netgear sent a different unit (model WNDR 4300) as a replacement, forcing me to re-set the entire home network and to re-sync it with the WISP.  I'll probably buy a different brand next time; the good reviews on this one weren't worth much to me this time.  Zero stars for quality on the first unit, 2 stars for Netgear making good on replacing defect"
2.0,"Its already failing I received this pump Aug 6, 2015 and its August 26 2015 as of this post. Its already started grinding and chugging and water level is all the way to the top of the gauge.  Going to contact for replace/refund. But it means my PC will be down until I get a replacement part."
2.0,"It is at the service depot for the second time already, and have only had it for about two months.  When it works, it does so well.  But far too many crashes. It is back from service depot (2nd time), and just recovered from a hard crash."
2.0,"This device works fairly well in router mode but I bought it so I could use it in Bridge Mode when travelling to get around motel Internet sign-on screens and use my Chromecast.  I expected it to be a little slower but when in Bridge Mode it is usually unbearable slow, I say usually because a few times it seemed OK but generally I have found it to be unusable for this purpose.  At the last Motel I tried it at the normal connection speed (using the OOKLA speed test) was 15Mb Down and 5 Mb Up. Connecting via this device made it .9Mb Down and .9Mb Up and it was continually disconnecting.  I tried the latest Firmware with no change in performance.  The HooToo web site provides little or no useful support information.  I will continue to watch for updates but for now I am going to try the Netgear Trek, hoping I get better results."
2.0,"Well made and sturdy, but the wireless connection on it is garbage. There is a small delay that can sometimes get up to a one second delay."
2.0,It runs slow and there's no Bluetooth icon and when i try to turn it on it says settings not responding 🙎💁💁
2.0,"Its nice as it is protective. I was just looking for a stand case and this sucks at standing up so I can set it down and watch something on it. I have other cases for my other tablets that I prefer better. I wish I can return, but they charge almost same price to send it back so no point."
2.0,Fits snug but the rubber finish is pilling off.
2.0,This product started to fail after one year in use.  Guess I'm going to contact product support for warranty replacement.
2.0,Not real impressed with this modle. I previously had a first generation Kindle fire and I was happier with it. The apps work better.
2.0,Doesn't fit my Kindle Fire and returning it seems complicated.
2.0,"Alienware 14x WiFi stopped working, same as with every other owner of this laptop.<br />Purchased this as a temporary measure, but ended up using it full time.<br />Not the greatest WiFi adapter but performs with very little problems, for the exception of the times when it stops<br />performing at peak operation. Happens a few times a week.<br />Always thought it was my router or modem until I decided to do a speed test from my IPhone, 22mb iPhone, Edimax adapter, 1.2mb or less if not reset or removed then reinserted into its usb port."
2.0,Sandisk 8GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter are not those received are different
2.0,"The product is a lot bulkier and bigger than it looks compared to the pictures. Since it is so big and bulky, it can cover up some of your ports on the side of your laptop. It does not stick on very well and it is constantly falling off when you are carrying your laptop elsewhere. It is very annoying. It is only good when you have your laptop set on the table. If it only mount better onto the laptop, then the size would not matter as much. The vacuum is quite loud when turned on fully max. The plus side is that it does indeed cool downs your laptop tremendously. It does a better job than a cooling pad."
2.0,"This bag looks good and can hold a lot of things. In less than a year ,one of the wheels rubber came off. When I contacted  seller about replacement  part for the  wheel ,they stated wheel can not be replaced  .  I rate this product a two because  it is not that  durable ."
2.0,"The battery worked great for a few weeks, but now it won't hold a charge for more than an hour. Spend the extra money and get the top of the line battery."
2.0,"I've owned two of the Logitech H800 the first pair would no longer charge when the charging port wore out after about 4 months, on the second pair the mic gave out after three months.  I won't be purchasing this product again."
2.0,hot problems connecting to home Wi-Fi reset it to factory defaults and have not been able to access it since. it will not register
2.0,"I was given this Kindle for my birthday. Excellent for night reading, but here are my difficulties.  I own a Kindle Touch, for about four years, love reading it, needed more light. I have difficulty with the home page.  Where is a simple table of content, displaying the titles of my books? Instead I am looking at grey covers of the books I am reading and have difficulty reading the titles, grey variations on grey, not easy. Just give me the printed list of titles.  Also the ads, they are displayed on almost half of the lower screen, not elegant, too busy and really? With my older Kindle the ads were interesting and non intrusive, not listed with my book covers that I am currently or queued for reading.  Quite disturbing when asked by children, am I really reading that? I wish I had seen the format before asking for it for my birthday."
2.0,"Worked fine for six month then stopped working. Could have been physical damage from rough use, but didn't see any visible signs of it."
2.0,"This case did not ship until 2 weeks after I purchased it. Love the color, but it is VERY difficult to put on without somewhat damaging your computer, which a complete paradox of what this product is supposed to do. Overall disappointing."
2.0,"Purchased this tablet primarily for Pandora use for my 1 year old; it was Lollipop 5.0, a decent processor and the price was absolutely right.  The speaker level at maximum couldn't be heard over a Vornado fan at medium power, the resolution of the screen was bad enough that I thought there was a piece of plastic covering the screen, and the camera resolution is pathetic (1.6megapixel on the rear and .9 megapixel on the front).  As mentioned by some others, it's a pretty SLOW device and the internal 4GB available memory isn't that much.  Save your money and go with something better."
2.0,Quality looks good on tv but sound doesn't go through TV...
2.0,Very disappointed that I cannot add the silk browser to Freetime. Makes this device pretty much useless for what I bought it for (my son using it at school). Cannot turn off access to the cloud either. I do not want him having access to the games and mostly the books I have on my account!  This device will be sitting on the shelf unused for now because of this.
2.0,Quality feels very cheap and not like it would be long lasting.
2.0,It broke after about three months of use.  Strange buzzing from the right ear.
2.0,"I purchased the Modem / Router combination in January and called the support team for a number of issues . Very poor support extremely long wait times to connect to a technician . I will say the Modem is great and I get 330 mps /22  from time warner , the router is the problem .Drops lan connections between computers all hard wired ,no wireless too weak for practical use . I finally gave up and paid the support f $ 130 for one year . i am treated much better and they have a real interest and shorter times to connect to a technician . The technicians attempted a fix the router but realized that only factory default will help . Thus we did it and all my problems went away for a couple of days . The problems returned and we did another factory default and again improvement for a couple of days. I do like the ease of communicating with the concierge service $130.00 extra support feels like I am calling Apple. I do wish the support was as good in the first 3 months but only if you pay extra . So at least I know for sure that the router is a piece of junk and I will shut it off and just use the modem with another brand of router. a lot money spent to get to this conclusion ."
2.0,"there may have been something wrong with the one I received. it would not stay on a screen, it kept jumping to another screen. for example, if I were reading my email it would for no reason jump to the keyboard screen to type something. it became intolerable and I sent it back."
2.0,"Mouse is okay, keyboard is like a toy."
2.0,"Cannot recommend.  My touchpad started out fine, but over time it has become overly sensitive.  It selects whole sections or drags things around without any real user action.  I have turned off everything possible, reinstalled the drivers, made the pointer and double click work as slow as possible, cleaned the surface, even tried to overlay the pad with packing tape .  At best I got temporary improvement.  It is still unreliable and scary.  Searching the web, there are many users that have this same issue for many years.  Logitech evidently has chosen not to make any fixes.  I guess if it doesn't effect sales, why fix it.<br />For awhile (9 months) it was great, now it is just scary."
2.0,"The design of this mouse leaves something to be desired.  The shape of it causes my wrist to ache after extended use.  Also, the battery lasts barely a day.  I do not recommend."
2.0,"It's smaller than my kindle fire, can't see that it offers anything special"
2.0,"Bought to use with AT&T dsl but after wasting a month going back and forth with AT&T, I found out they cannot provide internet to my house. I went to return this and found the return period had expired. So now annoyed with AT&T and Amazon."
2.0,This does not fit all Macbook Air Laptops. There should be a picture clearly showing what the end of the charger looks like.
2.0,"I purchased item &#34;Cable Matters® 2 Pack, Cat6 Modular Plugs with Inserts for Solid Cables 100 Pieces per Pack&#34; for a small project (50 or so runs). I've made more cables with different tools and plugs than I care to remember.<br /><br />These are the worst Cat6 plugs I've ever used. They take easily 5x longer to properly terminate. I'm throwing them right in the garbage if they can't be returned simply because $20-$30 bucks is not worth the extra hours upon hours these will cost me.<br /><br />Stick to quality 3 piece plugs from a good brand."
2.0,slow transfer rate... but cheap
2.0,This charger didn't last long for me.  The cord pulled away from the box in the middle and was showing bare wire underneath.  I hadn't noticed this and it sparked and burnt my hardwood floor.  You get what you pay for.  I ended up having to go ahead and buy the actual Dell power adapter and it has held up much better.  I would recommend just biting the bullet and paying the extra for the Dell brand. This power adapter would probably work fine if you never move your laptop around much and never plan to roll the cord up or move it much.
2.0,"this mat is &#34;meh&#34; for me. I know two other gamers who own and like this exact mat, so I gave it a shot. Of the three of us, I'm the only one with a Razer mouse, both of them have the same strange issue of &#34;lagging&#34; on the pad, as if i was using a magazine as a mat. aside from that, which may end up being a hardware issue (however unlikely, having un/reinstalled all drivers and calibration etc), I find it to be much too thin and light, and it slides around my desk with normal use. The size is nice, but that hardly makes up for it's shortcomings in my opinion. in short, there are better mats at walmart for a similar price."
2.0,it shard to put on and it makes squeaky noises because the hard plastic is rubbing on the hinges.
2.0,"I supposed I got what I should have expected from a $5 mouse. It has a cheap feel and look. It worked alright for the first few weeks I got it and then I stared having problems.  The sensor sometimes flashes unexpectedly which cause the mouse to malfunction. Sometimes the mouse would just stop working all together and I would either need to turn it off and on again or disconnect the USB portion from my computer to fix the connection. Now, the cursor has just disappeared from my computer screen altogether when I try to turn it on and use it. If i hover over something on my screen, it still highlights as if the cursor is there, it's not visible. Overall, I got what I paid for and I really didn't expect it to last to long anyway."
2.0,Screen keep freezing only had it for a week and half .
2.0,"Bought this to hook up a Cisco switch in another part of the suite and once run, it didn't have enough signal to use the switch.  It would work for internet when hooked up directly though.  I'm guessing it was because of the very thin 'shielding' it has.  Had to go buy another cable somewhere else and once I had them laid side by side noticed that this cable was only about 130 feet long.  Buy because its cheap but spend more if it is mission critical."
2.0,"I am on my second one now and need to replace it again.  The rubber feet have come off and when two comes off from the opposite corners - the laptop is wobbly when you set it on any flat surface.  Further, I have never dropped it and the corner crack and small pieces fall off - leaving very sharp edges.  I am going to look at another brand for 1/2 the cost.  Lost out on $50 here with the purchase two."
2.0,"Case is perfectly fine for the price I paid. However, the keyboard is terrible. I have to push at least three times for a R to appear and if I press once, I get two o's. I would recommend spending more and getting a better keyboard as this one was not worth the money."
2.0,Awful sound at medium & high frequency. Bass is good though. Do not recommend.
2.0,"I made this purchase because I thought this would process by pictures quickly.  This card is the slowest card I have, and I have some cheap cards."
2.0,TF slot does not work.  The quality is low. Feels cheap. Memory cards don't go in smoothly. This product is made in China.
2.0,Broke the day I got it I was charging my batteries  and it was a very tight fit to the controller and it just fell apart
2.0,"This cover is poor quality, and does not fit the keys on the keyboard too perfectly. You still feel the edge of the rubber when typing and is not the best compared to others I have used. Not my favorite."
2.0,This product did not fit the HP Envy 360 2 in 1 15.6&#34; touch screen computer.
2.0,"Constantly drops wifi, my son has a difficult time using it and keeps downloading items he doesn't mean too maxing out the storage. Its not user friendly. I should have went with an Android or iPad."
2.0,Delaminates after 6 months. Pleather came off plastic.
2.0,Product has intermit connection problems.
2.0,"I'll lead with the pros: the machine would potentially be a beast, it has a good screen, lots of memory and the best mobile GPU out there.<br /><br />The reason nobody should buy this machine is, simply put, that it crashes. I'm talking about machine freezing blue screen of death crashes that happen while gaming (every 20 minutes or so of FPS gaming) and, especially painful for my use case, while using virtualization technology.<br />The whole systems freezes with a machine check exception any time you try to install Linux, both as a guest OS and as a secondary operating system.  (All this was tried with both the bios and drivers that the machines shipped with and with the latest bios and drivers. Tested with multiple bios options).<br /><br />MSI Support reproduced the issue so unfortunately it looks like a design flaw of the machine (my guess would be a bios/firmware issue).<br /><br />There are a few more issues with the machine (for example the fact that it requires a reboot to switch between the 2 available video cards and that it requires windows to do so, thus making it impossible to use exclusively an alternative operating system).<br /><br />Basically its instability while gaming (which it is designed for) and the impossibility of running Linux on it make this machine a huge missed opportunity."
2.0,"Bought this in Feb of this year and its already breaking. Will stop working after about 15 minutes of use, have to unplug and plug it back in to get it to work. I have my old mouse and used it in its place and that old mouse still works no problem. No support on finalmouse website that I can find :-("
2.0,Not work as I expect.
2.0,Not as durable as you would think for Swiss gear !! I have been using this bag for about 2 months and it already is tearing at the seams!!!!!! I carry a Laptop and a few other things but it is not over packed and it's already tearing up. Not a good durable buy
2.0,"While this keyboard is very quiet it does not function properly.  I think the main issue is the wireless component, when typing it double types letters, freezes and all around does not function well.  I think if they made it with a wire then the response time issues would be solved.  Had to stop using this after a few weeks and will be buying something different now.  It is too bad because I really liked the look, feel, and noise level of this keyboard."
2.0,"Was great, for a while.  At first I was getting exceptional battery life.  I have had it for about a year and have hesitated to write up until now because I feel that these type of products need a good length of time before giving an honest review.<br /><br />I bought this for my Late 2008 Macbook and it was great at first.  I use this Mac infrequently but it was good for when I did use it.  Now after only having 39 charge cycles on it, I am lucky to get an hour of charge on this battery.  I would expect such a short time if I was using my Mac for processor heavy things such as video editing or video playback, but this happens after only browsing the web.  I am getting the same battery life as I did with the original battery, which prompted me to order this one.  Perhaps seek another product if you want it to last more than a year, not sure the typical life of these things but considering I have very low charge cycles it seems it went quick."
2.0,Only works half the time
2.0,Great but can not remove the sticker gum from #3..the third step....afraid to use Goof Off
2.0,"I didn't care for the texture of the product. It fit well on the watch. Didn't lift. It does add a very slight grainy look, hardly noticeable (I'm very picky). I waited 72 hrs to see if the material would eventually lay smooth, I even tried warming it slightly with a hair dryer. See for yourself. You may like the fact that it truly covers most of the watch face and shows mostly no edge (unlike the glass protector I now use.)"
2.0,Does not work without a disc and they dont put this is in the description!  Now all this money for nothing.
2.0,"I've had this for about two months now and it has already broken. I keep my laptop in my purse for work and sometimes (maybe once or twice during this time frame) I place my purse down harder than I should, but it shouldn't be hard enough to break the case. The top part of the case does not stay on the laptop anymore. Extremely disappointed."
2.0,"Most of the features are nice, but disappointed in the short battery life. When I fully charge it the battery is dead again the next morning even though I did not use and closed all programs. I also wish I could use a different operating system than the default silk."
2.0,"The mouse was okay however after 3 months of use it had died.  The computer no longer recognized it because the USB portion malfunctioned.  I had tried it on several computers with the same outcome.<br /><br />Pros:  Customizable buttons, fun lights<br /><br />Cons: Big mouse, auxiliary buttons get in the way of normal use at times, cord length is only 5 ft"
2.0,"WOW, what a major disappointment, pulled up PassMark and this cards performance for the grand I paid vs my several year old GTX580 OC was way pathetic.  Yes in 3D it outperformed most cards, but truth is the 980 performs almost as well in some instances better than this card, in 2D the 980 was equal or better than my 580, the Titan wasn't worth the test wait.<br />Kind of a waste of an evening, install cards, remove cards, reinstall cards, clean inside PC case, install some cool LED lights, fiddle around making them work, hook everything back up after unhooking it several times, yawn.......get return slips......geesh.....<br />Maybe I'm not getting it, or as some have said the 8 gig of System RAM isn't adequate to maximize this cards potential???  But, for a 1000 dollars back it goes, nothing against EVGA, I've owned many of their cards and this is the first instance I've been disappointed, maybe I'll look at the 7 series as it appears it's the value high end card at this time."
2.0,The shift key placement on the right side is absolutely horrific. I'm always pressing pg up instead. Avoid this if you touch type. Get the updated version!
2.0,I like ASUS products but this one has terrible 2.4 GHz connections that randomly drop to single digit Mbps for no reason while in the same room.  5 Ghz works much better but the connection to the internet still seems the &#34;shut off&#34; temporarily at times.  Going to replace it since many of my devices are still using 2.4 GHz.  Hopefully this was just a bad apple in an otherwise nice product line from ASUS.
2.0,very disappointed Wish I'd have stayed with hp products as I have used nothing but in  the past !!!!~
2.0,"I am a huge fan of Steel Series. But these ruined my 5 star history with them. I used the Steel Series V2 for years and had 2 headsets and even gifted them to friends and streamers based on how highly I thought of them. So like a naive consumer, I figured the V3s would be an ever better experience.<br /><br />Three weeks in, the poorly glued adjusting band came apart, leaving a floppy faux leather strip constantly whipping against my head when I removed them. Then I a problem developed in voice chat across many software platforms (skype, teamspeak, steam chat and mumble) where people could hear the sounds from my headphones in the call. I am not sure if this is a faulty internal thing where the mic is too sensitive, but there is not a setting that has allowed me to prevent this.<br /><br />Everything about the V3s has felt inferior to the V2s, the cushion adjustable head band, gone. The quality of separate line audio/mic, gone. The convenient and secure Mute button on the line, not gone, but on the headset, which means fumbling against my head to make sure I am muted."
2.0,cheap battery.  does not hold a charge like the genuine OEM battery.
2.0,"Pros: great sound, covers the whole ear, isolates you from the world.<br />Cons: heavy, uncomfortable for long periods, squeezes too tight.<br />I own an old set of Razer Carcharies and wanted to replace them. The reviews for the HyperX were great and that is why I purchased these. However I am a gamer and this set is extremely tight and much heavier than what I am used to. This weighs around 1 - 1.5 lbs and my Razer is only 8oz. I feel the push on top of my head but the worst is the squeezing of the cups on both sides. the set is made so if you do not wear them the 2 cups meet each other (which was not evident by the photos of this product), the gaming set I have is open and leaves 6&#34; between the cups when you lay it on the table. Granted the sound is very good but this will give you a horrid headache. Wearing these also prevents you from hearing anything else but what you listen to, so if your mom is calling, phone is ringing or someone is calling for help you will be none the wiser."
2.0,"First I should say that this backpack is extremely padded, so it will protect the laptop from just about anything.<br />I wanted to love it because of its sternum strap, buckle strap in the front which can hold a lunch cooler, and awesome ergonomic design which makes you feel like you're not carrying any weight, but it's useless for us because the padding makes the usable space way too small. My son couldn't fit his 1&#34; ring looseleaf binder in the laptop section (it fit perfectly in other laptop backpacks). I'm not talking about the dedicated sleeve, but rather the entire zippered back compartment. You have to force it. It did fit in the second main compartment closer to the front of the backpack, but left no room for anything else besides for maybe 2 thin notebooks.<br />The pocket on the bottom means that the backpack falls forward even when full of books. Most others can balance when full, or at least can be made to lean backwards onto something. This one can't. The main compartment at the back doesn't open wide and isn't easily accessible. The one toward the front opens wide, but the curve of the zipper forces you to pause and reposition your hand like 3-4 times along the path and it feels like it's stuck, even though it isn't. It's not one smooth gliding motion.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the Case Logic backpack I have for myself: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002J9HBSE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_2&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER and thought I'd try Case Logic for my son, but while the VNB-217 is very roomy without looking bulky, well padded, and every compartment is easily accessible, the Griffith Park doesn't offer any of that, besides padding."
2.0,Will not connect with my wi-fi even when plugged in next to it.  Then it tries to become proprietary.  I have followed the directions in trying to connect it on several occasions and the result is always the same.
2.0,I followed the directions and my computer does not work with the battery alone.  I have to have the power cord connected too.  My computer works better than it did before but immediately dims or cuts off if the adapter charger is not plugged in at the same time.
2.0,"worked fine for 2.4ghz band, but would not stay connected on 5ghz."
2.0,I wanted to like these but 5 seconds after I pulled the box open I knew I didn't. There is a major glaring flaw in the product. Each key has a number or a letter or both on the inside of it. The keys are semi-transparent. You can see where that fails? Every key has some manufacturing mark number on it that is visible because of the backlighting and transparency. Why oh why would anyone do that? They lost all possibility of even getting on my board right there. Useless. I give an extra star for packaging very nicely. I guess these go on the backup board while I put my favorite set on my main board.<br />Disclaimer: This is a non-essential snobbery item and thus the review is somewhat snobby.
2.0,2 pack pin adapter.  First one failed at the 30 day mark - making ineligible to return.  Trying the second one to see if it will work.
2.0,It Is Not What  Was On The Website Different Name On The Product . The Tabs In The Front To Hold Laptop In Place Are Not Their.It Is All Plastic. Very Unhappy. Not Worth $8.99. Lap Top Slides Around Very Unsturdy.
2.0,"I ordered a 128 GB microSD card and was sent a 32 Gb microSD card.<br />It is a microSD card, but does not have the memory I wanted. Now I have to go through the hassle and expense of returning it and getting a replacement. What a huge hassle!"
2.0,I ordered the wrong size what can I say.
2.0,"Read the description carefully.  I missed the detail that this does not charge tablets which is a major downfall.  I really have no use for it because of that.  I kept it because the cost of shipping it back just wasn't worth it.  Also, light is BRIGHT!<br />Despite it not working for me....it does work and does what the description says it does."
2.0,"Cheap brittle plastic case.  My 2.5 inch ssd flopped around in the case.  Used the extra pad to eliminate movement and all the tiny plastic tabs that make it tool less, broke very easily.<br /><br />Im glad it broke before I could take it out into the world.  One drop, I'm sure the whole case would explode<br /><br />Crap,  don't waste your time and money.<br /><br />Edit:  Inateck got back to me about the review, and offered me two different, replacement device of the same caliber but different design ((http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=551434) and our safe buying guarantee (http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=537868)).<br /><br />I chose the FE2005, it arrives and the drive still flops around.  All though they included an extra foam pad, I honestly didn't have a pair of tweezers to install it in this model.<br /><br />I went instead with the Anker (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H98AXOE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  No flop, didn't need an extra foam pad and it definitely feels sturdier.<br /><br />Edit, edit : they asked for another star for their customer service and I will do that, because they did try to make it right.<br /><br />I would further suggest a better product from them in the future."
2.0,"Bought the black matte model, it does stay on for me but it really doesn't filter enough for any scenario I can think of e.g. Plane, classroom, cafe etc. Every picture and text is still readable from a distance and at an angle, unless the brightness is turned way down. This then makes it very hard to actually use the computer. Returning this asap."
2.0,At first this cord worked very well. After about a month or two however it started coming apart. This is the second one I've bought that's done this.
2.0,"Can you please email me @ samleo722@gmail.com because I need to send this back to you to replace the battery because the computer is not charging. I still want the laptop but something needs to be fixed because I can't use it unless it is on the charger, which is very inconvenient and displeasing. I was trying to give it a test period to see if it was just me but it is not. I wish you could email me asap to discuss how to fix this problem."
2.0,"Not actually made of leather, why lie about it?  Made of generic vinyl/plastic.  Otherwise decent."
2.0,"Did not work for me.  Instructions were minimal and somewhat misleading.  8 output formats available, but the device can only create 2 of them."
2.0,Don't buy this product. It doesn't charge your phone all the time.
2.0,"On-ear style isn't all that comfortable for me. Flimsy construction. Worked ok the first couple of times I used it but, then, the right speaker went out and only gave garbled sound. Sent it to the landfill as not worth any more bother."
2.0,Worked for first month. Mic led does not light up anymore and mic does not work. Very disappointing performance.
2.0,Did not include the silicon sleeve that it used to have.  Found a better option.
2.0,"Although the quality seems to be great, it is too bad that it does not fit the charge port opening in the Lifeproof case. Item will be returned."
2.0,"At first I was thrilled to have a quiet fan like this. Now a little over one year later, the fan begins to make loud noise. Something like this should last at least 5 years in my opinion, if not longer."
2.0,"Worked great for 5 months. Now it's completely dead at 0% and I have to plug in just to power on. Bought another from a different Amazon seller, installed last night and it lost 11% in sleep mode by morning. I'll buy one more, and then if that fails, my beloved EP121 will be retired. No warranty info comes with the product, and good luck contacting the seller."
2.0,Ok product with clear and easy directions. The rubberbands were a good idea to hold the screen protector in place.  Only drawback was when I peeled off the &#34;remove me sticker&#34; from edge left the sticky residue on edge.:-( otherwise good so far. Will update after some time.  Update=Product is cheap plastic that your finger and stylus does NOT move smoothly along. Instead of spending money on the awesome product case could have been spent on the screen protector itself. Too bad. If you just need a screen protector until you find a better one it is ok.
2.0,"I find the case to be of poor construction quality and it's very difficult to get SD cards out of the pockets once inserted. I'll still keep this because it's not worth sending back for a refund, but I won't be purchasing another one like it again."
2.0,The fan is hitting a wire and makes noises.  Waiting for it to break.
2.0,"Error messages pop up about software.  Does not load properly. Screen goes blank at times.  You get what you pay for, next time I'll buy &#34;new&#34; .  Save your money and buy &#34;new&#34; computer from a store."
2.0,This did not even come with they keyboard cover like it was advertised. Pretty annoyed and disappointed.
2.0,"Ok, so about a month ago I bought this product. When it came to my house I put it in my xbox. The main reason that I bought it was for the motor to open the disk tray since my other one was broken. When the motor worked I expected everything to go well. But of course it didn't. This disk drive won't read my games at all. I checked all the chords but still, it doesn't work."
2.0,you get what you pay for
2.0,"Samsung at the time of writing this review has not released software in order to install SSD on to Win 10 PC.<br />Samsung Data Migration, and Samsung Magician Software that come with their SSD are not Win 10 compatible."
2.0,I don't usually write reviews to put it simply i got the wrong screen on the product description<br />Screen Size: 15.6&#34;<br />Connector: 30 Pins<br />Screen Finish: Glossy<br />Maximum Resolution: 1366*768<br />1 Year Warranty<br /><br />but i got a 40 Pins connector i am very disappointed
2.0,The cover came with dirty stains in the inside.
2.0,The grip is too small for me. I have to squeeze the button pretty tight.
2.0,I don't like that I only have a certain amount of time to read a book.
2.0,The ball is very very loose! I am contemplating on returning for a more expensive one.
2.0,"cheaply made and came apart before i even opened it.<br />save your money and buy a nicer, branded mouse bungee."
2.0,"I've had this laptop for 8 months now with very light use- maybe once a week for a couple hours.  I find that the main power button does not work all the time.  I have to keep pressing it over and over, but it seems that the connection inside to laptop is bad because the power doesn't turn on, even when plugged in or fully charged.  I don't know if this is a flaw with all the hp streams, or just mine. Also there is little to no storage capacity for pictures, videos, etc.  Double check the specs to make sure this is what you want before you purchase."
2.0,"It's ok, kind of slow when compared to other tablets.  The default user interface is actually easier to use than the child interface."
2.0,It doesn't worth the money. I returned it and will by an Apple IPad air instead.
2.0,"bought this motherboard recently and it would not run the bios. after taking it to a computer repair shop they said the motherboard was faulty and that i'd need to get it replaced. I've read good reviews on this motherboard as well as a handful of bad ones claiming the same problem i'm having. i'm still optimistic that this is a quality type of motherboard, hopefully the replacement wont have the same problem."
2.0,works but overheat.  fire hazard.  no longer using.
2.0,"I brought this for school. I am taking my classes online & it ebooks are cheaper. I am attending Wilmington University & the ebooks from the bookstore uses an app that the fire is not compatible with. Long story short I feel like it was a waste. It is a nice tablet, just is not good for what I need it for"
2.0,Freezes from time to time..
2.0,"I just moved into a new three story house and didn't have the foresight to install the wireless gateway someplace in the middle of the house.  I did have the logic of wanting an ethernet connection for my television which is on the first floor.  Plagued by poor connectivity and speeds, I researched some options.  I thought powerline would be a good solution.  Since theoretically come of the bandwidth wouldn't be cannibalized by the connection the wireless gateway, which I understand to be the case with a wifi range extender.<br /><br />Setup<br />The instructions are short, but unfortunately not simple.  There were many steps that it was not clear whether it was referring to the adapter (the device that is wired to your gateway) or the extender (the device that you use to re-transmit wifi or connect devices to using ethernet).  That is certainly cause for frustration.<br /><br />Now while the basics of this unit worked, many aspects of it do not work as you might expect or as the instructions might indicate.  For example, I wanted to have the Wireless Gateway settings replicated to the Transmitter.  It purports to be an easy press of the WPS button and another press of a button on the extender.  But many failed attempts left me frustrated.  I finally addressed this issue by downloading a software client to connect to the extender and manually replicate the settings.  While this isn't a deal breaker, it was frustrating and may not be a simple task for users unfamiliar with going into a routers administrative settings.  One could simply bypass this step entirely by using the default ssid / password printed on the extender, but that has its own problems as I will explain.<br /><br />Performance<br />After getting the adapter set up and &#34;working&#34; tests and retests left me unsatisfied with the device.  Just to baseline my speeds, I ran hard wire speed tests directly into the wireless gateway, and I was averaging about 120 Mbps.  Using a tablet on wifi within 10 feet of my gateway, I was able to get speeds of about 70Mbps.<br />Using the powerline extender I tried multiple outlets and even tested performance on the same outlet as the adapter (using a hardwire connection) and couldn't push more than 20 Mbps on speed tests.  Far short of the 300Mpbs advertised as potential.  As the extender gets further away from the adapter the poorer the performance seemed to become.  In most cases, using wifi connecting to a tablet, I was running around 10Mbps.  Not horrible, but again far short of performance advertised.  And it isn't clear to me if I had 1Gbps service if the speeds would increase.  My guess is no, but unfortunately this is not anything I could test.<br /><br />So limited to relatively poor speeds, but speeds that were enough to allow me to stream content to my third floor bedroom, I might have scored this kit 3 stars.  But the setup and speed woes are additionally plagued by dropped connections.  This problem is probably the most bothersome, since disrupted online games and streaming movies<br />can be especially annoying.  I won't give it a one star because it does deliver wifi capability to where I am not otherwise able to get it, but as you can gather from the problems I discussed, I wouldn't call it a product I could recommend.eet of my gateway, I was able to get speeds of about 70Mbps.<br />Using the powerline extender I tried multiple outlets and even tested performance on the same outlet as the adapter (using a hardwire connection) and couldn't push more than 20 Mbps on speed tests.

2.0,"Might be a good router, but a LOT of compromises. First off, TP-Link relies on a special website address to help configured the router, and they let the domain name lapse! So, if you try to access http://tplinklogin.net, you'll get a domain parking page.<br />Luckily, I've configured a few routers, so I was able to access this by IP address and get started. But, if you're new to setting up routers, forget it, you won't stand a chance. To make matters worse, the TP-Link website is a dumpster fire. Just try to find PDF documentation, etc... For some reason, this website wants to open a new window on nearly every link, circular navigation, etc... its a mess."
2.0,"The offset is off by at least 3-4mm. I bought mine earlier today, had free same day shipping, used it for 2 hours to take notes, it drove me nuts, repackaged it and sent it away for a return. Definitely do not recommend this product for a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2; I also used it on my Galaxy Note 3, same deal, offset is off. It also appears very hesitant. I feel I have to press extra hard to use it. Oh - and it feels bulky. I prefer the 'toothpick&#34; that comes with the device after having had used this joke of a product."
2.0,"I liked this case at first, because it's light weight and the kindle snaps right in, it's not held in by straps. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I've had it for less than two months and there are cracks in the top of the case that are getting bigger. I've never dropped it, the only wear it gets is from being in my purse sometimes. It's still useable, but I can tell I'm going to have to get a new case soon. I wish the case were just a little more durable."
2.0,power button big problem
2.0,Heatsink too small for todays northbridges this may fit a south bridge then your graphics card won't seat. Also the rpms on the fan suck barely moves air....
2.0,I do not like this product.  Very cheaply made.  It does seem to work good if you have very small fingers and patience.  Sometimes it does not type capital letters when you have the shift key pressed.  The worst part is the mouse pad.  Very small and very unresponsive.  A lot of work need to be done to improve the mouse pad.
2.0,there is no switch to turn the mouse on or off. the dpi switch is not working.
2.0,This fan works awesomely but the build quality is so cheap mine broke the day I got it so if your careful this is a great product
2.0,this cover is not made appropriately for the nextbook. It covers the power button.
2.0,"I've had this case for only a month now and it is already starting to crack and fall apart. It looked beautiful when I first got it and I was very happy with the quality. That is until the little rubber pegs on the bottom case began falling off a week after. Basically my biggest issue with this case is the bottom half. This was for my new laptop and even with the most delicate care the bottom already has three cracks and the rubber pegs continue to fall off , eventhough I have glued them down twice. Could be so much better."
2.0,"Haven,t really gotten into working on it yet . Will review and work on it v later when in the mood for dealing.<br />With it. My H G 6 fire."
2.0,"Ordered two drives, one died on first use, sent it back.  With the second one I can hear what sounds like either the head bouncing or a bad spindle bearing every time it spins up/down.  I don't think it will last long but I use it as a tertiary backup drive so I don't really care.  However, I wouldn't trust this as a primary or even secondary drive and can't recommend it in general."
2.0,"I was going to buy this drive and now I am glad I did not.  Instead I decided to check to see exactly what drive was in it and the specs were no where to be found.  To be fair some people wont mind what seagate did, to power users well we view it as not very appealaing<br />http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=34052.0<br />for those who expect to get what they pay for the above link will be very informative."
2.0,I have only had this for a short while and already the fans do not work.  I tried various ports and different laptops just to make sure it wasn't  mine.  I will not buy this product again.
2.0,well the price was right
2.0,Fine thing
2.0,The space bar was not so great. It doesn't retract up well.
2.0,Pro's:<br />Super easy to setup. Under Windows 8+ it's just plug and play.<br /><br />Con's:<br />The range on this is a joke. I live in very small apartment (600&#62; sqft) and my wifi router sits in one corner. My desktop is in the opposite corner and I'm lucky to get even one bar.
2.0,"Honestly, barely holds charge better than my dying battery did, and it really should hold more being a 6cell. Was rather disappointed. It came quickly, though."
2.0,"A year later, and my SD cards are losing connection to the computer, freezing whatever application is trying to write with them. I've tried four different cards in this reader, all freeze up and disconnect."
2.0,"Sorry folks.  The cables/jackets are inordinately stiff compared to [more expensive] C2G equivalents.<br /><br />If your sanity and reputation depends on anything, AVOID these.  Case closed—end of discussion..."
2.0,"Not a good brand, have had too many issues with proscan. From freezing constantly, to the charging port stop charging. Cracked screen after first drop! the lists go on. You get what you pay for!"
2.0,"Fabric around zipper had a small tear which impeded the zipper from moving freely. After a week of daily use, zipper was totally non-functional. Returned."
2.0,The cover started to come apart in a week. Little duct tape and it will never fail now.
2.0,"Dead in first 90 days, this is not an expensive product and clearly mfg may have cut corners to get the lower price point. This work fine early on but subsequently started to mis-behave and now is simply dead."
2.0,"There is no support for windows 10. Which means that although the keyboard and media keys will work, you cannot program any of the G keys. Corsair told me themselves, they will not upgrade the software for this."
2.0,Case looks good but already is starting to crack and chip. It's been 2 weeks
2.0,"I recommend only using these wipes when you have some real grease or grime to get off your screen/device. I bought these to clean the back of my Galaxy S6 Edge+ before applying a back protector. It does dry quickly, but both wipes I tried left little bits of lint-like material on the phone. I found that extremely annoying. So it is my opinion that these wipes are best used as a pre-treatment for removing nasty grime, followed by a good microfiber electronics cloth after the screen dries (to remove any lint that the wipe may have left behind). For 5 bucks, 70 wipes is a pretty good value and they are handy to have nearby for your laptop/tv. The dispenser is terribly designed and too large. You'll likely have to pull a bunch out at once, manually tear off a wipe, and shove the excess back down into the canister. Definitely don't purchase if you're looking for a one step cleaning method, as they require a microfiber follow-up to remove their stupid lint. I'd rather use just a microfiber smooth cloth for removing dust or fingerprints than these."
2.0,Very easy return.  Great person to work with
2.0,"The choice between buying a Kindle e-reader versus Kindle Fire is very confusing. The book reading function is splendid, but the browser on the paperwhite e-reader is &#34;experimental&#34; and fails to load digital newspapers such as Washington Post or New York Times. This forces e-reader users who already subscribes to analog or digital versions of these papers to buy additional subscriptions from Amazon to reformat same content specially for the Kindle. I'm not going to pay for the same content twice. If I knew newspaper reading was going to be problematic, I wouldn't have bothered with the 3G version. I've now cancelled my NYT subscription and replaced it with the Kindle app, and cancelled my trial WashPost Kindle app and am content to read my Post on old-fashioned newsprint. There are no easy choices."
2.0,"First, the case.  The case is constructed well enough and it protects my iPad Air well.  I had recently had problems with another case breaking and I have always had good success with Belkin and the price was hard to beat.  The iPad fits snugly in the case and I have had no problems with the fit and use of the buttons while in the case.  The stand can fall on less than ideal stable platforms such as table.  Using it on carpet flooring for example may not be a stable enough platform to ensure that the stand will not fold in and cause the iPad to fall suddenly.  As long as you keep that in mind, it is acceptable.<br /><br />Next, the keyboard.  The keyboard feel is excellent and the keys reacted well to typing touch.  The problem that I have is that the keyboard is even smaller than the normal keyboard and the keys are not all in the traditional places.  I am not the best typist, however, not having the colon/semi-colon in the right place is very confusing.  You need to look at the keyboard setup.  It will make typing a nightmare.  I have made so many more mistakes than my usual keyboarding snafus and it is directly related to the key spacing.  Since the colon/semi-colon is right next to space bar, the comma/quotations key is also out of place for my memory typing. I typically hit &#60;enter&#62; when I want to hit the comma key and this becomes very frustrating.  I will have to get another case/keyboard because I do not want to have to make such a drastic switch from keyboard to keyboard."
2.0,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to rent a modem from WOW for $7 per month. Once I installed this, which was easy, it went offline sometimes 7 times a day when I never had trouble with the leased one. I suffered through 3 weeks of this and I gave up and sent it back for a refund. I don't know if I'll ever try to own my own modem again because this one was such a pain. Internet wouldn't stay on, speed dropped to 0.10 MBPS every day, I had technicians out twice and both agreed it was the modem. I now have a new leased modem again and internet is blazing fast again. This experience was awful and I can't recommend it to anyone unless you like reseting your modem all day every day."
2.0,"The range is mediocre, even for a 1,500 sq ft apartment, and this product only lasted one year before it stopped working properly."
2.0,"Worked at first, but then all of the sudden my PC started to spontaneously shut down.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure why. but then figured if anything plugged into USB ports on this device it would create conditions for such shut down.<br /><br />Currently sits disconnected in the case. Spontaneous Shut offs have stopped.<br /><br />I did enjoy having few more front panel USB3.0 ports and multi-card reader. Design isn't bad either.<br /><br />Probably got a defective unit. But this will have to be determined for manufacturers RMA process."
2.0,This replacement battery that was supposed to be NEW has already started failing.  I ordered it last December and it's the end of August.  I think it should last longer than 8 months.
2.0,"Still learning about it. But wanted to be able to replace my old Kindle reader but can't get the font large enough to be easy on my old eyes. The streaming of video seems very good, but I don't stream a lot of video. Nice to be able to check email. Tried to use to steam TV on Southwest flight but browser was not compatible. Ordered a cover using the Fire HD but the order did not go through. This device is less useful than I expected, would like to return it."
2.0,"I got this computer on the assumed 4 hour battery life on average use. After all they advertise 5 1/2, well try again not even 3 hours while just web browsing. Other than that the computer is great, If you don't plan on taking this computer to school or something like that you might be good. Very disappointing."
2.0,"Needed smaller connection, and the size is misleading in the ads"
2.0,Very flimsy product.
2.0,Pieces started chipping off within a month. I don't have a habit of dropping things or handling things roughly; this case had a cushy lifestyle and still cracked!
2.0,The Bluetooth portion doesn't always work and disconnects frequently.
2.0,"got this cord connected it to my computer my screen looked terrible .i had someone come over to check what was wrong he said it was the cable ,he changed it and everything worked perfectly"
2.0,I'm fed up with this device shunting the book I am reading into my archived files whenever I turn on its wireless.
2.0,"Its a nice case for a very cheap price, however, it says it fits 7 inch tablets, it was too small for mine."
2.0,It's a nice cable modem but you CANNOT update the firmware without begging your internet provider to do it. I am forced to use Time Warner so you know that's not happening with their support.<br /><br /> It has a bad wireless disconnect bug which drops the network until you reset the modem.  That's been patched in a later firmware version which may or may not be standard on this device.
2.0,"Did not work, sent back"
2.0,Stop working after a week😡
2.0,Case did not last very long after I bought it. I'm an IT guy so I didn't blame it on the case at first. I removed the HD and put it in another case and the drive worked perfect so I knew it was the case. Be careful when ordering this item.
2.0,"I bought this mouse as a multi use for my desktop and laptop. It is sleek, and ergonomic. The back and forward buttons on the side add a good deal of usability and the DPI button is a nice touch for easy sensitivity switches. However, the mouse can be unreliable and glitchy. Sometimes it doesn't pick up movement or halts when I'm sliding it. I don't know if this is a hardware or software problem but it affects my computer use and gaming. I would not recommend to anyone who enjoys gaming or anything besides internet browsing."
2.0,"Not the best choice for a college student, but the cromebook itself arrived in good condition only thing was that the Amazon box was completely torn open.... Suspicious but the laptop was in good shape."
2.0,Decent looking and fitting.  The case basically provides no drop protection.  Several keys stopped functioning after a few months. So this is essentially a temporary throw away product.  Although I had the same experience with the Zagg it replaced
2.0,"These worked great upon arrival, but after a couple (1-3) months of use, they stopped working."
2.0,Poor performance as it frequently logs double and multiple keystrokes in error.
2.0,"This product simply didn't work correctly.  If plugged into a USB 3.0 header on  mainboard, the USB port would work, but the card reader slots would not.  Even plugging in the connector with an adapter to a USB 2.0 header did not make the card slots read.  And the lights never came on.  Simply defective."
2.0,"Tried several methods, just did not work for me."
2.0,"Installed in a 2011 iMac. The drive seems to work just fine. It's outrageously noisy compared to my previous drive. Which makes me nervous about its life expectancy... It's been in for about a month now though and seems to be working fine.<br /><br />Update: Although this drive sees little use, it seems to still be working fine. I still cannot get over the noise this drive produces however. It makes my 2011 iMac sound like a 20 year old computer. For this reason I am dropping my 4 star review to 2 stars. If this were my main computer the noise would be unbearable. Fortunately most of my work is done on a laptop. If noise is an issue to you, look for a different drive. Looking back I do wish I had gone for an sshd instead."
2.0,Putting it on cracked my brand new laptop screen
2.0,"Everytime I plug in My phone to this charging cable, I always have to jiggle the cable to get it to start charging."
2.0,It said it's smudge proof well I put it to like this.  I'm tried of wiping the screen clean from my face or fingers prints. Buy a matte finish protector.
2.0,"this is not designed very well.  My hand is only in a slightly less twisted position than it was before.  You'll notice that the placement of the thumb is very low in the mouse, so it requires you still to twist your hand and wrist."
2.0,did not work. returned for refund. had to pay shipping
2.0,It didn't work!
2.0,"Bought it, loved it, worked for about 2 weeks and then one of the strips was only displaying blue LED.  Contacted customer support and they sent one ASAP, that strip too was defective.<br /><br />Would not suggest buying this based on this experience."
2.0,"I built a computer in 2013 with this as the power supply. When first starting the computer, it worked perfectly. Started to install Windows 7, and it needed to restart. Upon trying to restart it, I discover the computer will not boot without resetting the CMOS. So for the next two years, every time I needed to restart, I had to reset the CMOS. I assumed it was the motherboard's problem.<br /><br />More recently, I started getting odd crashes. No blue screen, instead every external device shuts down but the computer it'self is still on, which is a common issue with power supplies at a lower wattage than what the system needs. This is a 600W power supply that can't provide enough power for a 450W system? Plus it had been fine two years. The issue with my motherboard was most likely caused by it as well, and the motherboard is now permanently damaged.<br /><br />It's my top priority to get a better power supply so I don't continue to do more damage to my system, but I already suspect it has messed up my graphics card. I try not to shop by brand, but I've only heard bad things about Apevia PSUs, plus all of the issues I've had. I will not be getting another power supply by Apevia ever. Not only could it damage other parts of your computer but it's probably a fire hazard on top of that."
2.0,"It's basic and slow, it freezes a lot, the camera is very low quality, and think again if you assume that you will be able to download all of your favorite apps. I should have saved up for an iPad instead of jumping at an opportunity to purchase something cheaper - hence my headline. Also, the highest volume level is ridiculously low, which leaves the alarm completely useless. Oh, and there are nice advertisements to greet you almost every time you turn it on. I don't know why that bothers me so much, but it does.<br /><br />An all around disappointment."
2.0,Definitely not what i expected i can go inline and watch the same shows with out it.. Not happy
2.0,"Works good for sending audio to my stereo, but it will NOT allow you to hear phone calls through the connected speakers.  This might not be a big deal for most people, but I am on a lot of conference calls that I like to hear through a speaker system."
2.0,"Cute, but batterytakes all night to charge, and runs down quickly.  Camera is bad, don't bother using it."
2.0,"There was a broken bumper button, after waiting for delivery it was not worth my time to try to get a replacement"
2.0,Very different from Kindle and more difficult to navigate. Cannot figure out where my listing of purchased books can be found and whether I have read them completely or not.
2.0,"Item were delivered on time, which I like a lot. One thing about the product is it doesn't work at all, i got a Samsung galaxy note pro 12.2&#34;. The s mouse connected to my tablet but none of the function work. So great delivery, bad product"
2.0,one of the wire connectors does not work at all
2.0,slow internet speed
2.0,Mostly unecessary accs. that most of us have already
2.0,It cracked with negligible use. Poor quality.
2.0,Only holds a charge for an hour after two calibrations.
2.0,bad design. The power port broke within the first 2 weeks and would never charge. Acer support is useless. They want you to ship the laptop back and be without a computer for 6 weeks. That is not the world we live in anymore. They would also not provide a loaner laptop. Looking online this is a known issue.
2.0,This headphone looks great and fits even me with a larger head great. Yet it came with a blown out right speaker also the ear phones them self's feel cheap like a hollow plastic shell with tiny speakers in each side. Normally not a issue but its pretty off putting here. I am returning these ASAP and going with another brand as these are there mid-high end headphones I don't expect there to be better with other headsets from the manufacture.
2.0,"it doesnt work anymore, i used it like twice and now when i plug it into my alienware it connects, disconnects, connects, disconnects, when i plug it into work computers it doesnt even detect, basicly useless now."
2.0,Good
2.0,Battery doesn't hold a charge at all.
2.0,"Pretty good but two corners, the upper left and lower right, squick every time you touch them. It's as if the back casing is loose and it makes for a bad experience. Otherwise, great tablet."
2.0,Dead screen after a year and a half. Livescribe refuses to even discuss doing anything about it and much research proves they have no intention of fixing this widespread problem. I refuse to buy more products from a company that is ripping off customers so happily.
2.0,"This case was very easy to install, but only lasted about 2 weeks.  Now it no longer stays clipped onto the iPad because the corners are not constructed well.  I've tried many things to try to adjust or fix, but I have to invest in a different case.  The iPad is used every day and I was hoping that the case would last a little longer than this.  Although it was pricey, my Apple smart cover lasted 2.5 years."
2.0,"HERE IT IS PEOPLE:<br />Terrible CAP LOCK FEATURE, a light flickers briefly to notify you of it being on or off.<br /> (and many times you can not tell if it is on or not.)<br /><br />The keypad seem to not respond as good as it should."
2.0,good morning I need to validate the tracking number that purchased the 28de January of this year
2.0,"this product would be amazing if it didn't stop working after a month or so... had it plugged into the same wall the whole time, all the lights were still lit up and it said it was powered and up and running, it would say it was connected to my devices but stopped actually extending the internet coverage, tried numerous different devices as well, still didnt work, so i had to move my computer to be within the coverage of the original internet router. Tried to reset and redo the install process multiple times, to no avail."
2.0,don't use it to big
2.0,Didn't work.
2.0,Makes keys stiff. I suppose it will seem worth it the first time a drink is spilled...
2.0,"I have had the Asus Transformer book for six months now, and I have been disappointed.  When it is working correctly, it's great, but it just doesn't work properly all the time.  The wi-fi is a huge problem.  It is constantly dropping my internet connection.  Since it is the only device in the house that does this, I know it is the machine and not my internet or router.  Several times a day, I have to disconnect from the wi-fi and reconnect again for the internet to work. It also doesn't connect easily to a home network for printing and such.  Charging is also iffy. Sometimes when I plug it in to the charger, it will work, but then sometimes it says &#34;plugged in, not charging.&#34; When I plugged an adapter into my micro-HDMI port, the computer completely shut down and would not turn back on until the next morning.  Sometimes the touch screen just decides to stop working too, and I have to restart the computer for that.  At the time I bought this, it was the only machine of its type at this price.  I'm beginning to think I should have saved up for something better."
2.0,"If you a Windows user I recommend you to buy it work as it expected out of the box. But if a Linux user I don't recommend you, there are many of problems."
2.0,"Received it, next day got boot error &#34;2100: Detection error on HDD0 (Main HDD)&#34;.<br />Pretty scare, don't know what to do - this is well known Lenovo with SSD problem, did't find solution yet.<br />If I knew, I would better buy 7200 HDD!"
2.0,"As with my previous replacement port, this port will prevent the speakers from working.  This is caused by a short on the circuit board which makes the device think that headphones are perpetually connected.  Cutting the offending trace seemed to fix the problem for me, but having to modify the device right out of the package makes me think this is a bad copy of the OEM part.<br /><br />In the attached image, the top 2 pads are connected by a small trace.  This trace is not present on the original part."
2.0,What can one expect for the price. Get what you pay for
2.0,battery life is too short!
2.0,maybe full HD... but looks like crap
2.0,"Update:  After two weeks I unfortunately felt I should come back and reflect the frustrations (numerous) and drop it from 3 stars down to only 2. Too bad, as right out of the box it looks easily like a &#34;4 star+ machine&#34;.  But many things just don't work.<br /><br />First it was the touchpad. I'm not super-techie, but I'm not afraid to go into menus and look at settings and try to fix things. There was nothing that fixed the touchpad except restoring the computer to its factory settings (but then you are no longer able to customize the setup as I had before). When I ran a diagnostic test, Windows 10 said touchpad was working perfectly! Too bad that it has been completely frozen and useless for over a week.<br /><br />Luckily, there is an alternative in the touchscreen. It works, but there are times when it's not the right tool for the task. I will get a mouse and see if that will work, but it seems that a touchpad should last longer than two days on a new computer.<br /><br />There is no dvd/CD player, but I have two external ones.  Tried both of them--neither work.  (But, good news!  The diagnostic says they're also &#34;working perfectly&#34;). This morning one of them at least did successfully install some software (previously I had been tryinig to play movies). So that was some improvement.<br /><br />But then we have the internet. My original plan--because of the data mining and security problems with Windows 10--was to use my current computers at home (Windows 7 & 8) and take the Toshiba when I'm out sometimes using Word and the internet down at Starbucks. Well, I didn't want to download the new Word because (yes, old-fashioned and security conscious) I like to install from a disc. The current Word (a free trial is offered with this machine) only is available as a download and disables features if you don't connect with the internet every 39 days or so. (Luckily I had my old Word 2003 disc which installed fine and worked just fine for my purpose--transferring an in-progress file from one computer to the Toshiba just to do some work down at Starbucks). Anyway, the old discs do work with this laptop, if you don't want to tie yourself to MS on the internet.<br /><br />So, there is no working touchpad, it doesn't play movies on an external dvd (does load software though). And then there's the internet problem. As I say, my first thought was to avoid all the data mining, spyware etc (I disabled what I could find, but trying to troubleshoot have discovered it's actually in quite a few different places). and just use the Toshiba--which isn't saving any important personal information--at wifi hotspots like Starbucks.<br /><br />This plan didn't work because neither Starbucks nor McDonalds' wifi worked.  Nor, when I finally broke down to try it, did my home internet. The network shows up (along with many others) and says its connected but it isn't.<br /><br />Finally, two days ago, although I'd done nothing different, it asked me to log into my router and then began working. (Meanwhile, it sent a message to another computer that uses that router asking if it could make changes to it. I didn't like that, particularly as I thought I'd disabled all those &#34;contacting others&#34; features. My router doesn't need anything but the password to connect.<br /><br />Also, at some point, it worked at McDonalds.  And then it didn't.  And after it worked at home, the following morning it wouldn't work. A diagnostic test showed there was no internet access no matter what browser I tried, although the main screen said &#34;connected&#34;.The other desktop and laptops in the house are working fine with everything (and the laptops had no trouble at Starbucks or McDonalds).<br /><br />Touchpad. DVD drive. Internet access. That's a lot of things to malfunction in barely over a week of minimal use.<br /><br />****<br />Original review:<br /><br />This was a difficult product to review. I'll try to separate the Toshiba design pros and consfrom the issues with Windows 10, although of course, they are interwoven, particularly since with 128 GB RAM, this is not a computer where you can choose to install any other OS. It's a Windows 10 machine and you're pretty much stuck with it, for good and for bad.  (I will not be comparing it with the MacBooks because (1) not a fan and (2) they're about 3xs the price). This is a medium-capability, medium-to-inexpensive laptop and has strengths and weaknesses that will be of different importance/weight to different users.<br /><br />To begin with the positives. Right out of the box, it is a pretty silver laptop that is considerably lighter (at 5 lbs) than my current one. The case is sleek, less than an inch high, but if you don't have long fingernails it will be a challenge to open the lid. It lies very flat and there's no lip to pull up on.  Despite its 15.6&#34; size (measured diagonally), I got this 16&#34; Case Logic laptop case and it fits just fine and is very light. [[ASIN:B002J9HBIO Case Logic VNA-216 16-Inch Laptop Attache (Black)]]<br /><br />The picture quality is sharp and bright (1920 x1080HD) and I didn't find the screen unusually glossy at all, as a few other reviews have said they did. Personally, I was very happy to see that MS listened to some complaints about Windows 8.0 and has made the interface here far more user-friendly. Most important, they have brought back the &#34;Start&#34; button with a clear menu including Control Panel and Settings (The File Explorer is conveniently already pinned to the Task Bar). It also opens to the desktop view unless you want to enable the tablet (you can choose either one at any time either from the menu, from the little button on the left side of the laptop, or from just changing the position of the touchscreen from upright to flat. Easy.)<br /><br />I really liked the keyboard--both that it is nicely backlit and so easy to see and also that the touch is so nice. Much better &#34;feel&#34; than any of my other keyboards through the years. There is a touch screen, touch pad, and you also can use a mouse if you get one (more about these three options later).  I like that it has a lot of ports--1 for a memory/SD card; 2 for USB 3.0, 1 for USB 2.0 and an HDMI port, as well as an audio jack for headphones. This is very important for my usage and many laptops (including Macs) have very few these days.<br /><br />I have had problems with the cursor freezing, most recently when I was activating Windows (you have to go online or call them to activate; I'd chosen &#34;call&#34; and a machine reads you a long set of numbers to type in. The cursor froze mid-way and would not become unstuck no matter what I tried). Luckily, in that case, it was possible to finish by using touch screen alone.<br /><br />I think the Skullcandy speakers are good and the sound can get nice and loud if you need it to fill a room (for example, in &#34;presentation view&#34; or if watching a movie at a distance); much better than my current laptops in both quality and volume.<br /><br />Now for some of the problems:.  First, I was surprised that it has only 128 GB of memory. Now, it's true my first computer had 4MB, but...time's moved on and you expect 500GB if not 1T these days. However, I'm making allowances for this because this has an SSD hard drive which uses up a lot of memory but is so much faster. The load time is amazing now. And 128GB will probably be enough for most people's  programs and media, unless you do a lot with video or have huge software to store. (This is not a machine for serious gamers anyway.). In any case, external hard drives are so cheap that I don't think the relatively small memory here is all that bad.  And people react in a very impressed way when they hear it has a Solid State Drive, something usually reserved for much more expensive machines.<br /><br />I was -very- disappointed that it doesn't have a built in DVD/CD player, though I know that's a common omission now--compounded by everyone wanting you to store things on the Cloud. Eventually the goal is &#34;stream everything/store everything&#34; from remote servers. I know it's the way of the technology world, but I don't like it and plan to delay that in my life as long as possible.  Not only does it not have it's own DVD/CD player, but I was even more disappointed that it couldn't work with the one plug and play, less than a year old, that  I already have, even though the troubleshooting message assured me it was &#34;working perfectly&#34;.<br /><br />It says it has Media Player (although I didn't see it until I went into Settings and configured it as the default), but I have yet to get it to work. I'm going to try downloading the driver from the MS website (free) and will report back if that fixes the problem.  I had to go into settings to change the music (played off a thumb drive) default from MS's default &#34;Groove Music&#34; software to Media Player (Groove Music does work well though with MP3s, I haven't yet tried other kinds of files, but it seems the USB ports and music players have no compatibility issues).<br /><br />Now for my two biggest areas of dissatisfaction. The first is the amount of useless bloatware it comes with -- and they sit annoyingly visible on your tablet or on your desktop. Some, I was able to go in and delete. But lots of others, like Xbox Zappos, ebay and Groupon (among many others that are displayed like valued apps, but actually are just urging you to buy things online) I can't get rid of (so far). You have some options to uninstall programs and apps, but not nearly enough. There are many of them here--on the desktop, all alphabetically listed in the Startup menu--and I think that's wrong, actually. Anyone who wants them will know how to add them and where to find them. The consumer shouldn't buy a product, especially something as expensive as a computer, and be forced to look at unwanted advertisement all the time.<br /><br />The second --and for me, biggest-- problem is regarding privacy and security concerns with Windows 10. I had read a bit before the laptop arrived about how Windows 10 is constantly collecting data about you and beyond that has various settings (often that the user is unaware of unless you know to look for them) where your contacts and other information are automatically being shared with MS--and with others, your &#34;contacts, friends, family&#34; and also if people are nearby on the network you're using..<br /><br />I find this idea of forced (and imo sneaky) data mining unacceptable, even unethical.  If you feel the same way, my first advice is to NOT do an &#34;Express Set up&#34;.  Do &#34;Custom&#34;. It is easy to read through all of the choices--nothing at all complicated to do, just click &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34;. You will probably be as surprised as I was at some of the things it will do without your knowledge if you don't do this.<br /><br />For now, I am keeping this computer off of my home network until I'm sure it's working properly, as I'm not sure how it accesses other computers in your network and if any information is being collected and stored. More to the point, since some of the &#34;automatically share&#34; settings are the Windows 10 defaults, you really should go through all the &#34;Settings&#34; on your own too, even if you do a Custom setup since other things are embedded in various settings that facilitate sending information to MS and others.  Activating Windows was a slight hassle as I chose to do it via phone rather than the internet--still, appreciated having the choice. The Starbucks wifi hotspot that worked yesterday only gave &#34;limited&#34; access today and McDonald's didn't give any at all. No additional settings had been changed since yesterday, when it was working perfectly at Starbucks. And everything was working perfectly with my Windows 7 laptop which I also had with me.<br /><br />Basically, until I fully understand the limits and extent of the data Windows is collecting from my use and also from other computers &#34;in my network&#34;, as well as how it is accessed by others nearby, I'm staying off my home internet and not doing anything online with this laptop that I would worry about security-wise (banking, etc.) I don't do Facebook, but I'd read up more on Windows 10 before doing social media with it either..<br /><br />That may seem too extreme for some, but some might be interested in considering how much access you want to give Windows 10 from the beginning. (Definitely, avoiding the &#34;Express Setup&#34; is a good idea, even if you don't want to go through all the other setting choices, too). Btw, you start with a 30 day free trial of McAfee but I'll probably go back to Norton, even though it will use more storage space.  For this reason--skepticism over all the information MS wants to collect, I'm not going to be using Cortana (the Siri equivalent--a data mining dream) or One Note as I can do without the MS cloud. Also I'm not configuring it with my smartphone. YMMV on all this, but for me the (slight) added convenience of these interconnections with the laptop just isn't worth it.<br /><br />I -do- use the Amazon cloud, reluctantly, but generally feel &#34;less is more&#34; when it comes to storing your information on multiple servers. I don't plan to use the MS cloud at all (beyond Windows activation) and they have a lot of ways to get you to do it on this laptop.  I recommend that you go to &#34;Settings&#34; and check through every sub-category. There's not that much and it will give you a good feeling for the machine, what it offers and what you are free to change. It's pretty quick and easy and if I didn't know what something meant, I just didn't change or delete it.<br /><br />Given a choice between Windows 8 and 10, I'd definitely choose 10 (less the spyware and bloatware). But between Windows 7 and 10 there's no question--I much prefer Windows 7.  Oh, and if you prefer Internet Explorer to Edge you can choose easily which you want to use and switch back any time. If you want Firefox, you're on your own.<br /><br />Re battery, it took 2 hours to charge and lasted 5 hours--very very good.online on the fly. It doesn't come with much instructions--just a warranty and a double-sided, brief &#34;Quick Start&#34; guide (the &#34;On&#34; button is on the side, top right, easy to overlook, especially if you're used to having it on the top). But that's why going into settings on your own is a good idea--and choosing &#34;Custom&#34; set up.<br /><br />Oh, and I find the rotate-able screen very convenient. I know its not good to sit at the computer too long and with &#34;presentation view&#34; or &#34;tablet view&#34; I have much more flexibility to stand or move around, or take it with me when using the treadmill or if I want to look at something while cooking. Very nice, in that respect.  I could see the large, flat tabletop style being very inviting for a team that is  standing and collaborating on a project.  The text is easy to read and there are modifications in &#34;Settings&#34; to help with access for visual or auditory difficulties. It's easy to enlarge things using the touchpad (actually, it was -too- sensitive, continuing to enlarge it all after I'd enlarged it slightly. But you can decrease that sensitivity in the settings).<br /><br />All in all, this laptop is a good looking and sounding computer with many good things about it, especially in this price range. But I'd be wary about the Windows 10 philosophy of knowing everything about you and I'd recommend to at least opt out of the Express Setup and, if you use your home internet, to avoid giving it the ability to interface with your other computers and instead use a different way of identifying/naming the network to this machine (your internet provider can help with this)..ded by everyone wanting you to store things on the Cloud.

But they don't DO anything except let you map the (terribly positioned to the point where I never use them) macro keys slightly more easily; in The Witcher 2, instead of choosing that pressing G1 is the same as pressing 4, you can just tell the software sweet that G1 should cast Aard.  But the screen itself still sits there useless, either displaying the time, or your RAM usage (depending on which one you pick).  I cannot stress how infuriating it is to expect amazing things from this amazing screen (especially when there are &#34;game profiles&#34; that you ASSUME will link the screen to the game), and find it to be an utter waste of tech, money, and space.<br />Also, the menu and related keys are a static color; they will always be orange.  Looks reeeeeally odd if you have the other keys lit up in any other color.<br />I'll always be loyal to Logitech.  But I absolutely cannot recommend this keyboard to anyone."
2.0,"Looks great, but the Aukey 12 volt 2.5 amp wall adapter that comes with the 7 port USB 3 hub can't deliver enough power for my USB hard drives to mount (even the ones that have their own power). Ended up going with the all black Amazon 7 Port USB 3 Hub which has a 12 volt 3 amp laptop sized charger and that solved my USB connectivity issues I was having."
2.0,"Another of those devices where much is promised, but it doesn't deliver.  I wonder how much (if any) this device was tested to verify the &#34;198 feet&#34; claim.<br />Bought 2 of these for my company, for connecting to a data collector on a device.  No heavy data traffic, as with a webcam.  The collector merely samples temperature data every minute or so and sends it to the pc.<br />I couldn't get it to work.  The claim that it will go 198 feet is an exaggeration.  After about 50 feet the signal drops to almost nothing.  It &#34;might&#34; possibly work over longer distances if it was some very low data passing over the line."
2.0,"Not an impressive product if you're using an iPad. We thought this would be a cool addition to our tradeshow equipment. We take orders at shows and usually use two iPads, an iPad 3 and an iPad 1. So if it worked, it would've been pretty cool.<br /><br />First off, you shouldn't need to press a function key to sync it. I glanced at the instructions and didn't catch that you need to press a key combo to get it to sync. So when we got to the tradeshow (without the box that had the instructions on it) we ended up having to go online to figure out how to turn it on. Sure, we should've brought the instructions. However, for devices like this I'm a believer that they should be intuitive and not need instructions. It's a bluetooth keyboard. It's not a complex device. It should just sync. Also, theoretically opening the lid turns it on. However no light goes on to indicate that's the case. At first, I thought it had lost it's charge. There should be some sort of indicator it's charged.<br /><br />Secondly, it doesn't work with the iPad 1. There are bluetooth keyboards that do, so I know it's possible. So check the support page to make sure your device is supported. Seems like a lot of devices are not.<br /><br />Third, it's not weighted. So the 'adjustable' stand is useless if you're using an iPad. If it's at any angle but straight up, the whole thing tips over.<br /><br />The keyboard does work well. So it gets a star for that. If you were using it with two iPhone 6s, you probably wouldn't have encountered the problems I ran into and it would rate higher. However, for iPads I don't think this is a good solution. We had what should have been a perfect use case for the device (two iPads at a tradeshow) and it totally failed."
2.0,make sure you get the right size. i got a smaller one for 15.6
2.0,"These sound really good and look very sharp at night.  However, the main component went bad within a year."
2.0,"WiFi connection keeps dropping off. Everything else great, but streaming videos is the main reason I bought it, so it makes for an unsatisfactory experience when I have to keep fidgeting with the WiFi."
2.0,"Netgear needs to send the engineer who designed the case of this product back to kindergarten. As others have said, this product will block both outlets of a standard Duplex outlet, leaving the &#34;extra outlet&#34; as the only available outlet.  If the engineers at Nutgear had moved the outlet and plug on this product 1/2 inch closer to the end of the case, the other outlet in a duplex receptacle would be usable."
2.0,Headphones broke within the first 5 minutes of use. The black mesh part came off and I was unable to put it back on. Overall disappointed.
2.0,Didn't last very long - got hot and failed.  Both units did the same thing.  Won't buy this product again.
2.0,"Seems like a great product. Had top notch packaging and presentation. However, the mousepad itself is lacking value to me. I have a razer deathadder and I noticed that the mousepad interferes with the tracking. due to this I may be returning this item."
2.0,Battery life was about 1.5 hours.  Unacceptable  !!
2.0,"In looking for a hard drive, I had &#34;laptop&#34; as a filter.  This drive showed up with that filter applied.  So I ordered it.  After receiving it, it will not fit.  Which I then read buried in the description &#34;These drives are 15mm high, and will not fit into laptops/notebooks&#34;.  Well, I'm keeping it for my external enclosure, but it should not have shown up under the filter of laptop. In addition, the fact that this 2.5 drive won't fit a laptop should be in bold and at the top..."
2.0,These things are slow as hell.  I only bought them because size was more of a concern than performance and they're really quite tiny.
2.0,This tablet looks nice but doesnt work well.  My grandson has had this tablet for 2weeks and it is making clicking noises and freezes on him all the time. Games he has downloaded doesn't work and the charger has broken off in the tablet so therefore I am very disappointed with this product. Packing it up and sending it back.
2.0,I haven't had any luck getting drivers to work with any of the Macs I've tried to install this on across multiple versions of Mac OS X. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it.
2.0,Low quality sound.
2.0,It works but not very well. You kind of have to hold your mouth right. Takes a bit to get it to actually connect to my watch and I have to secure it with a rubber band. Definitely recommend finding another source.
2.0,Disappointed with cords because we have to remove devices from cases to use.<br />Always annoying with messages popping up about cord not being compatible with Apple products.<br />Would be better off to buy Apple approved products
2.0,Not great. Gets dark with usage and ends up looking dirty. Consider the other options :)
2.0,Might be good for reading email but that is about it.  Couldn't keep up with Visio drawings or mid level graphics programs.  Used it with a Mac air 2013.<br /><br />Mouse was also very laggy which was the killer for me.
2.0,"When I have used these to sync or transfer data they have worked fine.  However, I use them with a tablet that draws nearly 1A and these cables seem to carry only .5A.  Without one of these cables attached, my Samsung tablet charges.  Once attached, my tablet discharges, although a bit slower."
2.0,"owning So disappointed!  I have purchased 4 kindles HDand HDX  within the last two years.  While they are great to use, their life is very short.  My son's HD died just past the one year warranty, so Amazon's solution was to have us buy a new one.  After owning my HDX for just 22 months, I watched an episode of Downton Abbey on Amazon prime, and minutes later, my kindle showed squiggly lines then just died.  Once again, Amazon's solution was to buy a new one.  Why would I choose to pay to replace tablets with such a short shelf life?"
2.0,"Sadly, the product doesn't work for me."
2.0,Broke quickly.
2.0,"Sound coming out of this new design is unacceptably LOUD, probably because of the very thin walled hard plastic case and the loud little fan needed to cool this puppy. I had to relegate this thing to the server room – it was that loud that you really can't have this on your desk.<br />The plastic edges on this are sharp enough to cut or scrape. Disappointing, Seagate."
2.0,Not worth your time
2.0,"It cracked after 3 weeks of use. Great color, not so great quality. I had expected more from Speck."
2.0,The hand strap on the inside should been on the outside other words ok
2.0,"Have read the instructions a couple times, had an IT person come out also and it isn't working quite the way I expected. Have not gotten it to work for extending a jetpack range."
2.0,"Barely lights my full-tower case at all.  Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it does work, but offers very limited lighting."
2.0,Cheap
2.0,I brought this NAS drive with lot of excitement. I am disappointed with the performance and annoyed with the vibration it creates.<br />The transfer rate to the NAS drive is way too slow.
2.0,Not recognized by Mac without adding software.  Other USB to Ethernet adapters did not require the additional software.
2.0,Nice but really really slow
2.0,I love that the phone is big but it's alo t of things I really don't like I don't recommend this phone
2.0,"Product seemed OK at first.  The touch screen was a little wonky.  Not moving sometimes, other times it would click when I wanted to scroll.  Would overlook that for the good price.  Screen has unfriendly viewing angles where the contrast will make it unviewable.  Stopped working after a week.  If it didn't fail to work, would have been acceptable for price."
2.0,"es buen producto aunque el software al principio me presentó dificultad, y esperaba que fuese más robusto, posee componentes plásticos<br />is good product but the software initially introduced me difficulty, and expected to be more robust, has plastic components"
2.0,Bad product
2.0,Returned.  Did not fit.
2.0,"Actually only 4-ports, one is a feed! One of the ports was DOA, so actually only 3 remaining."
2.0,"Fits snugly...then falls apart. Didn't even get a chance to put the iPad in to test it before the joint that holds the swivel portion on fell off and the screw, washer, and other hardware fell all over the floor of the car."
2.0,The cable/software didn't transfer all files.
2.0,looks good but very disappointed that the bottom buds started coming off after 3 days of use... bad bad.. returning it.
2.0,"Not good for me. But still recommend for the users, who do light work."
2.0,Will not work in a Mac Pro.
2.0,This does not seem to be as fast as they advertise.  Its slower than a old 64gb card I had. It is supposed to be the new 128gb faster version.<br />On the front of the envelope it says microSDXC UHS-I up to 80MB/s I get up to 20MB/s using PC and Android<br />On the back off the envelope it says SDSQUNC-128G-GN6M<br />SD Insite says its a SL128 rev8.0 Manufactured Aug 2015. SD Physical Layer 3.0 SDXC Card Security version 3.xx<br /><br />Using my PC I only seen up to 20mb reads and 9 to 12 writes.<br /><br />Using A1 SD Bench memory card test I see 20mb reads and 9.66 writes on the long test.<br />Don't wast your money on this card. IT seems a legit Sandisk card but not even close to the advertised speed.
2.0,"I returned this receiver after one day. It was unstable and would skip and jitter every minute or two. It may be more stable if you're using it in one room apartment, but for a larger house it doesn't work. For twice the price I bought the MUZO Cobblestone Wi-Fi Audio Receiver and I HIGHLY recommend. it. Super stable and reliable."
2.0,"Item did not fit properly, and the code on the item was different then what is advertised. Besides these issues the product works and fixed the issue with my mac"
2.0,Pros:<br />- case is okay<br />Cons:<br />I've got this keyboard from massdrop and want to share my experience with community here.<br />Some buttons especially backspace were hard to press (seems like issues with stabilizers) which was very annoying cause you have to press those far away buttons with your pinky finger.<br />Light that is below space bar which indicates layer that you are on shines through plastic and it looks quite ugly.<br />Inability to program default layer sounds like a big limitation to me because if you want to modify behavior you will always see ugly light below your space bar.<br />For some reason they treat caps lock specially and you can't make it act as a control (you can only move fn key there).<br />Overall it doesn't feel like a premium keyboard. Sold mine on ebay.
2.0,rubber feet come off way too quick / easy
2.0,"This charger was great right up until it quit working less than 4 months after I received it.  Too bad, because I really liked the extra long cord.  BAck to the search bar to find a different one."
2.0,Peels of
2.0,Does not connect to the tablet
2.0,"Didn't fit my computer. This was supposed to fit my new computer and I ordered it with the model number right in front of me, so I didn't order the wrong one. Waste of money."
2.0,"After a few months my son was back on my tablet. Thus was slow, frustrating and cumbersome.  He only used it for games like Minecraft and temple run and it was not good.  Ended up buying him a kindle fire.  He loves it."
2.0,Had trouble keeping opening for camera lens lined up with opening in tablet cover
2.0,"This is not a Samsung cord like I thought it was and that was advertised! This cord is very short, I have to sit next to an outlet while using it. However it does what is intended and that's charging my laptop. Cheap price, but for $1 more I could of gotten a 25in cord"
2.0,This productt needs another part that is not included to work
2.0,"I owned a Synology NAS for two years and when I needed to buy two more I went with Synology again.  The problem is that I used the old one strictly as a NAS and kept trying to find the time to use all the neat software packages that came with a Synology NAS.  Now that I have these two brand new ones I figured I would try the Cloud Sync, DS Video, Cloud Station etc.  Wow, what a disaster.  I have been trying for several days and Cloud Sync simply will not authorize.  Cloud Station; there is not enough space to describe the problems.  DS video has been a huge disappointment.  Syncing between two Synology devices is suppose to be part of the apps but I have yet to see that work.<br />My DS Video movies do not match the ones on the Synology NAS.  During the adding of the media there was some incorrect matches which is completely understandable.  It did shock my wife when a very old Zorro serial from the '30s come up as an erotica movie.  These were fixed, re-indexed etc.  However, the mobile apps still show all the original titles.  Including the erotica movie, a bit awkward when showing the DS Video app to a co-worker.<br />Bottom line is that the Synology boxes appear to be very good network attached storage and that is all.  If that is all then they are very much over priced.  It is a shame because I was hoping for more and spent a heck of a lot to get there."
2.0,This device did not meet expectations for a wireless/wifi internet adapter. And communications with seller was subpar and unprofessional.
2.0,This is a far inferior product to my previous Kindle. There is no button on the device to press to take me back to the home screen. There is no connection for a case that comes with a built in light (and of COURSE there is no option for backlight). I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's design for the &#34;new&#34; generation Kindle. Don't buy it. Unless you honestly can afford only the cheap option. Because that's what this is. It's a cheap piece of ****.
2.0,"In the past I have had hit or miss luck with PNY brand. I had issues with their memory way back in the days of the original AMD athlon 12 years ago, got a bad stick. I owned a video card from these guys for that same computer a couple years later and it was one of my favorite video cards ever having a built in TV feature.  I have a couple flash sticks i got on sale of the years, with no problems. This came up as the value on amazon when looking at expanding my phones memory, so i took a chance on it over a coouple others, notably samsung which was 20 bucks more and the lexar 64mb high speed one i have in my wife's phone, or even a sandisk which has not been a problem for me, but is more expensive. this installed ok into the new phone and seemed to work ok. Only when i went to review pictures taken during a trip did I run into issues with viewing the pictures. I tried to get them over to a computer, and they still wouldn't open up. unfortnately, I lost pictures for a whole day of the trip. I dug around online never having this problem with the phone in the past, and it mentioned the memory card being the problems. I ended up getting a different card when we stopped at a store, and it has worked without any problems. Thus, I won't be buying PNY any time soon. I stuck this card in an older phone i have that my son uses as a tablet with a bunch of music on it (also used as a jukebox), it works ok there to salvage the item some."
2.0,"While I like the feel and &quot;performance&quot; of the mouse, I cant use it because it makes a horrible high pitched squeal when I'm using it.<br />When I narrowed it down to the mouse making the noise, I looked at the reviews here on Amazon and sure enough, other people were<br />having the same exact problem.<br />How is it that Logitech hasn't addressed this problem?"
2.0,"Too bulky, didn't like how it fit and worked so I returned it and went with a more sleek cover."
2.0,It's ok....
2.0,"I used this for my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. Worked fine for about a week or two, then it just stopped working completely. I suggest looking elsewhere if you plan on using it long term."
2.0,"It obscures the screen but doesn't really work very well for privacy, at angles from 60˚ up to 90˚ you can still see what's on the screen, not as clearly but it can be seen. On a MBP Retina it also blurs slightly the screen."
2.0,"If you want to use this mount for a laptop that will be sitting next to another screen (ex. a small laptop sitting to the side of a larger screen that is used as the primary screen), look elsewhere.<br /><br />This mount has a flawed design. Due to the flaw, the plate that the laptop rests on can never sit level (front to back).<br /><br />Also, your laptop can sit leveled (left to right) in a very limited amount of locations/positions relative to your primary screen. When you try to spin/rotate the laptop platform on a horizontal plane (X + Z axis) the defectively designed joint and mount under the laptop platform causes your laptop to dip to the left or right (depending on which way you spin the mounting platter). This causes the screen to be off-level. There is absolutely no way to compensate for this.<br /><br />If you want this mount is suitable for mounting to the back of a monitor as the defect in the joint does not affect this kind of mount. However, if you want to use the laptop platform, you are likely to have issues getting your laptop located where you want it, without the screen sitting at a wonky angle."
2.0,"Really wish I'd gone with an Android device or a different windows one.<br /><br />The screen doesn't seem to work well with Windows. Just simple web browsing was difficult at times because sites seemed to randomly give me either the mobile version of the site or the desktop. Scrolling was difficult. Almost as if the screen wasn't detecting touch properly.<br /><br />The BIGGEST issue I have with this is it's battery life. I feel like I never get to use this device because the battery is ALWAYS dead. I can charge this thing to full, just leave it sit on my desk for maybe a day or two, and when I go back to use it it won't power on because the battery is dead.<br /><br />Complete waste of money. If I'd realized there would be so many issues with it whilst I was still in the return window I would have done so in a heart beat and gotten a different device."
2.0,"Just as the title says, if you have an Aspire D255-1268, chances are you will get a blank screen with no boot up.  Honestly, the Aspire One D255 series seems to be very picky with what type of memory it will accept.  Ended up returning.  For those who also have this computer, I recommend updating your BIOS, and if your old memory card has four black chips in it like mine did, I would recommend buying [[ASIN:B008LTBM90 Crucial 2GB Single DDR3-1333 MT/s (PC3-10600) CL9 204-Pin 1.35V/1.5V SODIMM Memory For Mac CT2G3S1339M]] instead.  It worked for me."
2.0,Unfortunately this comes with no stand so it isn't as pictured. It didn't pick up my voice at all no matter what I did with the switch. A totally useless purchase for me.
2.0,"Product arrived with the wrong hardware. After reading the poor instructions, and looking for the accessory bag, I found motherboard standoffs and motherboard screws instead of bolts and nuts to affix the end brackets to the rails, and the rails to the case. Over all, i'm not impressed."
2.0,"Keyboard works great but after 8 months the letters are worn off of the keys. N, O and H are the worst. So I would suggest that if you are a casual user it's ok but I use it every day and it is failing the test of time.<br /><br />Otherwise it makes a great nightlight!"
2.0,"This cover is very beautiful, but not durable and interferes normal opening and closing of the laptop.  After having it for only a couple months, the top half of the cover is cracked and broken in two places, near where the hinge of the laptop is. I think this is because of bad design - the two halves of the cover put pressure on each other when opened.  Eventually, the thin plastic broke all the way through and the top portion of the cover was completely unusuable.<br /><br />Also, when I had the top half of the cover on my laptop, I couldn't open it more than 90 degrees.  The extra weight of the cover caused the laptop to fall completely open and I believe over time would have permanently damaged the hinge.  Ultimately it was probably a good thing that it broke so my laptop won't have any permanent damage.  On the hunt for something better!"
2.0,it did not work for me
2.0,"Not sure if it's a driver problem or what, but this wireless NIC does not hold a connection worth squat."
2.0,Cable failed
2.0,"Great mouse, I like how it fits my hands better than my previous mouse, I bought it as a replacement for my dead old mouse (Gigabyte M50)<br /><br />update november 10 :<br />mouse died!!! the red light LED died and it won't track movements now , all other function still working !!!!<br />too bad I really liked this mouse downgrading my review to 2 stars from 5"
2.0,"First let me inform you on my situation.  I did not end up using fans with this, instead going with PWM fans, but left my pump using this one (this was pretty much the only option to support the pump I decided upon, the koolance PMP-500, which requires a 32W+ controller).  The pump is set to the first node on this, and only has 3 settings: 0%, 40%, and 70%.  At anything lower than 70% the pump turns off.  So realistically this doesn't give me any functionality to adjust the power fed into the pump."
2.0,"Here is all that you need to know about this tablet.  After about two months, the charging ports will get finicky and frustrate you to no end.  I bought two for my kids and had to exchange one within two weeks because it wouldn't charge.  I should have just returned them both and been done with it as they both charge unreliably now."
2.0,"Kinda bulky, didn't close at the hinged end."
2.0,Not good quality.  Looks cheap
2.0,Not suitable for displays that require high bandwidth such as 4k@60 and 1440p@144hz. Causes flicker and won't properly drive freesync/adaptive-sync. Works great on my 1440p@60hz displays though.
2.0,"For some reason, this cord became very finicky about a month in;  I have to jam the cord in very tightly for it to work.  But it does still work."
2.0,"This tablet is a very good one but for one thing, it does not have Google Play as advertised."
2.0,Poor keyboard. Keeps typing the letter q intermittently.
2.0,This is an average product at best. I would not entrust my precious MacBook to its protection. The stand up feature is better as an idea.
2.0,"I purchased this charger in April. And today, four months later it no longer works, when I plug it in it doesn't seem to recognize my phone anymore. Before this, I bought the Amazon iPhone charger and it lasted just about as long. These chargers I use to charge the phone at night, so it might occasionally tangle up into me at night, but usually it is just sitting on my nightstand charging. I'm really quite frustrated with how poorly this has lasted, especially considering how many positive reviews this cord has, I would have hoped it would last at least six months. I guess not."
2.0,"Incredibly bulky, this case weights as much as the iPad."
2.0,"I purchased this keyboard and expected black letters and received hot pink with white letters, very disappointed"
2.0,"The leather case was &#34;beautiful&#34;, but it really doesn't offer much protection for you Palm unit."
2.0,"I was going to deploy this on a job, but realized that it's overkill and not needed, plus the power and data wire doesn't fit it really well when you try and put them all together the way you want to. It's still in the junk box."
2.0,Maybe some would like this style but I don't like it and wish I didn't buy it. The method to raise the screen is awkward. You have to slide out the silver arm until the desired level is obtained. Case seems sturdy and keyboard does respond.
2.0,VERY flimsy - might protect phone while in the holster - but if you drop it while using it there will be a high risk of the phone breaking - packed it up to return as soon as it was opened and saw how flimsy it was
2.0,"Purchased for Samsung Tab4.<br />Installed and worked perfectly.<br /><br />After just about 2 months stopped working on Tablet, shows as blank, can not read.  Tried to format, won't work.<br /><br />Tried connecting to PC and formating card on PC, error card can not be formatted."
2.0,Mine broke after 2 weeks.
2.0,Difficult to use with the screen on and the stand in the back broke after a few weeks.
2.0,Shipping took a while but disappointed that i received the wrong product..after waiting for so long
2.0,"I received the monitor today, plugged it in, it stayed on for 2 minutes and started blinking off and on. contacted Samsung tech support and held on for 45 minutes before being told to call back in the morning and speak with someone from business support. This was after she asked me questions as to find out if I was doing it correctly and leading me as if she could help. Anyway I've always brought Sony items however, I have some Samsung Tv's and have had good experiences. I hope the replacement monitor works, if not going back to One and Only Sony!"
2.0,"This product would not work with my Dell Inspiron 1440. I was excited when it arrived, but when my computer went dead again I realized it had not been charging it. I then turned the computer back on and it said I needed an authentic Dell product. Sadly, I had to return it and will be spending the extra money for a Dell charger."
2.0,Not sticking at some edges.
2.0,Looked like it was broken
2.0,The battery does not last long
2.0,I bought this item at the end of June and left it attached to my laptop. In less than 2 months the darn thing broke. The USB protective casing separated from the chip; as a result my laptop is no longer able to recognize the USB adapter.
2.0,"not sure what to say really.  It works well , but one major downfall.  When you are using it and accidently right click it sends you back to the place you were before.  Very frustrating and makes playing games on facebook nearly impossible.  Not sure if there is a way to fix it.  If so my review would change dramatically.  Otherwise, it's a wonderful mouse."
2.0,"Bought this several months back for a Toshiba Satellite L455.  It does not keep the laptop charged while in use, and gets EXTREMELY hot.  It does recharge the laptop when it is shut off.  Also, the connector does not fit tightly and pulls out very easily.  Not recommended.  I'm buying a replacement for it this evening."
2.0,"This case will NOT fit a 15.4&#34; laptop because it does NOT fit my 15&#34; laptop!  It has a built in tray which takes up too much of the room, preventing this case from stretching to fit (contrary to the description).  My other BUILT laptop case does fit snugly but it stretches plus it has pockets for the cords, mouse, etc.<br /><br />Normally, I LOVE BUILT stuff--I have a lunch bag in this pattern as well as a computer accessories pouch that are great--but this is a BIG disappointment!"
2.0,Never have figured out how to make it work!!<br /><br />Hgilbert
2.0,"Not great. Charges ok, but faulty data connection. Connects/Disconnects when cable moves slightly."
2.0,"I like the Case in that it protects my new HDX kindle and is light. It does not however fold properly to allow the Kindle to stand so you can read it &#34;hands free&#34; .This is disappointing and as it was not inexpensive, I am frustrated that  now I may have to order another cover so that I get the Kindle to stand up alone while I read it."
2.0,"At first, I loved this product.  It was stylish and served a purpose.  Hooray!  However, within a couple weeks, it stopped working so good. Sometimes the cable would have to be plugged into the phone a certain way, and that shouldn't be.  Other times, it just wouldn't work at all.  Style cannot make up for poor functionality."
2.0,was not recognized by my macbook pro after a month... not very useful when it comes to using apps like Knock (mid April 2010 macbook bro)
2.0,"I grew tired of renting my modem/router from my ISP and decided to purchase this model.  I don't have extensive knowledge of modem/routers but I knew I was looking for VDSL (required by my ISP) as well as AC and usb ports which this model has.  The hookup was easy but I had to call customer service to try and find a couple settings during the initial setup.  This is outsourced to another country (India) and when they called me back, I had already resolved the issue so I can't comment on whether they were helpful or not.  The modem/router works as intended and I've not had any issues.  I &#34;cut the cord&#34; and this streams my shows without any problems.  The signal is strong enough for my home which allows me to connect my Roku, 3 smart TV's, 2 cell phones, 2 notebook computers, 2 cell phones and 1 tablet without any problems.  I've only had it a couple weeks so I'm not sure about reliability but I'm hopeful it will stand up for many years to come.  Overall, I'm happy with the product and would have to recommend it to others looking for a reasonable alternative to renting their modem/router from their ISP.  Update:  This product was working well in the beginning and I was happy with my purchase.  Then it started to drop the internet connection but mostly it was when I was streaming a movie or tv show.  The dropouts began to increase to a point where I often get dropouts as much as every couple minutes when I'm streaming movies or music.  If I'm surfing the web, it seems to be fine most of the time.  I'm just not satisfied with the performance of this product and I know all my settings are correct because once I experience a dropout, it resets itself in about 10 seconds and works like nothing ever happened.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product and I suggest you consider a name brand router that will meet performance expectations.  I will be buying a new modem/router from a company I can trust."
2.0,Very frustrating packaging. I broke the sd card trying to open it up. If you use scissors carefully then it shouldn't be a problem.
2.0,DOes not hold a charge well.
2.0,Very little memory.
2.0,"Decent product for the price but leaves much to be desired.  To accommodate the size, not only are the keys smaller, but the ratio of where keys are in relation to each other is modified which makes it very difficult to touch type and adds a decent learning curve for somebody who is used to a normal key layout.  The mouse pad does not support dragging at all, which makes certain activities very difficult or impossible. Often while typing, pressing a key will double insert whatever character has been hit.  This fact is simply irritating and time consuming when typing normally, but entering passwords, especially into a Linux terminal, becomes a nightmare.  If you need a very small keyboard that kind of works and is inexpensive, this does the job, but not well."
2.0,All of the rubber pads that are on the bottom fell off within 2 weeks.
2.0,"I just got this. I think it would have been great if not for the dust that was attached to it before I even got it on. I cleaned my screen VERY well before attempting to put this on but the sticky side had particulates on it straight out of the box that are impossible to get off and make my screen look messy, bubbled, and just plain awful. The protector will not lay flat. It was just the right size for my screen, but ultimately, a disappointing waste of money. If you live in a place that is vaccum sealed and has absolutely no dust in the air, this might work for you. Good luck with that."
2.0,"Cheap stuff.  The older reviews here clearly aren't for the same product that I purchased since mine has no port covers and isn't waterproof.  This item is cheap plastic, has no instructions or warranty, and the stand flops around like a dog's tail when you pick up your tablet."
2.0,Stopped working after very occasional use after 9 months.  Have to buy another!
2.0,I matched my serial number up with the one that said fit but bottom pice did not fit.
2.0,"This Kinivo adapter works as advertised, working as bridge for 5G internet access. However, it does meet the specs advertised.<br />We run two laptops in the house, one 5G capable, and one that is not. With speeds up to 120mb/s on the working laptop, we purchased the Kinivo in hopes of bringing our 5G incompatible laptop up to par with our rated internet speeds. The driver download and installation was a breeze with the supplied disc, or just downloading straight from their support website. However, upon installation and employment of the Kinivo, we found that we could only get a max of about 30mb/s out of it, compared to the consistent 120mb/s rating we were getting out of the Xbox, laptop, TV's, etc. How disappointing.. Also the build quality is very disappointing, with a connection indicator that is barely visible in a dark room, and cheap plastic all around. I feel like the adapter itself could have been smaller in size as well. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Bought this product and functioned great, I unfortunately dropped it from about 2 feet; however it was in a protective case) and it cracked the screen, now touch screen does not function at all. Poor design on glass very week buyer beware!"
2.0,Case fits the iPad fine but is quite bulky and cumbersome when trying to hold the iPad and use. It is fine when watching something as it holds the iPad well but for day to day use it is not recommended. I will probably buy another case even though I have only owned this one for 3 days.
2.0,"When I first purchased my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 I so loved it.  I had access to the internet thru my AT&T account anywhere.  I had my books, movies, pictures, documents.  I even used it for work when I went on trips.  It was awesome except for not being able to use google but with all the apps available I was able to do most anything I needed anyway.  Well a little over a year (about a year and 2 or 3 months) after I bought it, therefore, no longer under warranty, I was playing a game right after taking it off the charger and after what looked like an upgrade had happened and it completely died.  There was no way of getting it to even attempt to light up.  I called customer service and they went thru everything with me (40 second hold of the button, etc)  There only suggestion was for me to buy a brand new one for a small discount or I could buy it at regular price over time.  I am sorry to say but that is not a good option.  I have been using Kindle's for years and purchased the very first Keyboard when it was &#62; $200 and that lasted longer than this which cost me ~$600.  I am not spending $600 for something that will only last me a little over a year and then again have the chance of loosing all my .pdf's etc for work.  Thank goodness for the cloud that I was able to get some of my things like my books and pictures.  I truly love my Kindles but this was a great unexpected disappointment!"
2.0,I thought these were awesome and it said it was compatible with iPhone but one of the cords doesn't charge because my device says it doesn't support the charger.
2.0,"Look this case is great, no doubt. However, I've purchased two of these and both of them have plastic that cracks and falls apart after a month or two. I'm using this on a Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. It may be specific to this model, I don't know. I'm looking for a better version as I believe this exact case is marketed under several different brand names. Basically the corners that hold the tablet it crack and eventually break off even if the case was never dropped."
2.0,"customer service is very nice, however two computers I received from them were broken. First one the screen was going out and had a shadow in the center, second one had a crashed hard drive. Both of them had all of the standard programs that come with Mac erased. Teksavers said I would have to purchase the program separately, which is incorrect. Apple reinstalls those programs for free because it is an Apple product that is supposed to come standard on the computer and not supposed to be wiped from the computer. If you do get a computer through them, I highly recommend taking it to the Apple Store to be checked."
2.0,"Had it 4 months - now the tab, left control, and alt keys (which i use profusely) have worn and need to be hit completely vertical & centered; if not the plastics rub and the keyboard action never takes places.  The other keys work fine, but it's frustrating & I'm here to buy another one of a different brand."
2.0,"it works, but very awkward to hold and use. feels cheap, buttons are stiff and LED is needlessly bright<br /><br />I would not recommend it. you get what you pay for so don't be a cheapo like I was"
2.0,"I'm quite proficient with computers and it still took me an hour to jump through all the hoops to format, register and begin transfering to this drive. I've never experienced such a complex setup.<br /><br />Also, the whole '200gb' OneDrive promo is very buried once you do register your product. It's as if they don't want you to actually use THAT part of the storage package."
2.0,"They changed the size, doesn't fit as good as the last one I ordered.  You can hardly find the power button now and have to push very hard."
2.0,It came scratched even the it says it was anti-scratch
2.0,Did not fit in my Lenovo W520 4276-3JU...
2.0,"I thought it was on my daughter's wish list so I got it for her birthday, but she said she never requested it--maybe it was an ad on the page."
2.0,Do not get me wrong this is a beautiful bag.. I do not recommend if you are thinking of purchasing for college; There is absolutely no room in this bag.
2.0,"I don't know why, but this shield seems to have a hazy vertical line down the center.  (Yes, I removed the protective film.)  I expected a glass product to be uniformly transparent with no &#34;haze&#34; to it, but am rather disappointed with this."
2.0,"Ordered 2 foot cables.  Received 3 foot cables without being contacted.  Yes they work, but my patch panel is still a mess."
2.0,Works fine for a few weeks but then it just dies.  Go elsewhere
2.0,"Loved it initially when purchased, One of the corners broke due to a very small drop. Went back to the Speck STYLEFOLIO IPAD AIR CASES that  covers the entire frame of the iPad (not just portions or corners). 2 small negatives on the Speck: 1) no sleep magnet, 2) will not support iPad at various viewing angles. The grooves are not deep enough to hold iPad in place."
2.0,Good case. Broke about 2 weeks into use but up until then
2.0,My daughter still found a way to crack her screen while in this case w the screen protector on :(
2.0,it says for macbook pro 13 in but doesn't even remotely fit
2.0,Does not last long.. Less than 2 hours even on first day of use.. Not impressed with battery life.
2.0,non quality product.
2.0,"I was copying several large files to it and noticed speed was not anywhere near claims, using a USB 3 port on my desktop. I touched the little drive and almost burned my finger on it. I did not measure the temperature, but it had to be hotter than130 degrees F to cause such an instant pain to my finger. I returned it for a refund, and I will buy a larger size (physically) unit as I do not really need such a tiny drive."
2.0,"PLEASE NOTE:  Don't make the same mistake I did.  THERE IS A DIFFERENCE between the Case for the iPad Air and iPad Air 2.  Although the Air 2 fits nicely into the Air Case, it won't work!  Note that the camera hole for the Air 2 Case is elliptical, while the Air Case camera hole is round.  So double check to make sure you are ordering the right case for the right iPad.  Save yourself a lot of grief!"
2.0,"At first I was excited and happy when I received this product. The color I wanted and the price was great considering you get the keyboard cover also. It actually fit and looked better than the $50 cover I bought at the Apple store. I was first disappointed when the unavoidable fingerprints on the top cover appeared dark, almost black; not easily cleaned. I was further disappointed in how fragile the plastic was. After only one business trip with my computer in my computer bag I noticed some cracks in the plastic;  two of the corners and at the point it locks onto the top of the lid. After my second trip one of the corners had broken off and half of the clip (locking part). My third trip and it was done. I found pieces in my bag and the lid would no longer stay attached. I carried it in a standard computer bag that I carried on my shoulder and onto the plane, placing it under the seat in front of me. I liked the keyboard cover but only during the day when the keyboard backlight wasn't on. At night I found the letters and words on the cover didn't quite line up with the actual keyboard and it made them appear fuzzy."
2.0,Please chnage the item colour Como Green to Rose Red
2.0,Coulod not use it as a &#34;TAB&#34; although it is advertised as so. It is too heavy for its size and does not interface with a lot of ordinary Apps.
2.0,"I got two of these for me and my wife. We both have macbook pro 13 mid 2012. In both cases, we can see a wrinkle on spacebar near the kuzy name. It is extremely annoying that when I move fingers on the keyboard, that wrinkle pulls the whole cover up just a little."
2.0,"The laptop was very good for its price. However, the product was shipped with a defective trackpad. The left click on the trackpad was not aligned with the rest of the trackpad and the left click stopped working intermittently. I had to return the product because of it"
2.0,Sorry to say this but new computer is slower than the 10 year old one I just replaced.  Also am unable to download Windows 10.  Very disappointing and discouraging.  I won't buy electronics online again.
2.0,The case is great but it's not the color I ordered. It came in black.
2.0,The &#34;padding strips&#34; on the sides that hold the tablet have already come off Twice.  Not very pleased with the fact that it will not hold my 8&#34; tablet securely in place without re-adjusting it repeatedly.
2.0,I don't normally post but this must be said. The OtterBox case for the iPad Mini 3 is secure but way too bulky & big. The case makes typing very overwhelming because of its size. I love the level of security but would like for that to be achieved while also making the case smaller.
2.0,"I really can't recommend this drive. It is REALLY NOISY. I couldn't count the number of DVD drives I've owned or used over the years, but what I do know, is that this is the noisiest drive I have ever used. I am going to replace it, it is so noisy. I bought an ASUS DVD drive several years ago, and it was quiet. Recently I had been using Samsung Super WriteMaster drives, but they had a high failure rate. The ASUS drive I bought years ago also failed, but since I had only tried one, and was otherwise happy with it, I decided to give ASUS another try. Unfortunately ASUS quality and engineering capability have regressed. This drive is junk."
2.0,good
2.0,It is a great concept BUT the track ball consistetly skips after a few months even when I clean it.  Over time I find that I am cleaning it every few minutes just to keep it from skipping.  Other than a nonfunctional mouse it is wounderful.
2.0,"I've had the tablet since the 15th of August and it has malfunctioned (not even 15 days have passed). On the highest level you can barely hear it. The surround sound was working fine at first. Little by little the sound kept going up and down in volume without me adjusting it. I will be returning this item. I'm disappointed, it started off as great and now it's useless without proper sound."
2.0,"Failed in a year. Heard a popping sounds today. The plastic was very soft, and deformed under the Made in China sticker. The power supply failed under light use (less than once a week.) This is a poor quality product."
2.0,"16.4&#34; in. x 11.7&#34; in. x 1.4&#34; in. is the specified size of this case. It is pretty but teribly flimsy in terms of protecting a laptop. No padding or stiffness. Because it will not hold even a thin 14 inch Thinkpad X1 Carbon laptop, I have to return it."
2.0,Bad card for HD video. Constantly stops filming..my other card does not do that.
2.0,I bought 2 of these for my wife they both broke at the swivel connection location
2.0,"I was interested in learning about Chromebooks and I am very impressed with this Toshba Chromebook. It starts in 4 secs !! and surfing the net is really fast as well. Watching movies and U Tube clips on the beautiful screen are crystal clear, the Skullcandy speaker sound is also really good for a portable device and I find myself having to turn the volume down as it is quite loud at maximum volume, which is a welcome surprise. The only issue I have is that the defaylt font size is very small for my 67 year old eyes !! I have overcome this by setting the screen resolution to 150% and now I can read my Gmail E mails, goodle searches etc with no problem I would recommend this device as a great machine at a great price from Amazon delivered to me in mid July to Sydney Australia for the equvalent of AUD 400."
2.0,"Did not come preloaded with Ubuntu - it had a mis-mash of Win XP, Open Office, etc. Not that it is hard to load Ubuntu, I just selected this system because I assumed if preloaded, I wouldn't have to muck around with finding drivers etc."
2.0,"When the battery is charged and this 3.34 A Onite charger is providing only replacement power, it stays very hot .  When it was initially charging my fully drained 65w HP 17&#34; Pavilion Laptop battery, the adapter got so hot I could not touch it. It's main redeeming feature is that it has a two prong plug so I can use it with small extension cords when traveling.  I gave it 2 stars because it gets so hot."
2.0,what i read is not as great as how it performed. was told would get 300 fps in most games but can barly stable 200fps
2.0,Only seems to work half the time and is hard to figure out what your settings need to be to get it to play sound through Bluetooth headphones. Quality of sound coming through headphones when you get it to work is not very good.
2.0,They're comfortable and my voice comes across nice and clear however the sound recently stopped coming out of one side. Prior to this problem they sounded great but unfortunately I can't use them anymore.
2.0,The hard case has broken off pieces and I do not throw my computer around but it travels in a padded computer case with me.  It has shattered in multiple different places.  Also the keyboard cover did not fit correctly so I was not able to use it.  Very disappointed with the purchase.
2.0,Cheap case and screen protector
2.0,"The sound of these speakers are okay, but they are so horribly balanced that the slightest knock sends them toppling. One of the bases of the speakers gave in and broke on me just recently and now I already have to find a replacement, even though I've only had these for a few months. Disappointing."
2.0,"At first it seems like an awesome device.  Parental controls kid friendly and safe.. but after awhile it becomes a pain in the butt. It has no micro sd support so it fills up fast, it takes forever to charge and the charger it comes with is low wattage. The 2 year worry free warranty is amazing but its just so many features that make it almost not worth buying. If I had none how limited the storage space was I would have passed on this. I suggest anyone else pass on this as well."
2.0,Received a charger different from the one pictured. It works OK but the leads/wires are shorter than the originals. Have to use an extension cord.
2.0,The fit is not great.  There are already bubbles over the space bar and both shift keys.  This is my second Kuzy and the first one was perfect.  I wore a hole in the &#34;e&#34; key over about four years.  Sorry they changed the product.
2.0,"It works, but it is WEP passphrase unfriendly and the web configuration software is a bit messed up. I've had this device for over a year and it works just fine on WPA-2 PSK, but when I tried to set it up for my WEP wifi, it insisted on either a 10 hex or 26 hex key, and wouldn't accept a 13 character password. I updated the firmware a couple of times, but never saw that anything was fixed by an update. I recommend the Edimax N300 [[ASIN:B00BZQLBG0 Edimax N300 Universal Wi-Fi Bridge for Smart TV, Blu-ray and Gaming (CV-7428nS)]]. A lot cheaper, easier and better setup, including support for 13 character WEP password."
2.0,works if it is a stand alone port however most of these multiple display port setups are side by side. this thing is so bulky I had to cut the VGA port cable head to get both to fit. This is on 4 computers....<br /><br />2 broke in half too... ... went with the pigtail style instead.
2.0,"Decal seemed really nice, but I was not sent the item shown. Slight difference is that mine came with the Nikon symbol on the camera. I didn't see this in description or in the photo. I'm a Canon girl."
2.0,"It's okay for the price. However I think it could be better. The mic picks up all extra noise. If the ear covers were on a swivel, it would be much more comfortable. I advise finding something better."
2.0,I have had this laptop for a few months and the screen is coming apart
2.0,it's was okay for just one time use since it's cheap. i would recommend this to whom needs to fix their cellphones few times.
2.0,These are good but not necessary. My son would pull them out and chew on them like gum. Save your few dollars.
2.0,"Not the best once I put my kindle inside the cover doesn't close and it's so blucky like I have to keep it open, maybe they sent me the wrong or something but this is bad"
