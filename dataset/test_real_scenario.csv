Tablet broke in the case.,1
"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience.",1
Horrible!!! Stopped working at 9 mos.. Do not buy,1
I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.,1
"I made a purchase of a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive and up to now I realize that their capacity is less than 1GB, please I require help, whether it was a mistake or damaged pen drive wine",1
"I purchase it on July 26/2015, as soon as I connect to my computer it got installed, follow all the instruction, mess with it for over an hour and finally gave up, couldn't make it work, today is Aug 30/2015, try to return it, but expiration date to return was Aug27, not happy with the product, instruction on the box can miss lead you easily, I'll be careful next time ordering anything from Amazon! not happy at all",1
Just got this today. First i noticed that it come with 2 usb ports one you have to use to plug it up so you only really get one extra. Also set up on my laptop and started running it for like 20minutes then laptop crashed. I have HP dv7. Where it vents from the corner and theres really no fan in the corner. Maybe my 17inch laptop is 2 big but the only thing i liked about it is its quiet and clips that keep your laptop in one place.,1
"The plastic that holds the iPad in place started to break after four weeks.  Surprising, because the case never got damaged, or dropped.  I would suggest people to buy something else",1
Drive is slower than SSDs purchased nearly 4 years ago.,1
"This is frustrating. I bought this sky wifi smartpen and very dissapointed because it is not working. I live in Istanbul and if I send it back to USA for a replacement, sending it is also quite a lot cost and waste of money and waste of time. I heard that the company charges $49 for a replacement and,that means this pen will cost me almost $300 rather than $200 (also adding the shipment cost) even that it is not my fault. My pen was brand new and seeing it not working after unpacking my product is very very dissapointing. Never used and it seems like I purchased a defected device, which is not working at all. No lights, no sounds, nothing... I searched internet for a solution and found out that I'm not the only one. There are many many buyers complaining about the same problem. This pen is a total dissapointment.",1
My tablet screen cracked because of the case the pen cracked it,1
Terrible product! My daughter received it as a gift and the battery keeps dying and there is no storage to speak of.  Spend a bit more and buy an iPad.,1
Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues.,1
"Absolute junk. Poor image quality. Flimsy construction. (It fell apart in my hands taking it out of the box.) The method for updating firmware is a joke. It does NOT connect with the Amcrest NVR that Foscam sells, even though Foscam tells you it does. (Amcrest tech support told me they have LOTS of problems with Foscam cameras, ESPECIALLY THE C1.) If you for some reason decide to purchase this garbage, put Foscam's tech support phone number in your speed dial-you're gonna need it.<br />AVOID-AVOID-AVOID!!!!",1
"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on.",1
I wish I had returned it. I've had wired versions of this mouse I've used for over ten years. LOVE IT. However this one never tracks correctly. I've tried gaming mouse pads and different placements of the usb connector. Nothing helps. It sucks. REALLY WISH I HAD THE CORDED VERSION. =(,1
It fractured after 1 month,1
"This thing might be OK, but unbelievably, it can not be set up to boot when power is applied.  Someone has to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time it's powered up.  This makes it useless for Kiosk work, which is a role that it would be perfect for otherwise.  I've never heard of a computer that didn't have a &#34;Boot when power applied&#34; option in the BIOS.  This is a bizarre and severe limitation.",1
I does NOT fit correctly in my phone.  Because of that it doesn't even register that it's in my phone.,1
hand worked anything I plugged it in.,1
"I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating ""media scanning"" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don't believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It's a dud. So disappointing.",1
"Loved the price  but not durable at all, back broke off in one week (normal use) didn't drop or used inappropriately.  Case fits good, and iPad is protected just missing back arm.",1
Bought hoping to use all 10 ft of the cord. All 3 have stopped working because the Lightning plug part wore out from being bent around a lot. To fragile to be used. Better luck just buyin and extension cord with a 3' charging cable if you want use it far from an outlet,1
"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card.",1
When my iPhone 6 is plugged in using this charger the phone starts randomly changing screens and does not respond correctly when I try to type on it.,1
Overheats in minutes. Lasted 3 days.,1
Dosent work for Xbox like it says it does,1
Worse reception than my Belkin n100 router I had. Returned it. Good interface but poor range,1
"It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I'm still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon's return policy was quick and painless.",1
"all 3 does't work , come with connectivity problem",1
"Worked fine for one week then one of the units got burned, ie, smell electrical burn and its LAN side did not work any more!!",2
Get what you pay for. Would be great for traveling with kids and setting up wireless in a hotel,2
Will not connect with my wi-fi even when plugged in next to it.  Then it tries to become proprietary.  I have followed the directions in trying to connect it on several occasions and the result is always the same.,2
"The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB. See &#34;http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTSE9H_us.pdf&#34; for Kingston DTSE9 product specifications and check for yourself.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.e, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.

It worked well for a couple of months and then out of the blue just stopped charging. What can I really expect though.,2
"colors not as vibrant as they appear in photo, a bit large for a true14 inch.",2
not comfortable to use and my mouse (which I ordered with the pad and was a recommendation) doesn't glide well.  I had to go back to traditional mouse pad.,2
Pretty cheap. I was rather disappointed in the quality of this item. I would rather have the access point exposed than use this. Returning.,2
"The disk is incompatible with older version of M.2 standard, because of DEVSLP and there is no warning about it. It disappeared after boot on my Lenovo y510p. I complained to ADATA, but I got a replacement instead of my money back, now I have to sell it myself.  UPDATE: I managed to run it by switching from AHCI to IDE (Compatible) mode in BIOS. I had edit registry for Windows not to crash and regenerate initramfs for Linux not to crash after that change. Also the read speed will be 1/3rd of the original, so that actually sucks.",2
it discharges too quickly,2
"This battery worked, but I had trouble getting it to stay attached to the clip (didn't seem to fit right) and the star screwdriver that came with it didn't fit.  Luckily I had a small phillips screwdriver that worked.  You may want to try another brand.  There are a couple of good videos on youtube showing how to take your Nook HD apart.  I highly recommend you review them before tackling this.  Keep the piece of tape from the old battery for reuse.  Using a guitar pick (sliding it around the cover) to separate the top works well.",2
"Looks nice...however, you need to modify 3 things for it to work properly. Being that it's $10, a) what'd you expect, b) it'd be a waste of time and money to send this thing back so I just modified it:<br /><br />1) There are 2 pins on the circuit board that are too long and are touching the case. This will cause your computer to not connect to the drive. Simple fix, bend those 2 pins down. 2) When connector plate is connected to the drive the connector plate is off center and will not close properly. Simple fix, shave one of the sides on the connector plate. 3) Since the connector plate is off centered, the screws are not aligned properly. Simple fix, widen the screw holes on the connector plate.",2
"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand.",2
"The tablet lags. Have to frequently restart. Applications get stuck. Still on Kit-kat. Updates come once a blue moon, wonder if there is a Dell dev team at all. Interface not customizeable. Bloatware not uninstallable. Camera is unusable, takes a good 3 seconds to capture a pic after click event.<br />Like the sleek design and HW solid build quality.",2
It didn't fit.,2
"They work as they are supposed to. The ear area is a little smaller around than I would prefer. I like the Turtle Beach X12 better but I guess you get what you pay for. The mic is normal quality for a headset like this, I wouldn't say it is worse than the X12s. There should be a way to clip the wire to your shirt as the volume control block is really thick and big and gets in the way.",3
The Cruzer has very large secured capacity.  The negative is the speed - takes hours to securely delete trash ... way too long for an SSD.,3
"These speakers sound OK,  They are definitely lacking a mid range on sound.  The LED's look cool, but don't really pulse unless you turn the volume really high.  Also, both speakers are on one wire so you can't put the wires through grommets on your desk without minor modification.  The overall feel is a little cheap as well.",3
"Not what i wanted or expected from RAZER, felt like cheap plastic....price tooo high!!",3
"It works ok, but for a cost to performance ratio I don't know if it was worth it. They increase on our back deck is negligible. I added this antenna as well as the version without the base so I was hoping for a bit more from the two of them.",3
"I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It's not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card.",3
Cord is shorter than original one. The adapter also gets extremely hot.,3
This product is ok I have problems with keeping charging my computor like if I move it to a certain spot it will charger but if I move it even a little it will stop charging. But it's OK it does its job sometimes there better ones out there probably,3
To heavy and not enough time to figure it out yet..will follow up,3
good,3
works well; but keeps dropping out of computer,3
none,3
The good news is that one of the tablets don't work & I got a full refund. Thanks to Paypal great customer service skills!!!!,3
"I've had this cable for about five months now, and every month I had it, it got slower and the connection got weaker. Just last night it failed and delivered a ping of 240ms and a download speed of 1.2 mbps. I thought my ISP was screwing me over but it was this cable the whole time. The months that it was functioning it out-performed my other Cat6 cables. It has CAT7 specs but poor quality control. I would steer clear and find a certified CAT7 on NewEgg or another website that doesn't just allow any brand to sell their products.",3
"This is a really nice, professional looking portfolio cover with a notepad at a great price.  BUT--there is NO protection or padding on the corners for your iPad.  I found this out the hard way.  Did not even drop it, just had it in my bag on a cold morning, put the bag down (gently--not dropped) while waiting, and the iPad was damaged on one of the outside corners--the corner of the iPad rests right on the zipper, so it's not only not padded, but on something rather hard.  So if you're putting it in a padded slot in a briefcase--GREAT, but don't expect this to really *protect* the iPad.",3
"I have a love-hate relationship with screen protectors.  I cannot help but get frustrated when installing them.  They attract dust, yet the goal is to avoid dust getting under the screen protector.  I swear that is why they always sell you more than one at a time.  The first one just collects all of the dust so that the second one has a chance.  I was very frustrated after the first one, but with the second one there was only one speck of dust and the usual air bubbles.  I was able to work out most of the bubbles right away and thought I could live with one bubble around that spec of dust.  To my surprise, all of the bubbles in the display area are gone, a few minor ones near the edges, and the bubble around the dust is so small I have to strain to find it.<br />Pros:<br />You get two so that hopefully one of them makes in on without too much dust under it<br />Does reduce glare<br />Only marginally affects tactile response of touchscreen<br />Appears to work bubbles out on its own<br /><br />Cons:<br />You'll be cursing at how much dust it attracts.<br />I'm not an expert and I can't do a side-by-side comparison, but I think there is a little loss in clarity, but I knew that going into it and I think the glare reduction is worth it (glare was a distraction for me).<br />The cloths that came with it are poor. Use others<br />Don't use the tape they provide to try to pull dust off of anything - it left adhesive marks on my screen and failed to remove the dust from the protector.<br />Don't keep pulling up the screen protector to try to remove dust, see point above<br /><br />Oh, and shipping only took like 2 weeks from China, so not bad and well ahead of the planned delivery date.",4
"Nice, fast little &#34;phablet&#34;.  The screen is bright and crisp compared to other low cost Android tablets.  I used it as an HUD display for my car and worked perfectly.",4
for my son,4
Love the look and feel of this case.  Very slim profile.  Maybe it's just new and stiff but the standing feature is a challenge for me to get positioned correctly.,4
Wonderful for kids.,4
"This is a decent laptop fan. The build quality is basically feels really flimsy and not all that great, but it looks cool and I like the blue LED accent. There's 2 rotary dials in the back, one for the top two fans, and the other for the bottom two. However, if either dial is cranked all the way, all 4 fans will turn on and light up. I prefer to run fans like this at full power, so I don't mind the wonky power dials. The fans are powered by a full sized USB cable, which is included. Bonus - there's a USB port on the back so I don't lose a port just because of these fans. They function quietly and give decent air flow. There's two feet that angle the fans and my laptop, but the angle feels far too extreme to be of use to me. I think the price is a touch too high for what it is. I was given this free in exchange for an honest review.",4
We live in a small ranch and needed the wifi to get from the furthest point.  It works.,4
I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.,4
Does its job.<br />Kinda tight until broken in but it is good.,4
"A bit expensive, but does what it should. I run two Zyxel access points off these and they work with no problems.",4
For the price gets the job done. Ended up tossing the keyboard cover- it smudges my screen.,4
Very good product at a good price and I had it in my hands in no time flat.,4
My husband bought this and said he likes it. He likes the clear window panel and fits his needs for mid size gaming tower.,4
"Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone's internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems.",4
"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!",4
good value,4
Great Product. Easy to clean and keeps my computer cool!,4
"its not 5 stars because the battery life sucks. once in a while i have problem connecting while wireless. mine is still in perfect condition after 1 whole year of use and i game a lot, but its just the connection issue and battery life issue.",4
Works just fine in my tablet,4
I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.,4
"A good quality memory for smartphones and tablets,  comes with adapter for pc too",4
Have had this for a few weeks now and it's worked perfectly so far. For the price you can't beat it!,4
"This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don't hesitate in buying this, it's a steal for the amount of storage you get.",4
"I like this screen cover, but it was impossible to get all of the bubbles out. Again, it is a great looking screen cover, you just might have to get a bit creative to get it completely smooth.",4
works good.,4
great deal,4
"perfect fit,but does not stick",4
Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven't had any data loss or other issues.,4
"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own.",4
Very quiet.<br />Moves the air nicely.,4
good,4
Very quiet and it keeps my cpu cool even under loads like gtaV,4
It took a week to get it delivered but it kit was new and worked great.,4
"Great service and quick delivery.  However the product itself, though compatible with my laptop, can only charge to 95% and does not seem to provide the same charge life as the OEM.  Suits my purposes though.",4
Nice product. Relatively easy to install although the instructions are not intuitive.  Also there it is difficult to tell direction to physically place the screen protector.  The material seems very sturdy although have only had it for 5 days.,4
fit well as others have said connector is a little bit to long but other than that pleased with product,4
What I was expecting,4
"I like this mouse it works well, but is smaller than I would have prefered",4
"Perfect for your needs if you don't require much. Holds charge well, great display, ads aren't too invasive.",4
"This is a nice keyboard, but it is extremely small and won't work as easily for people with bigger hands.",4
Good except no on /off when using the cover.,4
"Like the tablet and what it does, but its quirky and that is frustrating.  Especially concerning startup.",4
Great bag set. I get so many compliments. Few people also made a purchase. It's durable. But compact.,4
"Does what it should do. Packs a lot of features and reasonable screen quality in a very attractive price. Not very fast but hey, what do you expect for 40 bucks.",4
"Once I got less powerful batteries in the mouse, it worked great. I'd recommend buying cheap batteries (no big brand names). The mouse doesn't work with the more powerful batteries, for example, it didn't even turn on with Duracell. I like that it's small and light enough to pack in my work bag and turns off when it's collapsed.",4
"Purchased my first iPad & ordered several different cases from Amazon to decide on the one I preferred best.  I was interested in this case, but after reading the reviews was concerned it might be a little too thick & clunky.  As a result, I ordered a thin smart cover case (Khomo Dual Super Slim) and another rotating case (Fintie) that looked very similar but for considerably less money.<br />My observations:<br />Khomo Dual Slim Case -- for me this was just to thin & did not provide the added protection of the Targus or Fintie. It was a Smart Cover & did put the iPad Air to sleep. If you don't want any bulk & no features except putting your case to sleep, this may work well for you. It has over 10,000 reviews & is well rated, but it's not for me.<br /><br />Fintie 360 Rotating Case -- looks very similar from the outside but clearly did not feel or behave like the Targus rotating case. It felt a bit less heavy and the grooves that allow the tablet to sit in landscape mode were not as deep, not as many grooves, & did not feel as stable in the groove when compared to the Targus. In portrait position, both the Targus & the Fintie are less secure in position when compared to landscape mode. The Fintie  tablet seemed a bit more wobbly in Portrait position than the Targus.  I use Portrait mode mainly for Face-Time.<br /><br />Targus case -- I have used this case for 6 weeks now & am certain I made the best decision for my needs!<br />Sleep mode does not hesitate when you close the cover. I appreciate the elastic band that keeps the case closed. I use a stylus touch pen that has a clip & leash (Friendly Swede available on Amazon) & I clip the pen to the band instead of using the provided sleeve because it's quicker & easier.  I could take or leave the business card holder. I probably would prefer if this feature was omitted and one more groove added.  Since it's there, I find that a business card tends to bend when you try to insert one. My work around is to insert an oldplastic (like credit card) gift card and then put in a couple of business cards on top. It slides easier. I can also insert a small microfiber cloth in- between these cards so it's there when needed.  No difficulty in rotating, although I do steady the tablet when in Portrait mode.  The stitching seems well done, no loose threads noted inside or out.  The corners seem well protected & it's easy to access the volume & power switches as well as charging port.<br />I primarily use Landscape mode & LOVE the fact that the tablet will stay in this position securely while I tap on the keyboard or use gestures on the touch screen. It is rock steady.  For my purposes, it is neither too thick, heavy, or cumbersome.  I appreciate the extra protection for this expensive device!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this case & would certainly look to Targus for any future cases I may need to purchase.",5
"Decent price on 16 GB. Works as it should, no problems. Not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices. Maybe for transferring media to PC faster actually helps. Either way, it works great.",5
"I have been using it for over a month now, works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Excellent speed, Do recommend it.",5
"Excellent. Love the size, weight & speed. The swipe is a great bonus.  Haven't used the camera at this point, but trust it will be satisfactory. Have already recommended this Fire HDX to others.",5
This product works fast and is very reliable. The capacity is huge. I use it in my tablet and in my phone and can carry lots of pictures and videos. Highly recommended.,5
the best machine ever!,5
"It is as advertised, is in my Tab at the moment and have it about 75% full with no problems!",5
"All i can say for now since i have yet to use them is, they showed up on time very fast, as well each came wrapped in a small paper packet that is small enough to fit in your pocket. Secondly If these are the right ones i believe they will be excellent since based on the info and exp. i know from other ones i have used. I got them as gifts for other people so i have not had a chance to notice much. Hope this helped.",5
I got 2 of these for training room displays. They look good and work great.,5
"Still working...fast. It's almost a mind-fart to think we can put this much (much more now of course) storage in such a tiny little space. Come on, I remember in the 90's when a 3 Gigabyte hard disk was $300!!! That was soooo expensive even considering inflation.This card, is much, much, much faster than my first 3 GB hard drive...sad...but cool...wait....ouch, headache!",5
lots of memory and it come with the adapter that makes it easer to connect to your computer or other devices.,5
"I worried that I wouldn't like a smaller Kindle Fire, but I love it and the improvements that have been made.",5
I have always been pleased with the SanDisk products and this one is no exception. It works as advertised. I would purchase it again.,5
"it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install.",5
"I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card.",5
Love it.,5
Works like advertised!,5
I have been using this cover for nearly 2 months and until now I have no any problem. It’s thin and besides the port for charging is easy to use. Great for the cost.,5
"I needed to get more space on the SD card in  my phone, so naturally! I turned to a product I know for its quality and attention to details.  I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again.",5
good~~,5
Edit: Changed my one star review to a 5 star review. Plugable support is unreal. They sent me two new working units to replace my two units that ended up being defective. Incredible. OUTSTANDING!,5
very happy w/product would buy again,5
"As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk!",5
"I installed these on my Samsung Note 3 and S4 and have not had a single issue. Plenty of space for music, photos, videos, and apps.",5
"Works great, Plug & PlayLoads of room for whatever your needs are.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.Great card, Great price!",5
What can you say? Intel is always solid. Great cpu.,5
"As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0.",5
"Samsung Galaxy Note can't read this card, have to be format in Fat32. Just Google the small program to do the trick. Work perfect.",5
"As stated above, and not a bad price.  Bought this thing in hopes of using it with my Ztpad C93 tablet, and it works like a charm.  The card is very fast for what it is and I have not had any problems with it to date.",5
"simple, easy and effective. great adapter",5
Works well for the iPhone.,5
Bulletproof memory card!  Fast and decently priced.,5
"Purchased this item for a LePan TC970 tablet. All I can say is, &#34;Works great!&#34;Okay, and so I have to type 5 more words on this review so that I can post it.",5
"Inexpensive and works fine, almost no noise at all, I like the big and quiet fan that have, runs fine with my MSI Pc-Mate, i5 Intel, GTX 960 SSC, 1 optical drive and 3 HDD...",5
Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price.,5
"Great computer.  Pricey, but top notch.",5
"Had had this for about 6 months now and it's in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven't had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn't all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last.",5
good price for a 64gb card. purchased it to go along with the Hero3 camera. Just what I needed to complete the set,5
Solid high speed cables delivered quickly.,5
"Some people complain about SD cards:1) Not working fast enough2) Some android devices are acting slow3) Rooted phones do not boot from SD cards.This card is fast about 28 MB/s, removed all the lag from Android device. HDR video recorder have no delays between video recordings (Which usually happens with most of the cards on the market) and all android rooted phones I tried booted and worked.I really recommend this card for price and performance!Good luck and enjoy you purchase.",5
"One of the benefits of having an Android phone is being able to have external storage. I popped this in my phone, moved my apps over, and added some FLAC, movies, and more.I added a selection of movies, and then never watched them. Then I was on a flight across the Atlantic and everyone fell asleep around me, and I remembered that I had added all these HD movies! That alone justified the purchase.Do yourself a favor and add some extra storage to your phone/whatever.",5
I use this in my Canon digital SLR.  Has lots of memory and the quality of images are great.  No disappointments.,5
"With the adapter I can easily use it in my camera, tablet, desktop P.C. & &#34;Smart&#34; T.V. &#34;Es muy bueno&#34; !",5
good quality cable,5
"Works great, have this connected from my Thinkpad X1 Carbon OneLink Docking Station to an Asus 27&#34; LCD running at 2560x1440.  No issues, image quality is perfect.",5
Replaced another brand Class 10 32 GB micro SD card for my phone.  I didn't know how bad I had it before I put this in and started transferring files.  It was so much faster than my previous one. I am pleased.No issues with delivery or description.,5
I take lots of pics with my phone (Samsung 4S) and this helps free up space on my phone. I've not had any issues with it so far.,5
"Did the job!! Very nice would purchase again, and would recommend it as well.",5
"Very nice, lightweight case. Did not want a heavy case after buying the nice, lightweight Air 2 iPad. Like that it turns off the iPad just by closing the case. Also stands up nicely. Did think it on the pricey side, though.",5
great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon,5
"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase.",5
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",5
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!,5
Works great with my Surface RT tablet.  Transfers to and from are very fast.  Great price for the size and speed.,5
Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane.,5
"We have 4 of the 32GB cards in our cell phones and love them.  They offer plenty of room for pix, music, and videos and are fast to save and load from..  Someday, when I get my desired tablet PC, I will be getting another one of these for it!",5
"Do you need memory? This is 32GB of it in a MicroSDHC package. If that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like, then just get it and get on with your day. You've probably got better things, like that old episode of Gunsmoke you've been meaning to get to, or a nice walk along a cliff face. Possibly even something else. The point is that memory shopping shouldn't take you a long time. You should just do it. The amount of time it's taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase. Have a lovely mid-to-late-morning, whenever that might next occur in your vicinity. Cheers.",5
"I just received this device and put it through its paces. So far it's excellent! It is essentially the same shape as the Logitech MX 510 and Performance MX mice that I have used for years in a slightly smaller form factor. Even so, it fits my paw of a hand very comfortably. But the smaller size makes it easily stowed in a laptop bag. It uses one AA battery and a USB nano receiver which stores neatly and securely in the battery compartment when traveling. There is power button on the bottom for battery conservation when not in use. The scroll wheel is clicky, which I prefer, and there are side buttons for backward and forward paging in browsers.The sensitivity seems perfect to me but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Installation was trivial. Insert the battery, power on the mouse, insert the receiver,  and the drivers install automatically (Windows 10). It did not install any bloatware or additional crapware that must be manually disabled or uninstalled, as Logitech loves to do. Very clean and minimalistic.<br /><br />Time will tell if it stands up to moderate use or there are other warts. I worry that the battery cover compartment may be flimsy for repeated open/close to remove/store the receiver. However, so far this is flawless and the price is unbeatable. Exactly what I wanted. Recommended!",5
I have a Samsung Note 8 tablet and by adding this 64 GB SD card it saved me quite a bit as I did not have to move to 32 GB internal disk - - Simply just slipped the 64 GB into SD slot and off we go.,5
"it's very fast micro sd card i use it for my mobile and gopro camera , sandisk is the best ever",5
I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too.,5
best cast ever,5
I got this card to supplement the built in 32GB in my Galaxy Note 3.  This card provides superb internal xfer speed on the phone as well as to the PC using the Note 3's USB 3.0 port.,5
"Can't beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data.",5
Amazing how 64GB now fits on a micro card.  I added this to the ASUS Vivo Tablet to extend the memory and am very glad that I purchased it.  Working great and have always trusted ScanDisk!Great item......Great purchase!,5
Popped them In our Phones and they worked as expected.,5
Works great! Thank u! Great price too def be coming back!,5
Very happy with product,5
"Grate and fast memory, SanDisk is just top of the line.",5
"The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it's a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it's a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it!",5
I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended,5
Great case! Would recommend.,5
"Simply works, what else matters?  Why does Amazon insist on a minimum number of words?  This is a simple product that works.  That' s all that needs saying.",5
"Twice the speed of the TWC WiFi and nearly twice the distance in reception. Remember to place it in a high location, in the middle of the house will work best. I run 2 AppleTVs I watch Netflix on 3 devices and best of all, I have the lowest tier internet speed. That's how good it is.",5
"This chip replaces my previously fried out offbrand microSD.  So far it has performed flawlessly.  If it fails, I will update the review.  I have a Droid RAZR M smartphone.",5
Thanks,5
This is a wonderful case,5
"I only use the Targus stylus.  I like the feel of it, the rubber tip glides smoothly and it has a title thing at the other end so I can clip my skinny lanyard type thing to it.",5
Works good!!,5
"So far so good, this card works fine in my LG Optimus L9. Its been about 5 days, and I've added 20gb's of music on it. I will update if this card fails me in the future.",5
"Good quality. I've been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one.",5
"Works as desired. Received On Time, Perfect Packaging, Flawless.<br /><br />Only thing to note for customers, If you are having troubles, Upgrade your bios. It worked for me after upgrading my bios. No Issue with the unit itself.<br /><br />My First Purchase at Amazon, Fully Satisfied.",5
"I picked this SD card to add some more memory to my phone. This works great and transfers data quickly. If you are in the market for a new SD card, I highly advise you to buy this one.",5
"Works great in my Samsung phone. Fast Enough to not really notice it is here.Came with an app that  shows disk usage both on card and internally, as well as Drop Box. Slightly useful.===Update: 1 year later it's become completely unreadable by any device. I was about to throw it out until I noticed that the warranty on this is pretty good. Contacted SanDisk, sent the old one back, and received a new card in a week. Bugs me that it stopped working -- it went from working to completely unfunctional in about 2 days. During that time the devices were complaining about corruption every couple of times.",5
"Bought this for my Nook HD and it works perfectly without any problems.  I already used about 80% capacity with HD movies, and my Nook HD plays them flawlessly.  Very happy with the product.",5
"Plugged this little gem into my 1520 and now have a huge amount of memory for video, kindle downloads, and music.",5
"Could not be happier.  It's fast, works great, and I didn't have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I've been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product.",5
"What can I say? This card just works. I'm honestly not a fan of Sandisk since their 64GB Ultra MicroSD died on me soon after my baby was born. I lost several weeks of photos, and I was quite angry.To be fair, they did send a new one after I sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half.",5
"// , Works.",5
"As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great.",5
I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great!,5
"only can use 29g after formatted butwhat can you do, i still like it for my psp, works great fast!",5
"32 GB SD Card works well, and the price was reasonable, very happy with purchase so far! Worth a try!",5
Used this in my GoPro camera.  Works great.,5
This little SD card is pretty amazing.  It is really fast and there was no issues when installing it.  It even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular SD card.,5
"Cloned a 350GB, 7200 RPM laptop hard drive to a 1TB Seagate Hybrid SSDHD in slightly less than an hour.<br />Ran the software right from the enclosed CD.<br />I was able to seamlessly swap the new hard drive for the old afterwards and the system fired right back up.<br />This was done to upgrade the hard drive for a Dell i7 laptop running Windows 8 with 8GB of RAM.<br />Simplest and quickest cloning product I have used thus far.",5
Purchased for school district.  I haven't heard any complaints (which I would) so I can only assume that everything is okay.,5
Product as described.  Fast Shipping,5
Works great! My son loves being able to set farther than 2 ft from the outlet.,5
Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones.,5
Great deal,5
"Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference.",5
"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints.",5
It takes a few tries to figure out how to fold it correctly to stand up but it has grown on me as a light weight easy to use cover. It weighs a lot less than my old book style cover and is not so clunky when I am reading in bed.,5
The sd card works perfectly. I use a samsung galaxy s3 lte and the sd was recognized without problems. I did not need to format sd. Just plug and play.Ups sent me the shippment in 3 days. I recommend the product and the provider.,5
I am using this item to extend the Memory Capacity on the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet. Very good price with free shipping(Order &#62;$35) and it works as advertised!,5
"This  micro SD is very fast, I use it in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and I don't have any problem regarding low speed.",5
"This arrived quickly and was the actual product that was described, unlike what others committed about this item.  It works and does just what I needed it for.  Thanks.",5
Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!!,5
works fine,5
"We always come straight to Amazon for our memory card needs, and SanDisk is one of the reliable names in this category.  Lots of usable memory for minimum cost outlay so there is no downside to this product. Max out storage on your compatible devices!",5
"Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all.",5
"awesome, fits macbook air 13&#34; perfectly",5
Perfect size for all of our portable paperwork.  We keep everything in it that we'd need if we had to leave the house quickly.  It carries it all.,5
"PROS.1.-Bigest memory in a microSD card (64 GB).2.-You have to FORMAT it with a modern device, if not you'll have only 32GB. If you format it with a modern device you'll have 60GB (the 64GB is impossible, or at leats I couldn't).3.-Even if your device says ""maximum microSd memory 32GB"", this memory 64 GB card can works. I tested on Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0, Galaxy SII and SIII, Galaxy Note II (phone), Galaxy Note 10.1 (Tablet) and on all Asus Transformer. It works fast and perfectly in all of them.CONS.1.- Just the price but you already have plenty of offers. I waited patiently and finally I bought it for $49.9 (incredible!)",5
"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it",5
"Buying two of the 32GB cards is even cheaper than buying one 64GB, too. It's a really is a solid value.",5
"with games being 1-2 gb now a days this card is great for storing all my high graphic games on my note 2 and with the extsd2intsd mod it all goes to my sd card, but thinks its my internal storage which is exactly what i needed.",5
"Great product, bought it for a mini oscilloscope",5
Great network adapter. Does 5 GHZ speed and works on Windows10,5
I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.,5
Good transfer speed,5
"I am using sanDisk SD card for all my devices. Cellphone, Tablet and PC. What can I say, this product is one of the best!",5
"I had been using a 'regular' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME.",5
"All I can say is that if you need a new SD card, dodn't hesitate to buy this one.  Great deal and it works perfectly.",5
I forgot I had I a SD card in my device. It's a seamless part without hesitation. Micros are hard to remove but that is a device flaw,5
"I purchased this product to install in my Garmin GPS unit, since it was full and couldn't handle the new map updates. Easily and securely installed, this memory card promises to provide a long life to my GPS unit.",5
exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro's.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS,5
its a good Book its working fine.,5
Made well. Like looks and style,5
Works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far. I also was able to purchase it here for much less then Wal-Mart.,5
Speed of processing the photo or video to be saved is good.,5
I love this Micro SD Card. I'm glad I bought it and I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I have never gotten any errors with it so far or failures.,5
"32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time.",5
"I like the cool sound it makes when your computer starts up.  This mouse has stood the test of time, nearly 4 years after I bought it, still works flawlessly.  I like the length of the cord and the fact that it's fabric wrapped makes it really tough yet flexible.",5
"I really like these SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards.  I have several and when I see huge price drops I pick them up for phones, cameras, GPS' as well as tablets, on which I store video files for traveling.  I've never had a problem with a SanDisk.",5
"Put in the lumix camera and it works fast and great, no complaints, never had any issues, highly recommended, this brand always comes through  .",5
it was a gift for my mother in law and she said she loves it!! so win win,5
"Fast little memory card. Affordable, good quality. Will be quadrupling my storage space on my device. I never seem to have enough of these",5
This item is what it is; I've been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems.,5
Great buy and cheaper than most stores. Fits my Galaxy S3 perfect for my music and photos. Fast speed and functionality.,5
Actually was better than I had expected.  Very functional.,5
"great card, haven't had one crash yet.  for $20 you can't go wrong with the 32 gb sandisk memory card.",5
"Yes they are ugly, but these are the best fans out there. Great static pressure fans for my case",5
Great product with enough capacity and it delivers performance. I am happy with this product on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.,5
Gives me more time and memory when I'm riding with Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz and want to get some great footage,5
"I've never had a problem with Sandisk memory products (I use their &#34;ultra&#34; compact flash for my other camera), and this one is cut from the cloth. A great product with no problems... I will continue to demand Sandisk!",5
Just what I needed for more storage on my phone. Don't know why but I've always bought the SanDisk brand and always been happy with the product. I have a few of these in varying sizes.Deb,5
"works great,no problems whatsoever.thanks.",5
"Good value for the money, shipping was a little longer than I expected, but it was worth the wait considering the price.  works great with my go pro hero 3 black edition.",5
Great product at a great price - working perfectly.,5
Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly.  Price was better than anything I could find in the stores locally.,5
"What is this thing? Oh, yeah. A memory card!It does what it says and nothing else.Keep remembering things even when you forget. Like my last girlfriend!",5
great one i like it,5
"Perfect card.  I have it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and its fast.  no delay in pictures/video writing, and I think I may get a second just to keep on hand.",5
"Hard to believe that 10 years ago you would have needed a big hard drive to have this much room. I use this card in my Samsung Y Duos Smartphone and it provides more than enough room for my entire music library, a bunch of movies, and all of the apps for my phone and I still have more than 3/4 of the space left.Works perfectly and I've always had good luck with SanDisk products.",5
GREAT PRODUCT,5
I found this mouse very comfortable under my hand. This is what I was looking for at a good price..,5
The cards have had no reliability issues at their required tasks  so I did not put them under any data transfer time observations,5
Still works like a champ in my Pfsense box.,5
Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen.,5
"Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you'll like it!",5
I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly.,5
"Love this case, this is my second on I purchased for my kiddos :)",5
I've purchased 3 of the 32gb cards now. One each for my Galaxy S3 and my wife's. Also one for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The cards are super fast and there have been no problems. The one in my S3 has been in it since they came out last year no issues at all.I purchased a 16gb for our Roku2.You can't beat the quality and price.,5
great,5
Not all memory cards are the same.  Class 10 means faster transfers.  This one is even faster.  Works as promised.,5
Works great and is very fast.,5
"I have tried to copy out the files and it is an astonishingly 40MB/s  Not sure why others are getting such low speed read but it think it is the computer.  Mine is running Core i7, SSD and 16GB ram.  Probably it is why so.  Nevertheless, will see how durable is this microsd card.",5
"I always like to have reliable, high speed memory, and this is exactly what I needed for my smartphone.",5
"Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple!",5
Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user!,5
in my Samsung note 2. fast no delays. transfers data in fon and to pc immediately. Good value for a top rated card.,5
"Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps.",5
when I got my phone I didn't know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it,5
Very nice product. The memory works perfectly and it is exactly what i was waiting for. I recommend it 100%,5
Easy to setup and install. Only concern is my past history with Netgear products which use Coax. They are very sensitive to power surges. Fingers crossed they've fixed that issue. Never once had a problem with Motorola/Arris modems.,5
"Came in very handy for the trip i was taking the week that I bought it. Nice size for travelling. I honestly need to sit down and read more about how to use it, but have not done that in the 3 months I've owned it because it was very easy to charge it up and start using it without any instruction. I do find that the charge runs down very fast, much faster than on my 4 year old IPAD. But I simply just plug it into the charger each night and have no problem. The price was great , $165 , no tax no shipping, and I see that it currently is down even from that low price.",5
What else to say about this Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SD XC ? just perfect as all Sandisk cards,5
"Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Fast and dependable, no problem with viewing videos from it on the Note 10.1.  Try it you will like it!",5
"I bought this 64 GB unit for my new Samsung Galaxy S IV. I wanted the maximum size for music and the copious number of pictures i take of my kids and other things.I like the read and write speed on this card. I like the size but would have been happier with a bigger card but this is the max for my phone.Always happy with SanDisk, you will not be sorry you paid a little more.Edit: Should not have put ""they have never let me down"" in the title! 3 months in, I have been having problems with the SD card slot on my Galaxy S4. Not sure if it is the phone or the SD card moving in the slot. T-Mobile have sent me a new phone so we shall see.Edit 2: 4 Months in and I am having more problems with the same card. I received a new phone from T-Mobile and the same problem continues to occur. I have formatted the card twice and this gives a little time before the problem reoccurs. I have spoken to SanDisk and will call them again to have this card replaced. I will let you know how this goes.",5
"Good price, good quality. Put it in my phone for some extra storage, and it's held up very well since I got it.",5
"Can't comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I'll update.",5
These work great in a GoPro Hero 3+ Black.,5
Sh.. do yo hear that? No? Exactly! Great fan.,5
"Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn't have to worry about running out of space anymore.",5
"Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !...",5
"I really dont have much to say about SanDisk's cards. They work as intended, I never had a problem with them.",5
This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd's and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks' are amazing. I've bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I've had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I've had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product.,5
good with low pricethankssandisk ulttra i used it for my dash cam. and its works. i can record unto 32g but as user i regularly formatting 1or 2 times amonths to keep memory in a good conditionthanks,5
This item stopped working about a week after I got it. Not the best product,5
I have bought two of these for both computers because they are easy to install and operate without a hitch!,5
"I was surprised to see the main drive in my Dell Venue Pro 8 was almost completely consumed by the Windows OS.  I added this card to create some space for myself.  The tablet recognized it as an additional disc with 29GB available.  That gives me plenty of breathing room for what I do with the tablet, and the speed is incredible.  I am very pleased with this product, and will purchase another one when I upgrade the card in my GoPro this summer.",5
Excelent,5
Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife's cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.  Not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal - extra features or not.,5
A coffee shop must,5
"Nothing bad to say, great product, great price. Works excellently in my video camera. One won't go wrong with this card.",5
Utilizing for my GOPRO Hero3 Black....no issues at all filming and transferring to my computer.  Good transfer rate and glad I got the 64GB for all the filming / photos done.,5
Got here fast and it worked,5
"I have no issues with this card. It works great and now I have a ton of storage space for music and what not. Bit overkill, but that's how I like it.",5
"I've only had it for about a week but so far I love it, it's small and I am able to put it on a lanyard or any keychain - this i exactly what I was looking for. For the price the amount of space it can hold is unbelievable, I recommend this product to all those looking for a cheap, small USB.",5
"Added space for movies, games, books, pictures, and music. Also great to relive the carrier's stock S4 for space. All major US carriers only supported the 16GB version of the S4",5
Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I've always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone.,5
Love my Kindle.  It is so small and so easy to carry in my purse.  Holds a charge for days.  Highly recommend this item.,5
"This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don't think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it.",5
"Works great. Adapter makes it easy to load music, ebooks, pictures and movies onto card for use on a phone or tablet.",5
Data in and data out seems to be nice and fast. It was a quick ship. If I needed more I would order the SanDisk.,5
Used this card in my Galaxy S3 and have had no problems.  Tons-o-room for what ever you want and more.,5
Formated to FAT32 using Easy Partition Home Edition (free on the web) and it works on both my Samsung Galaxy S ii phone and Asus TF101 tabletAm gonna buy another one so each can have one,5
"Fast computer for my cnc, works great.",5
"This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I'm very happy with this purchase.",5
Wonderful card and performs fast and efficient. I use it with my Samsung Galaxie S3 with no problems. Love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of SanDisk,5
works as advertised. Using this with Q10 which supports only 32gb. So far no issues. totally happy with the purchase.,5
Correctly priced. I bought it to use with my surface pro. Works great out of the box and transfer speeds are excellent.,5
doesn't seems to be some chinese crap... looks like it's the original one... works fine with my galaxy s4 and also with my tablet... 100% recommended...,5
Used this in my S4 and in my new S5. Transfer speed is good and it is still performing well after almost a year. I haven't been disappointed with a SanDisk product yet.,5
Great,5
"Works well with the tablet and htc phone, it doesn't need to do formatting. The devices recognized immediately with no problem. Recommended!",5
"This is the card that solved the problem with three dash cams that would not operate properly, the problem was the cheap wrong type SD Card, use this card and it works!!!",5
"I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don't need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn't work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format.",5
"Using this in a contout gps camera,  don't waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with.",5
"The read/write speeds are fantastic. Works great in my Galaxy Note 2. I absolutely love the space, it was worth every single penny.",5
Worked as promised.  Arrived overnight as required for scheduled presentation.,5
"As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK!? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos! I'd say, that if your phone accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer!",5
I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items.,5
Fits my Galaxy SIII and gives me lots of storage :] Should be just the thing that I was looking for,5
"SanDisk is all I use. These are the backup microSDXCs for my two pro Canon cameras. They always work, never had one fail, and will store thousands of JPEGS on this card. I shoot in RAW on my CF card but simultaneously have a JPEG backup onto this card. I've never filled one even though I shoot thousands of photos on photo shoots.",5
The recent map update on my Garmin GPS ran it out of memory.  Maps are getting more and more detailed.  I used this to up the memory and got back to the Full North America Map. It cam with the adapter to fit my PC SD slot too.,5
I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last!,5
"So far so good. I use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly. No issue as of yet. Overall, I'm happy with this product.",5
"What can I say, So far it came in and works. Can't complain till it fails, so only time will tell...",5
it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.,5
This memory card works in both my Nook and my Canon camera.  I chose this disk because it will hold lots of pictures.  It was shipped earlier than expected.,5
"Brilliant design and excellent value for money, perfect for the job - very pleased.",5
I have been looking for a 64GB memory card and I found one at our local electronics store but it was over $100.  I logged onto Amazon.com and found this at a great price.  Why pay more when you can come to Amazon and get it for less.,5
Love it fits perfectly.,5
"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]",5
"I have rip music from SACD and DSD to put on this microSD and it can playback smoothly on FiioX3 Digital Audio player, no matter how big the file is.",5
I have a Vostro 1540 this is a perfect fit.  My old battery was dying which was causing overheating and random shutdowns (when the computer got to hot).  This new battery fix both of those issues.  The battery has the Dell logo and a made in china sticker much better then getting the same battery from Dell for 4 times the cost.,5
This product is perfect for what I needed it for. Providing a ton of memory in my Samsung Note 10.1 in a small package.,5
Love at a great $!!!,5
"This is an amazing memory chip card. At less than half the size of a regular postage stamp, this card fits my Garmin GPS and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing. AND, it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my PC with one of the many multi-card readers. 32 Gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.",5
I am pleased with my purchase.,5
I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC.,5
"This is my second order of this exact battery. The first one lasted me for 2.5 years before swelling up, which is exactly what my genuine apple battery did after a couple of years anyway, so that seems to be an apple defect that we all have to live with.<br /><br />This works great, fits great and the color matches the aluminum on my macbook pro perfectly. And considering that apple doesn't manufacture these anymore, this is a GREAT investment. And i's under $30.",5
got for my Cell Phone and this card works nice and fast on my cell phone as well as on my pc to load it.,5
Easy to install and works perfectly.,5
Works great to store my pics and videos!,5
Great price for a great product works great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4 why anyone [pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me! Keep up the good work Amazon love you guys!!,5
"My hubby is now complete and very happy that he has ths for his Go Pro. Haven't tested it out yet, but we will soon.",5
"Works exactly as you would expect it to. Sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality, highly recommended.",5
"The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to.",5
Bought this to go with my Samsung Galaxy S III. It is class 10 which means it is fast. Works well.,5
"With the smaller electronics we finally are able to save on a card, it has an adapter so it will fit in the larger bays.  There is a lot of storage in such a small space.  I have been looking for the small cards to fit in my pad.",5
I shopped several other places for a good deal on a quality memory card and found it at amazon once again,5
My local electronics store had no inventory for memory in Micro-SDHC format. Amazon fixed that problem.This came in quickly and was a breeze to install. It saved me $15 - and that was an added bonus.Now I can download all my music to my cell phone.Problem solved.,5
love this item....would recommend,5
Use this charger everyday. Love it.  I need to look for a longer one.,5
Is there any more I can say? No! I get it less than 30 bucks! You can use it in your cellphone or whatever support it.,5
Use it every day.,5
"Easy to install, works perfectly.",5
"Plenty of extra storage can load a lot of movies in high definition, music and a boat load of other stuff.",5
Got here within a couple of days of ordering.  Easy to install and works great.  I wanted extra storage and this was right size for me.,5
"as described. took 3 weeks to arrive from china but its the real thing, same as picture. Speeds are good, 30mb/s read, 10mb/s write.",5
Perfect fit for my Ipad 1st generation.,5
Device works exactly as expected.  Holds a lot of music videos.  Would recomment to anyone.  Great product!  What else can I say!,5
I almost got myself a 16GB but decided on the 32GB last minute.  I'm so glad I did - I filled up my Hero3 White edition with over 20k time-lapse images and a few hours of HD footage.  These things are solid and reliable.  I filled it up over a 6 day period doing some work in Haiti.,5
Works perfectly. I can take the microSDHC from my Galaxy Player and use the adaptor to plug it into my iMac with no problem at all.,5
"I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another.",5
"boost the mp3 player size thanks, more more if you have the music or video's can not go wrong with more memory",5
"Needed a cable to finish a video install in a hurry, fast shipping made it all come together great",5
Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.,5
Got a Samsung Galaxy note 2 7.0 I'm gonna use for a CarPC and found that you could install a 64gb microSD. Tried this one and it worked flawlessly. Pretty zippy too for a tablet (ugh....tablets read/write is stupid slow but just good enough for media I suppose)Plugged this thing right in and used the tablet to format it. Got 60gb out of it. Good good.,5
I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.,5
The SanDisk memory card is awesome. I usually only buy SanDisk products because they are very reliable. Very good quality.,5
As to be expected this SanDisk works as advertised in my Garmin 850 GPS. I am satisfied with this product.,5
Lots of compliments on this case,5
Best case ever for a toddler,5
"So far so good. I've never noticed a difference in memory cards, I'm just very glad to have extra memory!",5
Great replacement for my internal adapter that drops and doesn't even connect at times.,5
I use this memory card with my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Camera. I have had no issues recording 1080p video with this memory card. It provides sufficient write speeds. I bought the 16gb version. I wish I would have bought the 32gb version as 1080p videos become large files quite fast.,5
perfect,5
"The desk is great and works as advertised.<br />Suggestion for improvement: The edge of the legs should have a non-skid/non-slide surface. If you place the stand on a smooth table top, it keeps moving due to your pressure on the keyboard. The movement is very slow (the stand moves about an inch during 3-4 hours of working). A small rubbery sheath on the legs would make it much better.",5
Great little card. Will allow 1080p recording on my note 3 phone. Frustration free packaging is genius. Make sure your device supports the high capacity card before ordering.,5
This is the lowest priced 64 gb card I could find and it works great in my HERO go pro camera,5
"I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That's 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I'd throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I'd post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn't make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you're rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card.",5
"Great price for the chip, fastest speed on the market, and fast service good job. 16gb is a great amount of storage for the price, even better than 32 or 64gb, great for cameras, phones, tablets, etc.",5
Works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.Put the memory cards in and go to storage in the settings.  Click format card and off you go.I have not measured read or write speed but i can tell you i can copy over 1Gb video file in just a few seconds.,5
"great mouse, great price. I own this, as well as several friends and co-workers.  It's small, and performs perfectly. The small USB receiver is small enough that it can be left in all the time if you want.",5
Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues!,5
Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music.,5
"How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It's great.",5
"I haven't done much to speed test this device, but it does everything I ask it to and the price was right.",5
It arrived on time as schedule. It was purchased on black Friday sale so the price was much cheaper than current listing price. I am now regretting not going with the 64GB as recommended by my coworker.  I purchased it for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone.,5
"stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues.",5
excelent,5
"Worked out great, met all expectations",5
Was exactly what my son wanted and was delivery very quickly! Very happy with the product!,5
"Love it, use it to store videos and photos on a Galaxy S3. Good stuff no problems yet like with my bootleg Transcend card.",5
Good value for product. I wanted 64 GB to put all my music on my phone.  Easily transferred from from hard disk to microSD via USB cable.,5
