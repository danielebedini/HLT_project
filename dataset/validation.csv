4.0,Cords don't last very long. Disappointment
1.0,"BEWARE ALL THE FAKE REVIEWS, Look at all the accounts of people who left reviews on aughust 29th, they all have nothing but copy and pasted 5 star reviews on the sellers items to raise the star rating<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE"
3.0,Worked great nice buy
1.0,Did not work for connecting a Lenovo Carbon X1 to a Seiki 39&#34; 4K display. After setting custom resolutions with the correct timing option (I had to use CVT-RB) it would connect and display at 4K but the signal would cut out about every 2 minutes. Super frustrating and disappointing. Had to return it.
4.0,"Works fine, but came unglued because the fit of the cover is so tight."
5.0,So nice to have my older Mac desktop humming again. No problems at all with the product.
2.0,"Overall a very nice budget gaming mouse but with one glaring problem: it randomly disconnects itself from my computer. It remains physically attached to the USB port, but I hear the Windows disconnect sound and it stops working until unplugged and plugged in again. This happens on multiple USB ports and even in a USB hub. Shame because I liked it when it worked, but it had to be returned as defective."
2.0,Was a great case until I took my tablet out of the case and noticed the the color from the case stained the back of my white tablet. Not happy at all about this.
4.0,I was very happy to receive my new Fire HD6 especially after realizing that there is so much you can do with it.  I would definitely recommend to my friends and family.  So glad I decided to order from Amazon.  They always seem to surpass my expectations as well when it comes to delivery.
1.0,"It didn't work at all. I tried to return it, but it has been over 30 days. My husband tried to have others see if they could use it or if it was just his computer. No laptop, phone, or desktop worked. It was complete trash and I want my money back."
5.0,"No issues so far, stores a lot of video.  Not too expensive and no issues with quality or speed.  Works fine with my gopro camera.  Highly recommend."
4.0,Dont like cause it crashes very fast
1.0,"Worked for 1 hour, then 4 hrs on phone with Linksys tech support to no avail.  Its going right back to the Target.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm a network professional, been working on networking equipment for 15 yrs.  I have an old dual band N router that I wanted to replace to take advantage of AC speeds at 5GHz.  So my research led me to buy this thing especially since it was rated as having the best range.  I own a 3 story home and my network equipment is in the lower level and I needed something that had good signal up to the 3rd floor, and this Linksys did for about and hour, then all hell broke loose.<br /><br />An hour after setting up my netowrk, I went to check my email on my iPhone and realized I had no internet connection, so I headed downstairs where my laptop and desktop are.  I checked both of those and the internet connection was down on them to so I realized it wasn't an isolated problem.  I was able to get from my devices to the router, but not through it to my broadband cable modem.<br /><br />It wasnt my broadband connection because plugging my laptop directly to the modem worked.<br /><br />After hours on the phone with tech support, with reinstalling firmware, and countless reboots, we were never able to get it working again and even the Linksys tech support guy was running out of things to try.  Finally, it was determined this thing is just wacked.  It will connect intermittently but 5 seconds later, its down again.  Now I spend $230.00 at Target for this thing and luckily their return policy is good.  So I'm taking it right back to them tomorrow.<br /><br />I'm done with Linksys!  Ive wasted about 5 or 6 hours of my life on this.  When I spend this kind of money on a Router, I expect it to last more than an hour."
3.0,"I got this drive for christmas in 2014, and now on September 30th, it failed. I used it to store huge files from my gopros and when I record gaming videos. It has been through alot being used about 8 hours a day. I did drop it once so that probably contributed to it failing."
5.0,"i am not always giving out good comment. But this is perfect, you know , perfect!maybe because of the size... no mistake will happen."
4.0,this mouse was a huge step up from my 10 year old Logitech mouse....its super fast and sensitive but the setting are customizable through the software it provides you with. you can also change the sensitivity by clicking the 2 buttons below the scroll wheel. if you don't like the green you can always just turn it off. this is probably a standard size mouse its not small but its not huge.. overall its a good mouse
2.0,"A couple of weeks after installing the battery into my laptop it would loose all charge and the computer would shut off after minutes of taking it off the charger.  I cannot use my laptop without being plugged in.  I would have returned it but I did not install the battery and discover this issue until it was too late.  The fit was perfect and the price was reasonable, I will probably try another because this one was obviously defective and it was my fault that I couldn't return it."
2.0,"It gets two stars for quality.<br /><br />This is the third razer headset I have owned that went bad before the two year mark. The first razer headset I owned had the microphone die on me. Second one broke apart. This one developed a short and eventually stopped working altogether.<br /><br />Apart from that, the first thing I noticed about it is how horribly uncomfortable it was. The cups are too small for my ears or virtually any adult's ears. But it's something I got used to and wasn't a big deal after a short while. There was a bigger problem, as I know there are reviews her also stating, that there are no physical controls. If you want to mute the microphone, you have to go through the razer software. That would be fine, since I rarely have a need to mute my microphone, except that occasionally it would mute itself for no particular reason, forcing me to open up the software, locate the headset in it (I always tried to move the headset to the first position, but for some reason my mouse would always reclaim the first position and I'd have to click the Kraken tab), then find the microphone settings and unmute it. If you do buy this headset, be sure to keep an eye on the microphone to make sure it's actually glowing before you start trying to talk to anyone.<br /><br />I am absolutely sick of Razer. Their mice are fantastic, but their headsets are trash before the two year mark, no matter how well you take care of them."
1.0,"Installed it on a USB 3.0 port at the back of my PC, but it kept disconnecting my USB drives and corrupt file transfers. The speed is also not that fast, (but definitely more than USB 2.0)"
1.0,Failed. DOA. Still haven't gotten the refund.
3.0,"Nice size, nice display. A little slower than I had expected. Love reading books on it."
5.0,This is great. It gives me a lot of extra storage space for my phone. It just worked out of the box. Perfect.
1.0,"I would give a minus rating if it were possible. I used it in my cell phone, and it soon became unreadable by the phone or PC. I don't know the tech term, but it could be exactly as the other poster warned of, unfortunately for me this post wasn't here when I bought mine. Time to attempt a refund. I will go with a higher priced BRAND name this time. I don't need to tell you what I lost in just pictures alone!"
3.0,Be nice if it worked with my USB 2.0 mouse to a USB 2.0 port.
3.0,"It's nice, and the case is durable, and my 4 year old absolutely loves it.  It's really all fun and games, until the storage is full... Constantly!  And a pain to delete pictures. My 4 year old has tons of apps that he can screen shot and fill up allllll of the memory in no time. Deleting them takes forever. We have had this for 8 months. For the first time last week I had to restore it to factory settings, which was a huge pain.  I had to do this because you need wifi to delete things out of storage apparently, and the when I tried to hook to wifi it said I did not have enough storage to connect... ????  Still a great value for the price and he loves the free play, but not very parent friendly."
4.0,No problems I have two and I bought one for a family member. She loves it. I need four more words. I will keep buying it.
1.0,"The product never worked, the battery cover was so wimpy it broke putting it back on. Threw it in the trash!"
4.0,As always a reliable and taken for granted product!
2.0,"I have only had this product for two week. At first I really liked it. I downloaded the kindle reading app - which works great. I have had some problems with Windows where it kicks me out of the Network and I can't use anything on the device. Twice today I have hit the power button to &#34;wake up&#34; the device, which then prompts me to put in my password. Once I do that, the little icon spins and spins and spins and spins and it says &#34;Locked&#34; and &#34;Welcome&#34; at the same time. I cannot get the tablet to do anything for at least 20 minutes where it then seems to reset and require the password again.<br />Another issue I have found is there are tiny scratches on my screen. First I thought they were smudge marks but then have realized that the keys on the keyboard are scratching the screen when it is closed. I find this ridiculous since it is designed to be closed that way.<br />I am writing this review because I was promised a &#34;No Hassle Return&#34; if I did. Yes this product wasn't that expensive, but it is too much to give me this many problem. I plan on returning it - and also the extra case and screen protectors I ordered after I found the scratches."
1.0,my screen is jumping from it
1.0,Its Ass
3.0,"I wanted an inexpensive cover for this tablet, and this one fits that need well.  This cover is very reasonably priced and the design is good - very functional.  Material quality is decent - it will probably hold up pretty well - and build-quality (stitching and cuts) are quite nice for the price.  The material is not extremely soft.  It feels a little cheap, but then it IS a very inexpensive cover - so I won't deduct a star for that.  My only deduction is because it isn't available in a tan or brown color.  Also, my cover was shipped in a thin, soft mailer and was deformed (bowed), with bent corners when it arrived.  I believe this will be okay with time, as the case was not actually damaged (otherwise I would have filed a claim).  It will just take time to regain its original, flat shape.  For the vendor, I would just suggest shipping these in a more rigid container.  Overall, this case is a good value and it fits the tablet very well."
5.0,Lots of storage space for my phone lets me have lots of music and roms.  Can't live without this card.
1.0,The battery was suppose to do an authentic HP battery. But it did not lock into place and kept falling out of the computer. So it was not worth my purchase
4.0,Good
3.0,The sticker started to peel of on one corner and its lost its stick. But just be careful putting it on thats all. I'll probably just tape it down.
2.0,The drive is fast and has lots of space.  The problem is the drive is LOUD!  If you are planning to use this drive in a computer that you sit beside then go with a different model.  Since Seagate and Western Digital no longer put acoustic management in their drives (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_acoustic_management) this may be a reason to go to an SSD despite the cost.
3.0,"Works as a keyboard. Nothing fancy, no problems, but also not exceedingly nice as far as build quality is concerned.<br /><br />Works if you need a backup. Would not recommend as primary keyboard."
1.0,Now unable to take pictures as it not a proper fit!
5.0,Great. Delivered before expected date.
5.0,"When you tablet does not come with a memory card and you want to play music or videos, this should do the trick."
2.0,"Doesnt have the right about of drive and slow, and graphic card isnt that good"
4.0,I have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren't ideal. I bought a 16gb galaxy s 3 and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the 32gb Microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when I didn't do anything.
3.0,I bought this for my husband
4.0,Very Stylish and extremely durable/ portable
1.0,Dust stuck on the screen protector and created lots of bubbles on the screen.
3.0,Products OK
5.0,"When you buy a Micro SD card and you get a class 4, your apps will run slow and your camera will be slow. Spend the money on a class 10 for the speed of the card to ensure your device works up to its full potential. Listen to me, I am a certified Geek."
4.0,"Works fine, doesn't pop off, sleeps Nexus 7 when closed every time, stand position not that useful, doesn't hold well; easy access to volume, power buttons, headphone and and USB jack. Like it."
1.0,The clip used to mount on laptop came apart when  trying to mount to laptop the first time.
4.0,like it
2.0,The card works until your computer goes into sleep mode or you restart your computer.  Each time the drivers are lost and the computer thinks its a new card in your PCI slot.<br /><br />I tried everything to make it remember the drivers and card.  This card seems to not work well with Windows 10 and I don't see any updates for it for windows 10.<br /><br />Goin
3.0,Good
5.0,"Works great, my phone detected and let me format it to FAT32 with no additional tools. Once formatted its 59GB (you lose some in the conversion metric from GiB to GB. Bought it for my Motorola Droid X first generation phone, I wanted to use it as a media player and it works wonderfully and has lots of storage for my movies, music, games and books. Its a class 10 card so its also very fast, certainly faster than the stock card."
2.0,cheap battery.  does not hold a charge like the genuine OEM battery.
3.0,There isn't too much to say about a battery: it fits the hole (the original doesn't any more due to swelling);  it accepts a charge and gives it back when you unplug the computer.  This one does those things.
4.0,The battery is great it gives me about 2.5 full charges on my IPhone 6 . The battery died after about 4 months but they contacted me and sent me replacement with in 3 days wonderful service thank you
1.0,it broke so fast... it was very week i had to buy another one :(
1.0,"This is supposed to handle high speeds (over 300 mb), but it doesn't. Had to upgrade to the SB6183."
3.0,"It works great, but it is top heavy. If you put more than one cable, you have to be careful when grabbing them because the charger welk fall off."
2.0,"I can not get it to work on my dell laptop, guess I am not smart enough to load the correct drivers. I have been on intel support and tried the discover software and drivers but still can not connect my router."
4.0,"Excellent little disk, but a little expensive."
3.0,No shut off switch.
1.0,Speakers quit working after less than 2 months. Can't find a way to contact seller to see if there is anything that can be done to fix the problem.
4.0,"This is the second Griffin Survivor case for the iPad I use. Qualify is outstanding. It looks good to show up with a camouflaged case when all the other cases at the tablet are uniformly black. (My iPhone is kept in a camouflage/hunter orange Otterbook case with ReatTree camo. The Survivor on the iPad has Mossy Oak camo.)<br /><br />I have dropped this iPad on carpeted surfaces from about five feet high. On concrete from about 4 feet. I keep all my nav charts, etc, on the iPad. Can't say enough about these cases.<br /><br />Except, maybe, that they could have molded the rubber part that goes over the shell in dark green to make it look &#34;cooler.&#34;"
4.0,"Love having all this extra space available. Sux that in future phones, Android is moving away from SD slots. I love having physical storage available, if I delete something from the cloud I can't recover it. With this that's not a worry.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because sometimes it feels a little slow. but it's nothing I can't deal with."
4.0,was a decent price for the amount of memory.  Had no issues reading it on my old HP6910P laptop built in card reader.  No problems so far.
1.0,Product description did not match the product I received. The timing was different.
2.0,"This was a good cable, until it broke in the first 2 months.  The iXCC Charger I got is still working great and I love it but the cable didn't last like I had hoped."
2.0,very slow but you would expect for that price
4.0,"I have used the old TURBINE Bluedios and I loved them, they are better quality than most other over ear headphones but they broke during the first 2 months I had them so I hope that these don't break easily like the older version of bluedio headphones I had."
4.0,It was just what I needed.
1.0,It was on time but I requested red for my grand son and it came in pink
2.0,"The computer seems to work fine, but the Windows 8 is the WORST. It took all I could not to throw it in the trash."
5.0,"One the better names in making computer accessories,  this works just fine in my LG Optimus G Pro, now I have 64GB.  I will purchase again"
4.0,love this as a spare
1.0,The battery did not work.  Will only work when plugged into an outlet.
4.0,Great audio and awesome padding but it hurts your ears after a long while of using it.
5.0,I put this in my Android to hold pictures music and all other items.  It works like a charm and a lot of room still for memory.  This is blazing fast too.  I am happy with this.
1.0,Wrong size.
3.0,it became very blurry after a while
1.0,The case itself is okay but there was a long cut across the leather I thought it was the design but it was too late when I realized that was not the case I had already rated it.
4.0,Very pretty and works well! Do have some scuff marks on it from normal wear and tear but would totally buy again!
1.0,"Hi<br /><br />I bought this laptop about a month ago. Upon opening the laptop i noticed the CD drive stuck out from the line of the laptop. This misalignment of the CD drive is not something i would expect from  a + $800 laptop. Another problem with the CD drive is that in the advertised pictures the CD drive is Blu ray. The other night i tried using a blue ray disk and the computer read nothing.<br /><br />Another problem... when typing, most times i press the space bar it squeaks.<br /><br />Defiantly not what i expected, i don't advise getting this laptop for yourself."
4.0,"Its a good Micro card, self explanatory, I haven't had any issues with it. Works for just about putting anything on it."
4.0,"I like this large size screen, and paired with an Apple Mac Mini and display port cable, I get ultra high resolution.  Images look great."
1.0,"This was my second replacement of this computer, both arrived with a defect.  Totally disappointed and have purchased a Dell from Dell.com"
5.0,"Get just about you want in it, plenty of space to keep your best shots and memories.  It's the best and the price is very reasonable."
4.0,Works great!
1.0,This product stinks. Not even able.to download adobe flash player even going thru ngeeks.com. doesnt show on tablet and the online textbooks wont work without the flash player. Even spent money on an app for flashplayer access still kothing. As cheap a tablet as price. Went from originally giving four stars to 1 waste of money!!
3.0,"The lap top case was exactly like the photograph and fabric was strong and padding inside was sufficient.  However, it did not fit the laptop which was 17 inches.  While trying to close the zipper, it tore in the corner.  I returned it because it did not fit.  With a smaller laptop it would be idea."
3.0,The drive seems to work ok but not the software. Couldn't back up my iPhone.
3.0,"Brand new it was really good when it first came out. I still have mine and the only thing I had to replace was the internal battery. If you have a kid, say around 10 years old, it's great for a starter computer. It'll help with homework, teach how to use a computer and learn how to troubleshoot a computer. Thus you're teaching how to fish rather than giving a fish."
2.0,When you turn the volume up too much there is a buzzing noise. Also having these on my head for too long hurts my ears. But i knew this was going to suck when i bought it for 10$ so i'm not disappointed.
3.0,"It's a great monitor! Everything looks amazing, especially games that support 21:9 (not many that do). I really love this monitor but there is one huge issue that will probably cause me to return it. The backlight bleed on this monitor is horrible! It is especially bad because most movies or games will have black bars on the sides and the backlight bleed is very distracting. It would be such an awesome monitor if not for the backlight bleed (or at least if it was a more minor issue). If it was cheaper I'd probably just keep it but at over $1000 there's no way in hell I'm keeping a monitor with so much backlight bleed.<br /><br />Edit: I sent back the first one and got a replacement. Less backlight bleed but still pretty bad, also the monitor is a bit wobbly this time. I don't know if I'm just unlucky or if this monitor will just always have this issue. It sucks because I really want to like this monitor but it's really making me debate whether I should just refund it or not. I'll probably try to replace it one more time and it it still has bad bleed issues then I'll just get a refund and wait for another company to release a similar product."
4.0,Yassss
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,This may be the worst memory card I've ever purchased - and I have bought a lot of card over the years - wish I had just stuck with my ADATA cardsFirst issue - I lost a bunch of photos - they just did not exist at all - it was as if I never took them  - but since there was a large gap in the file names I know for sure I didOf 200 photos taken about 40 in the middle just disappearedi could not even recover them using a deep scan toolI've been shooting digital since the mid 90s and this is the first time anything like this has ever happenedThen there is the cheesy SD adapter - the switch was so loose it switched to locked while I was taking pictures.Luckily the camera warned me that the card was read only - after having already taken a bunch of shots that has saved without issueFinally I figured I could just use these in my Samsung phones - no such luck - the second I put them in and took a photo I got an error that it could not right to the card and I could no longer see the 8gig of photos that were on itYes this may be a know issue with the cards - I see a review mentioned that - and I see that SanDisk will replace them - but they cannot replace the photos I lost - so keep that in mind when considering this card - I will
5.0,"Good for people who aren't blessed with front 3.0 ports, after I connected and mounted them to the front of my PC, I tested them. From my results, there is no noteworthy difference in speed from using a extension or the port alone."
3.0,Case is okay. Didn't like the shiny rubber that the phone sits in. That looked very cheap and covered the buttons so you had to push a button with your finger nail when needed.<br /><br />Otherwise the case worked fine. Didn't look or feel like leather...it was advertised as PU (polyurethane) leather but it didn't even try to look like fake leather. I sent it back to Amazon and purchased the real leather ACcase. Very happy with that one...and it was even less money then this one.
1.0,"This card worked in my Galaxy S3 right off the bat.  I did not need to format it or anything.  After about 2 weeks, I was watching a video on my phone and it locked up.  Then the phone showed that the card was damaged.  Now I am unable to copy anything over 100mb to or from the card.  Viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone.  Amazon customer service is great, however.  They sent me a new card.  I will update my review after I am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errors.****UPDATE****After having the second card for a few weeks, it also had the same issues.  Even worse, the card was completely unreadable after it locked up.  The card showed about 5 GB of data being used, but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer.  Sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty 16GB card."
4.0,"The item works with our camera just fine. I was concerned because the cord in the picture was a different color than the one we needed, but the proper cord was sent to us."
4.0,There are things that I would like to say about the sand disk ultra.It is the best dang SD card I've ever used.  All rights so let's be honest I just put this in my phone so that I would have extra storage for photos and videosHowever it is really good because it just sits in my phone and I don't have to do anything about it.Seriously I can access everything by Just connecting my phone to USB so it is essentially like the phone has another hard drive.
2.0,"The storage works for my phone but when you install the storage into the SD adapter, my computer doesn't read the data."
5.0,Super fast and quick read/write which i'm using for my GoPro and Surface Pro.
2.0,I installed it myself and it wasn't as hard as some comments implied. The problem is that battery life is as bad with this battery as it is with the two-year old original battery. It lasts for up to 6-8 hours with very light usage. Wouldn't buy again.
4.0,"I love this cover!! I purchased the same style for my iphone 5 (twice) and wanted to match my ipad four. It looks nice and really looks like a book. The screen is slightly covered a bit on the sides, but does not really hinder anything. I like that I can stick cards or notes in the attached holder."
2.0,"Protects to a point, but doesn't stay closed very easy due to a poor magnet.  If you can help it don't buy Irulu anyway."
2.0,Did not perform as advertised.  Threw it away.
1.0,Received today - immediately returning. Touch screen is awful. Works only sometimes. Very frustrating to not even be able to enter my wi-fi password because the keyboard wouldn't recognize my touch. My advice - DO NOT BUY.
4.0,It is what it is and does what it does: it's a keyboard. Quality's pretty great.
4.0,I'm always looking  for the perfect light ray slim protective cover for my iPad Air –  this cover is light and easy to use - wish it was a little bit lighter but it's better than most.
5.0,I got this to use in my GoPro Hero 3+ and it fit and worked well. Since that camera did not come with a micro SD i was forced to find one and i choose this one because it was the cheapest i could find at the time. This made me a little weary of the product but after receiving and using it i have no complaints. It stores and preview the pictures/videos to the highest resolution and HD quality i had to preview them on. I looked at the pictures and videos on my 60 inch TV and it was like watching HD TV.
3.0,"I put this in my Samsung Skyrocket phone.  Even though the phone says 32 GB  max, it still recognized and formatted the card.  Its great to have all of that space.However, any time i try to use the USB mass storage mode to transfer files, it errors out.  I thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec, but then I tried it in a USB card reader I had.  It still errored out trying the same files.  Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.  Took all night to get my stuff on the card though.I use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also, works great.  The phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems  plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work."
5.0,Works perfect in my HTC One V. No complaints. Love the amount of space in the tiny package. Fast as you need for a phone!
5.0,Crystal clear display; easy to use; sound quality wonderful
4.0,"Very durable. Out of all ipad cases I have purchased, this is the only one that has held up against my toddler. The handle makes it easy for him to carry. The only issue is that it is very difficult to get the ipad in and out to clean. The rubber has stretched from me trying to pry it out."
3.0,"no way to turn off blue light, keeps lap top cool though"
2.0,If you use the 3D you don't want these in the matte styling. It causes more ghosting and general blurriness
2.0,"This is clearly &#34;side&#34; lit technology, and not per-pixel back lighting, so I feel very misled.  Clearly grainy display compared to most LED monitors I've seen because of this, and isn't as bright as it should be.  Additionally, with anything at all that moves, you get a clear trailing ghost, showing that the advertised response time is not what the spec might make you believe.  Not good at all for any FPS in my opinion.  Made me dizzy.<br />It is certainly stunning simply due to it's enormous display, and works well overall, but I was disappointed and felt very misled by the specs.<br />If you're just running business apps.. it's great."
5.0,As usual anything from San Dish is a quality product.  Bought to use with my Surface Pro.  Works as described and fast connection.
1.0,Broke in 2 weeks
1.0,Doesn't work with my the xbox one.  I have to push it in all the way and hold it of it can connect. When I let go it disconnects.  Waist of money.
1.0,Not the quality I expected.
4.0,"It did what it was made room do, no problem  at all."
1.0,Absolutely terrible piece of hardware. I am on my 3rd one and it just failed. I've spent more money on shipping the bads one back for a replacement. I'm done with this thing...total waste of time and money. I asked the company to send me a better unit and I would pay the difference but they would not do.
2.0,The case is great but it's not the color I ordered. It came in black.
3.0,"When it is full with iPad, phone, pens, note pad and other miscellaneous items the weight causes the bag to deform at the top where the strap connects to the bag. In the past I had a bag where the iPad was stored horizontal rather than vertical and the bag did not deform nearly as bad. I like the number of pockets and the overal construction. Only time will tell if the distortion at the top of the bag will cause premature failure at the top."
4.0,"soft, and useful"
3.0,"This device lowered the measured noise floor of my Dacport LX USB DAC by 3-4dB vs. a Belkin powered hub.  104dB is pretty close to the performance limit of the interface I used to measure, so this unit may even do more than that.  It did not completely remove background noise from the attached headphone amplifier (Schiit Asgard 2), but I have to turn the volume almost up to almost maximum to hear any background noise now.  Update: I got an Olimex USB-ISO instead of this unit, and it provides much better isolation.  The Olimex works fine with my 24/96 USB DAC, but it may not support ludicrous speed, so YMMV."
2.0,"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s."
3.0,It is nice but I cant find the stuff I had on my old Kindle fire.
4.0,"Good Quality and look, for some reason it weigth more than my other cases and the original smartcase."
2.0,While the cables look nice they all gradually deteriorate over the course of a few months. I'm on my last one now. Quality not great so I'd suggest investing elsewhere unless you just want a cheap stopgap.
2.0,"Looked cheap, thin and and flimsy.  It wouldn't stay closed."
1.0,it doesnt work & i wasnt sent the high speed cables
5.0,Got this for my phone and it works great so far. Transferred music and pictures super fast from my computer to the card. Needed more memory and this is perfect.
3.0,I'm not happy with how the light is attached to the cover. The picture did not give a good idea how it attached. I'm concerned that the flap that the light is attached to will wear out and actually tear from use and I'm also concerned that the band that holds the light when not in use will also tear or the snap will break out of the case.<br /><br />I was so happy with the original case with the built in light but the light stopped working and I was unable to get another like it. I would have never bought this one if I knew exactly how it was connected.<br /><br />I do like the magnetic closing of the cover.
3.0,"These drives are good for the price, but SUPER SLOW."
4.0,This was just the part I needed I was amazed how Amazon made it so easy to find this part very pleased.
1.0,"Piece of crap. Noticed it gave me way too many problems after it was too late to return it or do anything about it. Will sometimes play DVDs, will sometimes take forever to play them (while making really strange noises as it does so), and will sometimes straight up destroy the DVDs altogether. Do not buy."
5.0,"I use this in a 8 MP Android phone, the speed of the card has significantly improved picture taking speeds."
1.0,Pretty funny.  They ship an empty box with no keyboard or mouse but a nice recyclable container.  Hopefully it was a mistake in which case I will update my post accordingly.
2.0,"Works, except it doesn't provide power to connected devices as is expected from 1394."
2.0,"The antenna does extend the range of your wifi, but it isn't anywhere near 1/2 mile as advertised... I returned mine."
1.0,Very disappointed that I can't use it on the beach!  The glare makes it very difficult to see!
1.0,"Got it on sale for an incredible price.  The only way I am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a 128g size.  64g is not necessary for my use, but at 128 I would be able to use it without worry of running out of space /and/ put my entire mp3 catalog on it as well.Update - about 4 months after I bought this and installed it in my Galaxy S2, it started causing some trouble for my phone.  At first I did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem, but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like ""Unmount the SD card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data"", and eventually it didn't even recognize that there was a card in there at all.  I put the old 1gb card back in and it works fine.  Put the 32gb card into the adapter, and put it into the computer's card reader... Nothing.  Wouldn't read it at all.I do back up my phone occasionally, maybe once a month, but lost everything; every photo and video I had taken of my new kitten since I got her because of this.  It is very surprising since Sandisk is usually quite reliable.  My wife has the same card in her phone, we got them around the same time, and hers is still working normally so far.YMMV, but always back up your data regularly (more than once a month) if you are taking a lot of pictures and video."
3.0,Seems like a really good backpack. Unfortunately the photo on Amazon does not meet match the product as of the date of this review.  The black backpack is actually black with lots of red highlights. Not a big deal unless you're buying this for a picky teenager!
3.0,"It is super nice looking but too light to carry a Laptop, could be a little sturdier.  Must get a strong laptop sleeve with it."
5.0,"So I got this SD specifically for my GoPro Black 3+, simply hoping it would work since the GoPro manual says &#34;use cards up to 64gb&#34; and the SanDisk says it's good for cell phones and tablets, yet doesn't mention the GoPro.Well, turns out it works perfect! And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it's only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S. It's small, simple, durable, and has no lock feature (which I always found to be an annoyance anyway).Any questions please feel free to comment, and I will do my best to answer."
3.0,"The modem model itself is fine, and was recommended by Comcast. When I called Comcast to swap the MAC address out on my account, they were able to see the modem and even restart it. HOWEVER, I seem to have gotten a modem with a bad network port on it. I had it hard wired directly to my laptop and got no lights, signal, nothing. even did some troubleshooting with Comcast tech support. This is a refurbished model, but it looks like this one is just a lemon. Sending this back to try one that is brand-new instead."
4.0,god
2.0,works if it is a stand alone port however most of these multiple display port setups are side by side. this thing is so bulky I had to cut the VGA port cable head to get both to fit. This is on 4 computers....<br /><br />2 broke in half too... ... went with the pigtail style instead.
3.0,Not what I ordered.  No 19V output as advertised.  But it will do.  I'm using 19 1/2 and hoping everything goes OK.
2.0,I'm not exactly sure what happened but someone definitely interfered with this product or the packing was terrible as the plastic covering was moved and the pre prep solution was missing and the tubing was not flat and sticking out of the packing
2.0,"I purchased a Steelseries Apex keyboard. The minimal documentation ( two 4x4 pieces of paper)  that comes with it says the User Manual is located on their site. I have been unable to locate it. It would seem that it would be located in an obvious place since it is not included. The site is not at all user friendly. The keyboard itself seems to be fine, but if I can't get a manual to be able to utilize the features than it is pretty useless. I can just purchase a standard keyboard."
2.0,"For some reason the receiver is slightly larger than the average nano receiver .   It has trouble working on different surfaces this this could be due to the very old laser design.   The design is reminiscent of the first laser mouses that started showing up on the market 10 years ago, if you look at the laser you can even see it flashing.   But the strangest thing about the mouse is it doesn't seem to work on steam. Could I be the only one having this problem, possibly. Trying to play L4D2 or Payday 2 I find the mouse skips and freeze, it  made playing impossible. I don't understand why that would even happen.   The scroll wheel is almost useless, I'm using a 13.3 inch laptop with 1080 resolution and while scrolling up and down it will jump half the page, HALF THE PAGE! Whatever I was reading, whatever I was doing left me far behind thanks to this wheel. Useless Wheel."
2.0,Not needed
4.0,good - miss the spell check and wish it would have had Microsoft Office on it. Other than that - it is great.
4.0,Works fine overall. Sometimes I have issues getting the games out.
2.0,iPhone often says that the cord is not compatible and will not charge.
4.0,"I bought three of these cards. One died one day (in my Galaxy S3) after about a month and a half of use. The phone said the card was removed unexpectedly, and it never functioned again. The phone still recognized all other cards. I contacted SanDisk, and they shipped out a replacement under warranty.The cards have served me well. Two are in Galaxy S3's, and another in a Galaxy Note II. Copying to them is decently fast, and they are great for music or video storage. Phones have no problem playing 720p video off the cards."
3.0,"Pros: mostly: super light.  also: functional, designed specifically for sp3<br />Cons:<br />1. Overpriced and, honestly, should come included with the pro series like the pen comes with the pro series.  In my personal opinion, you can't call it a laptop without a keyboard...<br />2. NO PRINT SCREEN!  This is a huge thing for me.  Sure you can take a screen shot that will then save to your screen shots folder that you can then attach to send someone, but that's a bagillion more steps (yes that's an exaggeration) than &#34;alt+prt sc&#34; then &#34;ctrl+v&#34;.  You can also do something with the pen to make it appear in OneNote, but again, it's NOT the same.<br />3.  Material<br />  3a. Whoever designed this keyboard has clearly NEVER OWNED A PET.  It's basically a pet hair magnet.<br />  3b. Gets dirty and dingy super fast.  I've had it less than a week and it's already collecting dust and dirt on the bottom (I got the purple, thinking that it would do better hiding dirt and stains than the cyan...not so much with the dirt, might still do better with the stains).  From what I've been able to find during a search (somewhere in between brief and intensive) for something that protects the type cover and still allows full functionality of the kickstand, is that such a thing doesn't exist.<br />  3c. The edges seem really destructible.  They haven't frayed, split, or separated yet (again I've had it less than a week); however, I see this a distinct possibility.<br />4. There is nothing on the keyboard indicating that there's anyway to use the keyboard to change the screen brightness.  The buttons that look like that will make a difference actually change the key backlighting.  Took me forever (and a friend looking it up) to figure out that Fn+Del or Backspace changes screen brightness.<br />5.  Personal dislike of how the Fn keys are set up.  Factory default is Fn lock. So you press any of the F1-12 buttons and it does the Fn task, not the F1-12 task. Example: F8 performs search without having to hit the Fn button. That's all fine and good, excect that in order to use the key command alt+F4, you have to first hit/hold the Fn key (and because the Fn key is on the right side of the keyboard and my hands are small, that means that I can't close a window using the keyboard with only one hand). So I finally figured out how to toggle that off (hold Fn and hit caps), but then realized that, because the home/end/pgup/pgdn are F9-12, I'd have to then us the Fn key in order to use any of those.<br /><br />There are a couple other things that I prefer about my laptop keyboard.  But I recognize that they'd be difficult to accomplish with such a compact keyboard and can therefore concede those items."
1.0,This charging cable is not good. It started sparking. I bought this for my Surface Pro 2... That's what it said it was for. It's going back!!!
4.0,good
4.0,Don't really use this for speed tests or anything but to hold music and everything it works great would recommend doesn't fail a lot and lose files
5.0,I needed a micro SD card with more storage for my phone.  This was a good price for a lot of space.
1.0,I threw it in the trash. It did not adhere to the Nook surface at all. Complete junk in my opinion.
1.0,"Shy of two years old, this device's battery barely holds a charge. Very disappointing for such an expensive tablet."
3.0,"Design is comfortable. There's not much in the way of customization since you have to cycle through the DPI button, the side buttons can't be programmed and the color lighs are constantly glowing, but it stands out as an affortable semi-pro mouse.<br />EDIT: after 6 months of non-heavy use the wheel became loose and became unusable since the mapping of scrolling was jittery. I started using wheel click to scroll but never got used to it so I gave up the mouse."
5.0,"I bought this an formatted it to FAT32 so I can use it in a devices that say they only allow 32GB card.  To do this you must find a program that will format card above 32GB into FAT32.  Windows will not format anything 32GB and higher in FAT32, so try this site for a program to do it in:  [...]"
2.0,Might be good for reading email but that is about it.  Couldn't keep up with Visio drawings or mid level graphics programs.  Used it with a Mac air 2013.<br /><br />Mouse was also very laggy which was the killer for me.
1.0,I upgraded the firmware to the latest and also install the OS X 10.10.4 from scratch but no help at all.
5.0,"Seems to work great so far. holds many, many pictures."
3.0,Good price. Works as described. Wish the cord was a little longer. The unit does get very hot with use so need to be careful where it is located so you don't have a problem.
4.0,I wanted a good sized SD card for my Android phone. This one was priced well and has been working without a glitch.
3.0,Works great with windows and windows phone.  Too bad the keys were laid out for apple.
4.0,Thanks
2.0,"Disappointing! Have had the Kindle Fire for about a year. At first it worked fine. Then in the past month, haven't been able to download library books through Amazon's manage your device and content and sign in pages. The content does not show up on the carousel as it had been doing. Finally, I had to click on &#34;read in browser&#34; which makes it kind of difficult to enjoy reading as there is the continual browser heading above. Will not be purchasing anymore Kindle Fire HD tablets."

The card performs efficient read/writes and is giving my phone the kind of data storage I never thought I'd have.  If anyone is looking for enough storage space on their phone or tablet for a large amount of pictures, video's, apps, or even document files, this may be exactly what you're looking for."
3.0,Cheaper version of the Speck.  Lesser quality - already lost one of the &#34;feet&#34; on the base.  Doesn't fit snuggly around the computer.  Spend the extra money for Speck.
1.0,Product was DOA. Will not buy another Toshiba.
2.0,Ok-not fabulous. Extremely hard to remove iPad from this case.<br />Worked fine but I returned so I can find something that suits my needs.<br />Extremely short charging cord.<br />Easy to set up but I think I want a true charging/keyboard case that only requires one charging cord and allows me to use if no wifi is available.<br />Not a horrible product-just not what I am looking for exactly.
5.0,I have used this to store recorded video information from a dash camera.  I have had no problems so far.
5.0,"Great flash drive with an incredibly convenient shape! I've owned mine for a few months now and it's been a lifesaver. However, it will probably work best for those who have smaller keychains or a way to protect the contacts from being scratched by other keys.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />The drive corrupted on me recently, though it was likely due to user error. Keep this in mind, however, since it is relatively easy to bump it out of a USB port."
2.0,Nice clean fit. However product started peeling off after a couple months.

5.0,"I got this for a Microsoft Surface.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do (wish the Surface was more user friendly with it though... but, that's another story).  One thing to watch out for: this will not work in older SDHC compliant devices.  I tried it in my D80 and it wouldn't work at all.  That's not a problem with the device so much as with the buyer knowing what they are buying."

3.0,"Seems slow in my USB, but all these multi's seem to be."
4.0,The two side buttons for front and back page functionality are a bit low for my taste and as a result I tend to accidentally push them.  I would rather that they were not included or that I could disable them somehow.
3.0,"I bought this and the Logitech hd pro C920 and the C920 was well worth the difference in price.  The MS LifeCam's audio is fine if you are in a recoding studio but if there is background noise, it's going to pick it all up and make it hard for the people on the other end to hear/understand the intentional audio."
4.0,New to e-readers but overall I like the Paperwhite. Good battery use. Very easy to use plus Amazon automatically updates the unit. Very pleased so far.

3.0,Good but not great for gaming.
4.0,great
3.0,"One major design flaw keeps this from being a 5 star product - the PC board. It's simply too low to the bottom that it interferes directly with the capacitors on the edge of the motherboard. Thus, you can not use it &#34;as intended&#34; - at least on my board, as well as many others based on reviews. I made a mount and mounted it in my 3.5&#34; drive by internally. It's annoying to have to open the case to power the lighting on and off, but since I keep my computer off during the nights to conserve power anyways, the lights or normally running 24/7 when the PC is on.<br /><br />3ft is plenty to do a nice ambient effect inside of your case, I feel the 2m length would have been slight overkill as these LED are plenty bright even on the lowest setting. I'm using them in a Phantom Original with a modified window side panel, accenting a Red/Black build with white / red / blue fans.<br /><br />Works as intended with the exception of the mounting for the switch.<br />3 solid stars."
4.0,I bought this on Amazon Prime so I ended up buying the 16gb one for $95.  The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.
5.0,It fits in my phone. It holds lots of stuff. It comes with a reader that works in my laptop.

Otherwise it doesn't even deserve one star.<br />It was easy to install, just plug it in, the computer automatically installed the driver no problem. But the movements and clicks don't register. I then returned the original one I purchased and requested a replacement... Same problem with that one. Not to mention this Tonor Brand only has an amazon storefront, no website, no customer support found anywhere. Very unhappy with this purchase and lack of customer support.

Got the same guy on the phone, this time he said &#34;When did you buy it?&#34; to which I replied on 8/19, and he said&#34; Oh send it back to them and get another one.<br /><br />So I sat for a week expecting them to at least reply to the email I sent, waiting to get a replacement that they had no intention of sending.<br /><br />The moral of this story is simply AVOID ANYTHING MADE BY SABRENT."
2.0,Wasted hours trying to get this to work properly.  Couldn't get any laptop or phone in my house to work right with it.
4.0,"it's been three months since I've bought it and is still functioning perfectly well; I mainly use it to play games. It feels really light compared to older mice I've used even with all the weights they've provided. Overall it's well made and a good mouse for the price; the only downside is trying to change the lights from pulsing is quite annoying, as sometimes the software the company provided is unresponsive."
4.0,"Replaced a 7 year old targus backpack with this one. Wish the top handle had a bit more give so i can secure it to my rollerboard handle, but this backpack does the job and has a lot of space"
2.0,It worked very well for the first few months but after the left mouse button would occasionally double click. I made sure not to press the double click button but often when I pushed the button down it would click and when I released the button it would click again. This made it very frustrating to browse and game. I eventually went back to my older mouse that worked fine.
3.0,"USB ports work well, but every time I plugged in my phone (not apple) to any of the ports, including the charging port, an obnoxious high pitched sound was produced."
1.0,This item did not fit my Kindle fire 8.9.  I had to return it and try another item.
2.0,"I originally left a very positive review....which still holds for the most part, however I had to remove my iPad from the case, (with which I am always careful) and the plastic holder that the iPad clips into cracked!!!!  It's only a few days old! Seriously??"
3.0,"This case not only feels flimsy but was also bulky. Its very design makes it impossible to utilize the surface pro 3 to its full potential. Here are the list of things it hinders me from using:<br /><br />1) It prevents me from using the kick stand as it covers the entire back of the device. It replaces it with fold-over cardboard thing that only allows 1 viewing angle.<br />2) It causes my surface pro 3 to overheat as it covers up all the vents and causes it to SHUT OFF mid-use.<br />3) It prevents me from using the magnetic keyboard feature to tilt up the keys as the cover is way too bulky.<br /><br />Not only that, it doesn't provide adequate protection. The edges are far too close and if it falls screen down I can guarantee that your device will break. I just contacted customer service and I will increase my ratings from 1 to 3 if they follow through with my request for a refund."
5.0,Convenient charging!
1.0,"Now this was money not well spent. Its not even the product I was looking for. The tips does not work with my HP, even though it says it does."
5.0,"SanDisk makes great products and this one's just another of them.  I'm using it in a vehicle dash camera to record HD .mov format video and on my shakedown run the camera and the disc worked perfectly together!  32gb of space gives me plenty of room to record, and the Class 10 rating means the card is plenty fast enough to keep up and produce crisp and clear video.  Color was also good."
1.0,Didn't sit right on iPad hard to push buttons
1.0,It did not work!
1.0,Did not work
5.0,"Good stuff! Works with my newly bought Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)  no problems at all. I am happy."
2.0,"Wireless signal keeps breaking, but work if your patient enough"
2.0,"Cable seems sturdy enough, and much sturdier than similar cables for the same price. However, after only a few weeks' use, the connection is now loose and has to be held in the phone just right in order to charge it. It worked well at first. This has been the same with 3 AmazonBasics USB cables that I have bought now.<br /><br />If these weren't sturdier cables, this would be a 1 star review. DON'T BUY."
2.0,"I received the XD card inside [plastic cover case, which was inside of a plastic ziplock bag. I have been purchasing New XD cards for the past 6-8 years and I have never received one that was not inside of a regular cardboard sealed package. It appears that this card was not new. The XD card was also not fitting right in the plastic case that it was in."
3.0,"I recently managed to buy what is apparently one of the biggest, if not the biggest laptop still available on the market (an ASUS g751). It's 17.3&#34; and 8.4 pounds. None of my myriad carrying solutions is sufficient to fully enclose the beast and I am partial to protecting it when mobile.<br /><br />I bought this Case Logic backpack solution as it was highly regarded by other reviewers. The features and benefits of the pack are as described and It has proven to be rugged, comfortable and efficient for all the extra stuff I stow (not only is the g751 huge and cumbersome,but it's power adaptor is also large and awkward).<br /><br />I took two rating stars off because when I firmly nestle the laptop down as far as it will go and give an extra tug to the pack's fabric siding, the zipper strains around the corner of the laptop and the device,s shape can be discerned from how it distorts the carrier.<br /><br />Since I bought this for one purpose: to port around a leviathan of a laptop. The laptop is a 17.3&#34; device which the pack is billed to fit. While I don't do gymnastics with it on I suspect that the strain from the weight compounded by how tightly the zipper's teeth have to clench around the device that I'll probably be replacing it because of a busted zipper or torn fabric.<br /><br />Shame on me for not getting out measuring tape and double-checking...I foolishly assumed a 17.3&#34; pack that claims to hold a 17.3&#34; laptop would require extra precautionary steps to ensure it would actually contain the g751 17.3&#34; computer. I knew going into this that the device was unwieldy."
4.0,Well made and priced right.  Shipped on time.
5.0,Super Fast!  No need to steal everyones reviews! Honestly everyone with a 5 Star speaks the truth!
5.0,"wouldn't trade it for anything. i need the extra space, so it is very helpful. and sandisk always makes good stuff"
3.0,It works good but gets very hot. I wouldn't use it for a long time.
1.0,Don't be fooled when you check the properties of the card because it will show 128Gb which must be accomplished by some cleaver software programming?<br />7.4Gb per h2testw testing.<br />I tried on two different computers to download 8Gb of music files and it could not store over about 8Gb.<br />I tried formatting on two different (Windows) computers and it could not complete the formatting.<br />Fortunately Amazon is going to refund my ~ $22.
4.0,Good.
3.0,"i wish there is a way to turn off touch screen, then turn it on depending on my use. Also, battery keeps running down. I either have not figured out how to turn off something or it stays &#34;on&#34; in spite of being in AIRPLANE mode when not using amazon store.  suggestions"
2.0,Its short of being garbage. Don't buy it... It sheds whatever the material that the cover is made of and the built in stand is a joke...
2.0,"The product itself is fine, but it is not a 120hz monitor. When searching 120hz monitor in amazon this shouldn't be the second one that pops up because it isn't 120hz.  That being said the blame lays on me for not reading thoroughly that it was just a 60hz monitor but it shouldn't be advertised as such on amazon either.<br /><br />So good product just know it isn't 120hz."
4.0,good product
5.0,"The thing I hate about writing reviews for products like this is that they either work or they don't. There's not a lot of &#34;user experience&#34; to be had. If the card is fast enough and doesn't give you read/write errors then it should get five stars, right?Five stars!"
3.0,"Great little flash drive that doesn't take up a lot of space. Cheap.<br /><br />Beware, it gets hot."
1.0,Was fine at first but after a month I noticed chipping on the corners. Soon it was cracking and pieces were breaking off. I have never dropped it or even been hard on it.  Terrible!
2.0,"I purchased this charger in April. And today, four months later it no longer works, when I plug it in it doesn't seem to recognize my phone anymore. Before this, I bought the Amazon iPhone charger and it lasted just about as long. These chargers I use to charge the phone at night, so it might occasionally tangle up into me at night, but usually it is just sitting on my nightstand charging. I'm really quite frustrated with how poorly this has lasted, especially considering how many positive reviews this cord has, I would have hoped it would last at least six months. I guess not."
2.0,"Range is terrible. I have this keyboard less than 10 feet from the receiver, which is plugged into the front of the PC, on a wooden coffee table. But the pointer lags and rubber bands unless I pick up the keyboard so the coffee table isn't in the way anymore. Once I do that, the performance is adequate for most purposes, but I wouldn't play a game with it."
5.0,great price for such a super big storage. works well and so far no problem. will highly recommend for smartphones and tablets.
2.0,I could not get this brand of memory card to work in my Roku.  It would not format correctly.  I had to return this for another brand which worked ok.
1.0,"I bought this laptop for college. The laptop works fine. It runs everything I need it to run for school. However, after 2 years of careful use, the laptop literally began to fall apart. Funny thing about Acer is that they have a LIMITED 1 YEAR WARRANTY for their products. This obviously is a manufacturing issue, but they were no assistance to me. I contacted Acer and they directed me to their 3rd party assistance and the man on the phone told me to &#34;go to staples. They can help you fix it.&#34; IF I WANTED TO GO TO STAPLES I WOULD HAVE CALLED STAPLES! I called Acer to get assistance from Acer. The man also told me that since my laptop is no longer under warranty, that in my attempts to call Acer, they would not help me. There was no way I would ever be able to contact a REAL person. Therefore, I am writing this review very upset that I WASTED money on a laptop that may not make it through my undergrad career. Acer was no help at all. Save yourself the trouble and buy a Dell, a Mac, Toshiba, Sony, ANYTHING BUT AN ACER."
3.0,"I have the folio style Fintie cover for this model but would like to respond to comments here about having to turn off tablet. I usually keep several windows open like Chrome with a few tabs, Evernote to capture and edit shared content, Pixlr to edit screenshots, Email and Facebook. This arrangement works well for me because Android 4 handles multitasking and multiple windows very well - much better than Windows on my desktop computer.  To have to turn off the tablet to keep the Home button from activating the screen whenever the cover is closed would definitely slow down things for me.  BTW the Fintie folio style cover has the same problem, too, but to a lesser extent. In any case this discussion has inspired me to modify my current case by adding small dabs of something like silicone to keep the cover from activating the Home button as much.  EDIT (08/31/2015): For my Fintie folio style case I added two small  pieces of 5/16&#34; thick self-stick closed cell foam to either side of the raised Home button which has kept it from being activated inadvertently. Perhaps that would also work with the &#34;smart&#34; style case. IMO the best solution would be a case that had a flat one-piece cover rather than the ones that are so common these days with 3 sections that fold to create a make-shift stand which does not work that well. If I want to use a stand I use a stand- I prefer a cover that is just a cover."
5.0,Been using it for a month and everything works fine.I have my SD card encrypted and it does take a little bit longer to transfer.It does get warm when I transfer files for more than 2 minutes but I have not had any performance issues with it.Overall 5/5
1.0,"This product does not work! & seller claims to have &#34;90 day warranty&#34; but after purchase, you cannot find this information anywhere. After several factory resets to get this thing to work, and it still not working, I've determined it's a waste of money. I kept receiving the following image and it just wouldnt work. Buy something else!"
1.0,Returned. Does not allow the keyboard to mount properly
1.0,"Used it four times. Wasn't very useful, since it stopped working after the 4th use"
5.0,"If, like me, you are still happily in the Stone Age with Windows XP, your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install Windows Update KB955704.  This update is available from Microsoft.com.Thanks to dOGG94, who pointed this out in Customer Questions and Answers on August 6, 2013.  I installed this update and am now able to load GoPro's pictures onto my computer. dOGG94's answer to the customer question provides the link to the update.  Amazon did not allow me to post the link here.  I don't know why.  Just go to the Microsoft.com updates site and look for KB955704.  Or go to the indicated question for the link.The product description should have provided this information."
2.0,"It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as ""Sandisk Basic"", not Sandisk Ultra"", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2"" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though."
4.0,I have no problem with the refurbished Kindle so far but just received it last week.
2.0,It interferes with the main wifi
2.0,"These do NOT operate at USB 3.0 drives per the hd_speed utility i use. Also, ONE lanyard for TWO drives, really?! The only thing i like is their form factor."
2.0,"Bought this card for my Galaxy S4 and after installing it and loading my music, the card was randomly ejecting itself. After like the 3rd ejection of the morning, the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged, so I reformatted. The random SDCard ejection and Damaged card kept coming up. After googling, I read that the Galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with SanDisk cards and its a hit or miss, some phones have no issues. I have replaced this card already, which Amazon, shipped me a 2nd card within a few days, but the same problems arise. Not sure if I should switch to a different brand, but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being. Maybe I can give it away to a friend who doesn't have an S4. :/"
3.0,"It's  a cheaply made, rubbery-type of material that wasn't what we expected, but glad that we got it for a great deal.  It does the job to protect your iPad from children drops and slips.  Keep in mind it does not have a screen protector.  The case is thick and we haven't had any issues with it not standing up like you see in the photo.  I would buy it again."
4.0,"Should have come with the kindle instead of having to purchase it.  FYI, I saw in a couple of reviews for this product that reviewers complained that it did not work.  I've found that if it is not plugged into a receptacle correctly, then it will not charge.  Much like the charger on the earlier kindle models."
1.0,I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents and should of went with gut instinct and sent back! They both are very finicky to get to charge! One of them charger port broke quickly like the 3rd day....no biggie used USB port to charge. Not a good idea 7 months later the thing is dead and won't charge! The screen also has a spot where it's not cracked but is white. I thought something was on it but you touch it and the area gets bigger! The second one now at 8 months always shows its charging but nothing's plugged into it and the battery level is going down! It freezes constantly and I've factory reset it and only have 2 apps installed on it! I've deleted those apps and it still freezes! I'm sure it's only a matter of time before it quits too! I didn't expect much for price I paid BUT it should last more than a year!
1.0,"I have an old SanDisk SD card that still works. I thought their new cards would be just as reliable, but I was wrong.The microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone. I used the adapter to connect it to my computer, but it wouldn't mount.I bought this directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor, so I know it's genuine SanDisk."
3.0,It charges a Samsung S6 about 75% as fast as OEM Samsung adaptive fast charger.
5.0,"WOW. Transfer speeds on this MicroSD were phenomenal. I was using it on a Galaxy S2, and transferring everything from music to movies from the phone to my computer were fast. I mean a song per blink fast. The acronyms are getting a little crazy now (SD = Secure Digital, SDHC = Secure Digital High Capacity) and the 1 on the lower left means Ultra High Speed 1. Even I don't know what that means yet, but this thing is F-A-S-T."
5.0,I have purchased and used several SanDisk memory cards and I have never experienced any issues with those cards.  One of my first choices when I am in the market for a memory card
4.0,It was just as expected
2.0,"It's smaller than my kindle fire, can't see that it offers anything special"
3.0,Went bad in about a month
1.0,"Power cycles numerous times every time my laptop awakes from sleep mode.  I've already disabled the &#34;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power&#34; setting, along with all other power management settings that might be contributing to this problem.  Also, installing the latest driver (1.0.0.32) was a chore.  Not sure why the standalone driver also includes a &#34;Genie&#34; component, but I figure Netgear's software engineers may be a bit behind the times, and I'm not even a developer."
5.0,Use this with my GoPro Hero 3 HD to record high definition sports video and this chip does it very well. I would definitely recommend it
5.0,What can i say my old 8GB died and this is working like a champ trust the brand for a long time and expect nothing but the best
5.0,
2.0,"This notebook bag does not provide maximum protection because the corners and the bottom of it are NOT covered with the same EVA bubble material as the rest of the main compartment; the corners and the bottom are made of just plain fabric. I wanted a bag that provides full protection everywhere, so I returned this bag, and I bought a different one from another store."
4.0,"My 15-year-old son built a computer for me and said this case was a good, basic one in part because of the built-in cooling fans. So far, the case is doing it's job"
1.0,"This is so old. I waited about two months without bluetooth for this thing to arrive, and I ended up throwing it away! There is so much interference that I cannot use a bluetooth keyboard & mouse at the same time. Also cannot be repuposed to use as a wireless hub for gaming cintrollers because it is so old. Do not buy!"
4.0,"Just bought it appears to be working well. The only thing is that it isn't as good of a fit as the original battery, but most non-manufacturer batteries have this problem. Still a way better price than the manufacturer replacement battery."
2.0,"I was replacing a 350 W ATX power supply that's on its last leg on a 24hr a day continuously running PC, blowing out very hot air.  My first attempt was with this high end Corsair, works fine, but starts heating up after 1 day, almost as hot as my older ATX power supply.  Definitely not worth the price, esp. with the energy / electricity lost in heat."
5.0,"I am very pleased with this memory card, I use it in a dash cam in my car. The quality of videos turn out great and I have no compatibility issues with any equipment I may use for playback."
5.0,what can go wrong? right? it works and fits what else is there - great price and i love the adapter
4.0,"After extensive review / research I wanted the best 64gb available to improve/increase memory for Samsung tab 3 7.0 many cards out there but this one loaded up quickly and appears to be ready for add on apps and preserving meory storage. The price was right, delivered quickly even with holiday, loaded and was quickly loaded/compatible with Samsung tab 3 7.0. Sandisk actually has a use chart that will show shopper what card to use for their device. Very helpful"
2.0,"Bought this at 16.99 and it's incredibly cheap. Falls apart when you try to rotate it around, and made out of super cheap materials."
2.0,"I have returned my Orbo Jr. for a replacement.  The reason I returned the item was that I was unable to connect to my Wi-Fi.  In reviewing the web for a solution my sense is this may be a commen problem.  Nonetheless, the Orbo Jr has all the features I wanted for my grandson so I am going to try one more before I give up."
5.0,My first discrete soundcard.It was absolutely amazing
5.0,"My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price."
3.0,I love the unit ad a whole...it's small enough to fit in my laptop bag but big enough to my laptop.  I don't use it that much and the fan has stopped working.  I very disappointed in that.  I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for that.
3.0,Everything okey except the ram only 512mb (Showed by cccleaner). Spec say the tab has 1gb ram. What's wrong Amazon?.
2.0,bad design. The power port broke within the first 2 weeks and would never charge. Acer support is useless. They want you to ship the laptop back and be without a computer for 6 weeks. That is not the world we live in anymore. They would also not provide a loaner laptop. Looking online this is a known issue.
4.0,It's taking me a while to get use to the key pad ( it's a bit small) color is clear easy to hold also.
1.0,I purchased two cords about 3 weeks ago you both have broken poorly constructed
2.0,"The battery has to be perfectly placed partially out of the slot in the back in order for the mouse to work.  When that is the case the mouse works well, but overall its a pretty big hassle."
1.0,Purchased as a present for nephew and it worked great for a few days then it started acting up.<br />They had to return for a refund.
5.0,Perfect for my daughter. Loves the size and ease of setup. Great laptop at a cheap price.
5.0,"Didnt know it came with an adapter card to make it into a normal micro card, super handy, fits in my tablet perfectly and reads fine."
3.0,It does tend to come out of the laptop port a lot but it was inexpensive and does provide power/charging to my laptop
2.0,"Bought 2 sets and after only 2 weeks, 4 of the cables are already no good."
2.0,"The zipper is sticky at one spot and it drives me nuts!  But, for that price it's just fine."
3.0,It's advertised as having a 6 hour battery.  It actually is only 3 hours or so.  That's disappointing.  Other than that it's great.
4.0,Very good.
4.0,"I have several devices that use micro cards, so I buy these in anticipation of needs in the future. So I am not going to test this to see if it works when I get this. Most items I buy at a good price. Now if I am loading up cameras and recording gear for a trip or maybe a day at Le Mans. I will check them before I travel, as I check batteries and spares and chargers.So far I have not had a problem with SanDisk, I am gearing up for a trip, my destination is a bit in question at this point."
1.0,"Two out of three cables died within two weeks of using them.  Unfortunately, I didn't have time to post this before my 30 day guarantee with Amazon expired.  Do yourself a favor and buy the more expensive cable.  It will pay for itself, especially when you put your phone on the charger all night only to wake up to no alarm clock and a dead phone."
2.0,Charging portion on tablet broke after about 6 months of use.  Not heavy usage by any means and did not use an after market usb micro but both tablets that we owned failed the exact same way.  Don't think I will be buying another HP tablet.
5.0,great
2.0,"Unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s2. I installed it and the phone would &#34;check&#34; it only to tell me &#34;SD card ready for removal&#34;. This was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to FAT32, NTFS, and FAT the card would not work and would revert back to exFAT format.I do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my 3-stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site."
2.0,Returned. Thought it was a tv.
3.0,Didn't exactly fit my drive bay.  Had to do a little finiggling but made it work.
3.0,"I'd say this is a great modem when it works. Having worked in IT for over a decade, I'm pretty good at install and config, but the first one was a dud and neither the tech nor I could get it to play nice with Comcast. Popped a temporary modem on for about 12 hours until I could get to a local brick-and-mortar to pick up another of this exact modem, and lo and behold I got a working one. Reconfigured the connection, and it's been stable for a couple months (minus maybe five manual reboots, of which I don't know the exact cause as the levels are proper). Searching around, this is a relatively common issue, so if you get a dud just swap it out and hopefully you'll be back up and running.<br /><br />I made my pick off Wirecutter's suggestions and the potential for upgrades in my area. We just got bumped up to 75Mbps down, and I'd say speed tests average around 78Mbps throughout the day and night. This certainly has enough capacity to go above this as well, so maybe once the entrenched ISPs get enough competition we'll see how high it can go. *crosses fingers*<br /><br />Taking off two starts because while it works, it certainly isn't 100% stable and there seems to be a wider issue with quality control for this model. But if you get a good one, it should max out most connections."
1.0,Hooked it up and it would not connect. I now have to rebox it snd return it. Also I will now have to pay the $39.99 moving fee and $5.00 rental fee to my local cable company because I have to use there box until u get on that works
3.0,"Very cool, but HEAVY (for a usb stick). If you're using it in the car, it'll probably work it's way out of the slot"
2.0,Didn't last long &#60;(;o(
3.0,Good
5.0,"Super fast compared to my other cards. Didn't do any tests, but this is much faster than no name &#34;class 10&#34; cards."
5.0,I needed more memory because my phone kept telling me I was short on memory. This is more than enough memory and I have so many pictures on my phone now! This was a good buy!
2.0,Wire cracked after two weeks of use at a desk. Wire does not work.
2.0,"After ordering a 6th gen. cover by mistake, the 7th gen. cover was a letdown.  Although the material it is made of feels the same, the cover seems to be not as sturdy (more flimsy) and there is no magnetic clip to hold the cover closed (like on the 6th gen. cover).  I'm now going to have to figure out how to keep this thing closed so that it isn't always turning on when the cover opens accidentally.  I called Amazon to complain about this cheaper version of cover as the cost is the same as the 6th gen. cover.  My opinion - if you can, stay away from this one and find another that is better.  If you need a 6th gen. cover, I say go for it - 7th - NO (not at this price)."
1.0,"Hello,Great card, great price. Plenty of speed and worked for...about a year. In fact, I wish it had stopped working a month earlier.It looks like Sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something, because now on the end of December (Return window expired about 20 days ago) this thing only intermittently is recognized. It unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted, and usually it doesn't even remount.While it was a good price, it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of Sandisk going &#34;ahaha got you good, now you have to buy another expensive name-brand card!&#34;Nope, I'll buy a cheaper alternative and it'll probably last longer. I still have some Kingston's going strong."
5.0,"I'm into photography and I just got a gopro.This micro sd card is a class 10, it's great for photo/video and the best thing that I has, the price. I went to bestbuy, walmart, target, even a CVS looking for deals and BE AWARE, you'll find micro sd cards &#34;on sale&#34; but none of them -class10-. The cheapest I found a class 10 of 16GB was around $40.So be smart, get this with time and wait patiently."
2.0,Awaiting delivery
1.0,"Not very happy with it. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Easy set up, worked fine for 2 days. Then started having problems with playing videos on Facebook<br /> Spent hours on the phone with tech support. Still unable to play videos. Also the touch-screen is not very responsive."
4.0,"I rate the keyboard with 5 Stars, but the clips that holds the tablet on 4 sides of the case, I rate it at 3 since the way it is designed, those could break after several times the tablet is attach and detach from the case.  Besides, the upper lefthand clip is situated on the volume control of the Insignia Tablet/PC that could disrupt the volume at any given time, while in use.  The case itself, I rate it at 4 Stars.  The price is fair."
3.0,"I just went out and got the RT87R router and i have been trying to set this up and have a been having a lot of trouble with the customer care. The router itself the range and speeds are great as long as its connected. But i have been noticing that my phone keeps dropping off the 2.4Ghz. I called the customer care which is absolutely terrible!! very rude agent to the extent she even hung up on me. I had to call back to report her to their floor supervisor. I was first told that i need to change the auth method and encryption on both 2.4 and 5 G then was asked to change the control channel on both 2.4 and 5 G. but still no luck. The 5g had totally stopped working and when i changed it back to auto the 5G started working again. Now I have the 2.4 on channel 6 and still i notice that i get dropped the 2.4g<br /><br />I think this is a great router but Asus needs to have their reps know what they are doing or have it properly documented. For me this is mostly a return, i still have 12 days left, so i'd probably keep it for a bit to see how many times i keep getting bumped off the 2.4G.."
2.0,not happy my monitor came with a lot of back light bleed
1.0,"I must warn those of you considering this modem that it is very poor quality.  It runs very very hot.<br /><br />It worked perfectly for three months and then failed.  Granted, it is under warranty, but to determine it is broken, you have to pay for a service call that costs more than the modem.<br /><br />On the Comcast site it is ranked as a one star out of three based on its certification.  Buying it cost me a bundle in the long run."
4.0,"I selected this product for two reasons:  1) the presence of an on/off switch and, 2) toolless installation of drives.<br /><br />The on/off switch is important because I prefer a controlled way of removing power from a drive and toolless installation means it's easy to swap out drives.<br /><br />That said, it is a bit difficult to open.  The whole top slides off and there isn't much to grab onto.  By the product's design it appears intended to be a semi-permanent enclosure for a HDD.  In this role it is superb.  However, if your needs require frequently changing out the HDD you may wish to look to a product expressly designed for that purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I like the unit and appreciate that the manufacturer included a foam rectangle to place on top of the HDD to help prevent it from working loose during movement.  With the foam in place the unit feels rock solid and the HDD does not shift at all inside the enclosure."
5.0,Fast transfer speed and got it for a great price. Used in my GoPro Hero 3 BE for many hours of recording and haven't had an issue.
5.0,"I've never had any issues with SanDisk, I always buy and trust their product. I bought this one for the Sansung Galaxy Note 10.1 and works very nicely. I wife loaded all her books and music on it and still huge amount of space left."
1.0,"I got a card and it wouldn't let me copy files to it, it would (a) not recognize on any of the three computers or my android tab at home, and (b) unmount itself in the middle of file copies.  These two things happened randomly.  I got a replacement, but it suffered from the problem of letting me format it (yay, farther than I got with unit 1), then crapping out 300mb into a file transfer.AVOID THIS GUY."
1.0,"it did not work, I try charging for hours and nothing, and it is more expensive to send it back."
3.0,"It wasnt a perfect fit, I had to retro fit it a little. A pain but works."
1.0,does not work
2.0,"Worked well for a while, but the pin broke after only a few months.  Not very good quality."
3.0,"Works perfectly and charges my phone while attached to the attachment in my car, but while attached my audio set up doesn't recognize the device. I cannot utilize my phone as a music device while using this attachment in my car."
5.0,Seems to be working great. Thanks!
1.0,"December 2014 Anker bought a Bluetooth keyboard. After eight months using Six Number button, then use this failure is impossible."
5.0,"Works great! We plugged in the Ethernet to the LAN 1 on &#34;the local&#34;, plugged a phone cable into the line jack, ran it out about 300 ft and plugged it into the Line on &#34;the remote&#34; unit. I could then plug the computer into the LAN 1 at &#34;the remote&#34; and it connected beautifully! We even have a junction in the middle of the phone line and it still connected without a problem."
1.0,"Well, I *was* excited about this HDD until it arrived today. I opened the box and there's no !@#$% SATA cables to connect it to my computer!"
1.0,Worked well for a short time then just stopped working. Save up for a better cable.
4.0,Working fine.  Like the fan.
4.0,"This otterbox case is everything I hoped it would be and more, because while it provides all the usual protection I've come to expect from Otterbox it also looks good. My iPad mini 3 fits into it well with a little coaxing of the rubber at the corners. The device is very securely held inside. The wrap around protective cover has a very pleasant soft feel and closes with a magnetic clasp. It has a book like appearance. The case may have a little heft to it but it also fits easily in my purse and is easily carried around. The only negative for me is that when the case stand is used to watch a movie the magnetic clasp doesn't fold quite flat enough so obscures a small part of the screen. It wasn't too hard to figure out how to keep it out of the way but I'd be happier with the case if that wasn't an issue."
4.0,For a cheap mouse this works great.
5.0,"This is one of those products that either works or it doesn't (which rarely happens), so what can I say.  It work's great.  32 GB allows plenty of room for storage in my tablet, and with the high rate transfer speed apps run as quickly as if they were using internal memory storage."
5.0,fast shipping will do more business
4.0,"Awesome little addition to my desktop.  Was very easily plug and play and it reads everything I've put into it so far (CAC card and SD card).  Only complaint is the speed at which it transfers information from PC to SD card (could be the card, will have to see) and that the screws for the mounting bracket for those of us who don't have a 3.5 bay are too far forward, preventing this guy from sitting flush in my case.  Other than that, no complaints.  Great product."
5.0,"I bought this card for increased storage on my Galaxy S3. I had zero issues using it this way. If you're contemplating doing the same, ignore the theoretical limits you're reading about. The 64 GB card works fine on Galaxy S3and the entirety of the card is recognized, not just the first 32 GB."
2.0,"It was difficult to install - the AutoPlay notification only came up on the third try. Then after an extended installation time, I could not figure out how to get it to play a video. I put a disc in, the drive would whir, but nothing opened up. I expected it to start playing when I inserted the disc.<br />I finally figured out that if I go to the VLC media player software on my computer, I can open videos through that. I've spent a couple of hours googling and trying various things and that's the best I could come up with."
2.0,"I really liked this at first because  it was a replacement of my Gen 2 by same company and brand. I had mis-placed it temporarily. . I carried the Gen2 for a YEAR never lost the cap because it had a good friction fit. This Gen 3 model  from the first day I thought that it wasn't secure. The cap fell off after a week of use and can't find it. Luckily I found my gen 2 I had so I started carrying it instead until I find the lost cap  (if I ever do)  it will STILL have the same problem though.  Wacom offered to send me another cap after jumping through the hoops, which I thought was really thoughtful. Was not begging them for one but notified them that I thought it was definitely a design flaw.  UPDATE: Well I found the cap and less than 12 hours later lost it again so returned stylus for refund."
5.0,Great value and works well
2.0,"You get what you pay for, just a little over a year old and the monitor constantly craps out on me.  Have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to turn on(multiple times daily).  Pain in the butt."
2.0,"Item were delivered on time, which I like a lot. One thing about the product is it doesn't work at all, i got a Samsung galaxy note pro 12.2&#34;. The s mouse connected to my tablet but none of the function work. So great delivery, bad product"
4.0,My son said they are good. Not even close to his turtle beach set but well worth the money. Very pleased.
5.0,This 32GB card is fast.  Great for storing video and music and whatever you need to do without worry.  It is plenty large and the price is very reasonable.
3.0,"This is the only vertical magnetic holster I could find for my iPhone 6, so despite the very cheap leather (if real at all; not worth $35), I will still keep it.  After only one month, it is showing wear at the corners.  Unless you really want the vertical magnetic closure, you can pay less elsewhere."
4.0,"A good replacement cable for the Nook HD+.  The cable is not as nice as the original, so that docks one star, but otherwise it is fine."
2.0,As soon as the kickstand is opened it never really settles back into place and flopping out. Also it broke really easily. Its nice but i'd recommend something else
3.0,good but there are better products
1.0,"It didn't work. I installed the battery and allowed it to charge. When I went to boot up my computer, it would run for 15-20 seconds then turn off. I sent it back. When I was looking for another battery, many of them looked identical to this one. I chose one that wasn't identical and had a slightly lower Wh rating."
4.0,"Pretty good price, great performance! I've been using micro SD cards for years, tried many brands mostly cheaper. There is a reason they've been around and will continue to be!"
3.0,"It's fine, it's not very far reaching though."
4.0,"First one died after 10 minutes of use.  RMA was easy, and the second one works great and is fast.  This is the first time I have had a problem with samsung memory, so this is the first 4 star review I am giving them."
5.0,Currently using it for my Samsung Galaxy S3. It's very fast when transferring files in and out. No complaints so far.
1.0,Buttons are next to impossible to push. Have to give up using it.
3.0,"There are so many laptop coolers avaiable and I could not find any that stand out as the best solution, they all have mixed reviews.  I bought this one because of it's price and above average reviews.  I was disappointed that the reviews did not mention how many degrees the temperature was lowered by using this product, but I am starting to understand why (I will talk about that later).<br /><br />My laptop runs research programs at 100% utilization 24/7/365.  I believe this makes me uniquely qualified to give feedback on devices claiming to cool laptops.  The first product I tried did not help, it actually raised the processor temperature.<br /><br />Before you buy a laptop cooler, the internet has some suggestions that may stop your laptop from overheating:<br />1.  Remove your battery:  If your laptop is plugged in, remove the battery.  The continous charging of the battery produces heat.<br />2.  Reduce your Maximum Processor State to 99% (in advanced power settings).  This really does make a difference in temperature without a noticeable affect on performance.<br />3.  Elevate the laptop so that air can flow under it.  The heat of the laptop will produce a 'chimney' effect and get air to circulate around it.<br />4.  Keep the laptop open while processing.  this sounds like a 'no-brainer' but I needed to be reminded of that.<br /><br />If you follow those steps you will see a decrease in processor temp (I use a free app called CORE TEMP to measure the processor temperatures).  If you don't follow those suggestions and just use this product, you will see a similar decrease in processor temps.  If you do both, you can expect a greater decrease in temps.  I have seen a decrease of 3 to 6 degrees Celsius using this product and the above suggestions.  However, when I tried to change the Maximum Power State back to 100%, the laptop ran at maximum temperature until it overheated again.  In other words, this product did not solve my problem, it was just another tool that helped my laptop run a little cooler.<br /><br />Like I said, this works, but it is not enough on it's own. Maybe being powered by USB is the problem, maybe an AC powered fan is the answer."
5.0,"If you carry two of these, one in your camera and one in the camera case pocket (don't lose it), you will never run out of memory. Enough capacity at ~4MB/image to shoot and shoot and shoot.  Download at the end of the day if you want, but you have thousands of pictures on one of these. Couple with batteries (see WASABI review) and you can just never stop shooting."
3.0,Works but nothing like the pc version so glad to have it but not much....
4.0,"good tester, had to get this for the company and i got more for reimbursement and i get to keep this"
1.0,"Internet connection light was solid green, yet my devices frequently stated that there was no connection to the internet.  Tried it in different spots in my 2 story house, but nothing made a difference. IT DOES BROADCAST YOUR SSID. I know that that isn't the best/only method of securing your wifi but it does make it easier to see if it's broadcasted.  Bought a Netgear EX2700 instead, it allows you to disable broadcasting and the internet connection works perfectly in the same spots I put the TP-LINK product in."
3.0,"I've only used the product for a short time, but noticed that my system has been locking up after I started using the card. This was on a new system with a fresh install of Linux Mint 17.2."
4.0,"I am enjoying the new keyboard, but the setup was a bit more than I anticipated.<br /><br />Coming from the flat, mac keyboard, many of the shortcut keys involving cmd were awkward for my reach. Also, the &#34;previous track&#34; and &#34;next track&#34; keys only worked in itunes. To remedy this few complaints, I downloaded Karibiner (it's a free software program) to reassign keys. A quick internet search will show how to reassign keys for those who may not be savvy.<br /><br />This keyboard was not &#34;out-of-the-box 100% compatible&#34;, but I am enjoying the keyboard now and I would recommend it to others.  Overall nice job."
3.0,Okay
5.0,"Much faster than my other microSD cards, most if which are class 4.  In a galaxy S3 now, fast enough not to slow it down when loading files/music/photos.  Did not Benchmark..."
4.0,long wire
5.0,Came in good working order. Easy to install.
5.0,"$20. less money than comparable Samsung. Very fast. Installs easily. Would recommend to a friend. Also, I appreciate the &#34;user friendly&#34; packaging."
1.0,Broke within a week of getting them
2.0,"PS Oh yeah I forgot to mention that sometimes when i right click, it just clicks and takes me to another page which i dont want. My SD card port is already not being detected. (only had for 2 months and 3 days). Plus side: it has an optical drive, but I don't think the programs installed allow for full screen playback of DVDs."
4.0,I like case
2.0,"the fan flickers, and sometimes the product does not turn on. It does not do a great job keeping my computer cool, i wish i could get my money back or at least a repalcement."
3.0,"Does the job, although the antennas are extremely extremely weak!"
3.0,It is smaller than expected. My laptop fit fine but wont fit additional such as charger or headphone.
3.0,Covers part of the screen making it difficult to get to some menu items.  Nice material but design needs a little refinement.
2.0,"A lot of research was done prior to purchasing this laptop. Seemed like a good deal for basic computer. Since my daughter has been using for 3 months - basic usage - watching netflix, browsing net, writing papers, there has been a consistent issue with slow speed AND touchpad and keyboard intermittently stop working. Sometimes at the same time! We are now having to purchase another one and will have to return this to Dell."
5.0,Case looks beautiful and fits my Paperwhite snug. Couldn't be happier with my first Clever Books case
5.0,"I've been trying for a while to get a hold of a 32GB Micro SD for my phone and tablet.  It's pretty fast compared to the 16GB cards I've been using.  I really saw the performance boost with my phone, which I have many apps, pictures, music, and other documents on.  The phone boots fully stable in about 2 mins as apposed to 5-6 mins.  My computer also can write to these cards much faster than the 16GB ones I was using.  If you phone, tablet or any other device can support it I recommend you purchase these.  Also you pay like half the price using Amazon as opposed to other retail stores who's price is at least double or more.  I've seen these same cards going for about $72 in my area."
5.0,"Using it in a cell phone, and so far no problemsI would recommend this o anyone who needs more memory"
5.0,Nothing interesting to write. It works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card. Thanks.
5.0,"After using it for a while, I have not issue at all.Have been taking pictures, videos, doing a lot of copy/paste/delete this little 32GB SD card. Not like my other SanDisk 32GB which only last for about 6 months.A small note. Not sure if it is the color or the design, the feel of the card (red/gray) is a little thicker then a regular black SD card. I also need to use little force to get the card out the digital cam. On the bright side, I do not have to worry about dropping the CD card like others since it does not slide out when try getting it out."
3.0,"Picked up this memory card at a great price on a gold box deal. Reputable name, fast card. However, after several months of trying to get my phone to work with the card, formatted it, partitioned it. &#34;mounted&#34; the card, &#34;unmounted the card,&#34; all to no avail.  I realized that this memory card is not compatible with my Samsung SGH-T769 (Galaxy S 4G). No need to get frustrated and try a Sandisk &#34;Ultra&#34; 32GB Class 10 card in the phone. I replaced this card with a &#34;plain&#34; Sandisk 32GB Class 4 card in my phone, it was immediately recognized, formatted and mounted by the Samsung phone.YMMV"
5.0,I bought this awhile back. and I must say it worked just fine and exactly what I needed. its nice.
1.0,cheap. broke almost instantly.
3.0,"the box on the cord gets way too hot. and of course, it's two feet shorter than my original cord so i can't sit where i'm used to sitting when using my laptop."
3.0,"Purchased this a few days ago and like a lot of others has said, it does produce an incredible amount of ghosting. I've included a video. I use it mainly for development and occasional gaming so it's not *too* bad for me. However, the ghosting is significant. Other than that, it's a great monitor and does everything as advertised.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN9pzhxTCic<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />I ended up returning this monitor and purchasing the ASUS PB287Q. A lot better monitor and has zero ghosting!"
4.0,"Looks good, seems to work well--fast transfer of data--although I've already encountered one type of USB device (micro disk adapter) that it refuses to recognize. I have to that USB directly into the computer to access the disk. I'm hoping this is not a progressive problem and that over time I discover more devices that won't function on it. Fingers crossed."
5.0,good storage
4.0,Best feature is the ability to use iPad landscape and portrait with ease.  Love the color.  Mine is blue.
5.0,All good!
4.0,"it works, so far, waiting for the heat and cold to see how well it will hold up."
5.0,I have always been satisfied with sandisk products this memory card did not disappoint with it's fast reading and writing ability Sandisk has done it again.
4.0,Bought two and one did not work. Did get a refund from Amazon.
2.0,"Bought this to hook up a Cisco switch in another part of the suite and once run, it didn't have enough signal to use the switch.  It would work for internet when hooked up directly though.  I'm guessing it was because of the very thin 'shielding' it has.  Had to go buy another cable somewhere else and once I had them laid side by side noticed that this cable was only about 130 feet long.  Buy because its cheap but spend more if it is mission critical."
1.0,"I am currently writing this review with the microsoft touch keyboard because this stupid thing broke. I got it two days ago, and it started out wrking fine, and then it just stopped working. Do not buy this keyboard under any circumstance."
3.0,This was an ok mic but it broke after not that long. Maybe a few months.
3.0,I hate the windows but the laptop does what i need it to do
4.0,I accidentally ordered two of these one blue and one green.  I am currently using the green one and I especially like the fact that you can set it on your knee to read the Kindle books.  The camera had a shadow on the pictures I took and found out that the hole for the camera was a little off center  so I enlarged it by slipping it over the blades of scissors.  That is the only complaint I have about it and that problem was solved.  The Fire HD6 is kind of hard to handle because it is rather slippery  without this cover.  It fits nicely in my purse and protects the Fire HD 6.
2.0,Cheaply built - You get what you pay for.
5.0,Easy upgrade for my HP Elitebook.  So much faster and smoother now.
2.0,Brought the blue ombre for my MacBook Air because I'm messy and get stuff everywhere. Let me just say it's not awful. It does pull up every once in awhile when your typing. It kinda gets stuck to your fingers I guess. I does fit over the keyboard well. Sometimes it moves but nothing unbearable. I was content until I realized that my books were blue and fingertips were blue. At first I just thought it was excess dye but when it didn't stop after the first couple of days I got annoyed. Its been a week now and I've noticed that the keys are starting to lose their color now because the ink is all over y fingers instead of the keys. Just a heads up! I will never purchase again.
1.0,Has anyone had trouble with the volume on this product? Amazon... you disappoint me once again!
2.0,"Great product, solidly made... if you are wanting to hookup an external hard-drive. However. It will not work with my old firewire 400 CD/DVD Burner.<br />Which, was why to bought it in the first place."
1.0,"Bought cables in 3ft, 6ft and 9ft.  NONE of them worked.  NO FUNCTIONALITY WHATSOEVER.  Tested many times, its as if the copper wires are just not connected to the terminations.  Do these even go through Quality Control before they leave the factory?  Waste of money and time."
3.0,"I wish with all my heart that an instruction manual had been sent along with my order.  I am not as good about figuring things out on my own.  I've been trying to get my kids to help me, but we are having trouble getting together, so my tablet just sits there waiting for me to get with it.  I love the opening page on it.  It really touches my heart.  I just really wish I could use it,."
2.0,This does not fit all Macbook Air Laptops. There should be a picture clearly showing what the end of the charger looks like.
4.0,Is a nice product hope won't fail as some of the sd cards
2.0,"Received this and it will not let me open apps. It will let you download them, but when you go to open some of them, it says it's unsupported."
1.0,Product is great. The delivery was awful and not as advertised
1.0,Did not work. No matter what phone we tried it did not work at all.
2.0,"SanDisk does not make this drive. They do not even make this style. This is a generic USB flash drive stamped with the SanDisk name and packaged up in an equally counterfeit package. (You might also note that a virtually identical &#34;Samsung&#34; drive is listed by the same seller&#34;.)<br /><br />Also, counterfeit drives are invariably fake-capacity drives - low capacity drives hacked to make them appear to have a much higher capacity.<br /><br />In fact, *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will becorrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.is faked.

1.0,dont even bother to try - will not show up in finder and will not show up if placed on any reader
3.0,The product was deliverd as per schedule.  Thats definitely  a innovative thought byt i dont feel that this product is worth of  replacing the regular hand mouse. As the red pointer blinks all the time it will be quite disturbing to use .i can give 3 ating because it is cheap and a innovative thought
5.0,"Exactly what you're hoping for in a micro-SD card. Tons of space and super fast. And YES--local storage is absolutely necessary for media storage! Tunes, videos, even pictures....back them up on the cloud, but keep a copy/copies local!"
1.0,Returned. Useless.
2.0,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking begins its configuration with a volume and clarity test of the microphone. This microphone failed both tests repeatedly even after extensive fine tuning of the HD sound card controls in this Windows 7 Asus x54c notebook. The microphone was plugged into the audio input jack as opposed to the USB port. ( there are two different models of this microphone... ) Perhaps the USB model is superior to the audio jack model, but I did not try that one out. Or maybe the Asus sound card is inferior. But the VXI Blue Parrot Xpressway bluetooth mic configured perfectly on the first try and performs extremely well."
4.0,"This sticker fits just over the whole apple on my 15&#34; macbook pro. While you have to be extreamly accurate to get it perfect, thhe end result is epic! Much better than most stickers. However..Im OCD so I pressed down very hard so there are no bubbles but if you look very close you can see how I pressed hard and the apple underneath - its outline is a tad visible..but from the normal looks your gonna get its epic!"
1.0,I really like the size ad look of the USB but I keep getting disconnected while transferring files. Its almost like its too loose and just doesn't fit right.
4.0,This power supply works great. it is quiet and has all the plugs that i needed
3.0,These do not last wear out quickly.
1.0,"After I got it synchronized with my iPad and started using it, my iPad froze, crashed and failed recovery. Any compatibility issues with iPad?"
2.0,"Pros: great sound, covers the whole ear, isolates you from the world.<br />Cons: heavy, uncomfortable for long periods, squeezes too tight.<br />I own an old set of Razer Carcharies and wanted to replace them. The reviews for the HyperX were great and that is why I purchased these. However I am a gamer and this set is extremely tight and much heavier than what I am used to. This weighs around 1 - 1.5 lbs and my Razer is only 8oz. I feel the push on top of my head but the worst is the squeezing of the cups on both sides. the set is made so if you do not wear them the 2 cups meet each other (which was not evident by the photos of this product), the gaming set I have is open and leaves 6&#34; between the cups when you lay it on the table. Granted the sound is very good but this will give you a horrid headache. Wearing these also prevents you from hearing anything else but what you listen to, so if your mom is calling, phone is ringing or someone is calling for help you will be none the wiser."
3.0,"Can't give a full review, as I had to send back my Dell XPS (purchased X where)~"
5.0,protection en good material
4.0,"Not much to say really as it arrived on time and it works.  I actually used it to replace the battery in a tire pressure sensor on my motorcycle so had to remove the yellow protective covering, which is quite thick btw, and cut the plug off to solder to the TPS circuit board but it works fine."
1.0,"The perfect review for this case was already written for a larger size cocoon grid it wrap case by Whoopsie, here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUUO4I0HBAZ4/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FSZ70E&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=541966&store=pc<br /><br />I decided to take a few pictures of my case to show how it looks when having a few charging cables in the grid and two thin Razor Plus battery chargers.<br /><br />It looked like a great idea bur realistically there is not enough room to have something in the case and other items in the grid. It's a stretch (no pun intended) to close the wrap even when it's empty.  I don't have a lot of things in this case and it still ends up looking like an ill-fitted burrito.<br /><br />Then, there's the velcro design fail.  When you have the case unwrapped, flat open, the hook side is face down.  The hook side is the part that catches and scratches things.  Not so bad if you unwrap it on a hard surface.  But not so great if you open it on carpeting or a bedspread or...<br /><br />Cocoon needs to make the flap longer to accommodate items in both the case and the grid.  And they need to be more thoughtful about the velcro situation.  One suggestion would be to reverse the hook and loop placement and add another swatch of loop near the hook side, so that when you have the case open you can tack the hook side onto that."
5.0,"I purchased new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones for my wife and me. We wanted to be able to take pictures and family event videos without constantly worrying about not having space on the phones. The cameras on the Galaxy S4 are wonderful, but that means bigger files too. These &#34;SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card&#34; are fast and we have not even begun to fill them up."
5.0,It does what is expectected. I bougth it to use with my GoPro and it works perfectly! I recommend it!
5.0,Excellent!!  Worked as the way it should be!
4.0,For the price  this tablet does the job. The Antroid OS system is more then sufficient to handle  your daily tasks. The display is good also. I would not agree that the battery last for 7 hours as stated in its write up. But ultimately this tablet is well worth it for the price.
2.0,fell apart rather quickly
1.0,"I used this hard drive for extra storage on my Wii U. It worked fine for about a year and then it just suddenly died. It doesn't power on any more and is no longer recognized by the Wii U or my computer, so I'm assuming all of my saved data is now gone for good. This isn't the first Seagate hard drive to die on on me, but I promise you that it will be the last."
3.0,"Could this go with my computer build, i mainly want it to cool down my graphics card, and if it doesn't go for it can you point me in the right direction, would be appreciated, here's the specs: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/zFr73C"
5.0,In constant use on my Samsung Ativ 700t since January with narry a problem. I just bought my third one :)
5.0,expanded the storage space on my 16gb note 2. Check out online to see how to make the phone think its the native space. Fast enough to capture HD video and 8MP photos. Would definitely recommend it!
3.0,"I'm a former gamer but still a PC power user at work and home, and I really rely on a good mouse to be effective.  Something about Logitech Sensitivity just doesn't cut it for me.  I can't put my finger on it but I gave this mouse an honest chance for over 1 month, and I would still misclick things because the mouse is just unpredictable.  Also it's larger than most wireless mice, but it's still not big enough for a large hand.  The left-hand friendly design means it only has a place for 4 fingers, so your pinky will still drag or feel squished on this mouse.  Also one thing that is REALLY annoying is if you leave it idle (ie if you switch between keyboard and mouse frequently) there is a delay when you go back to move it, and it always makes the first click a misclick.<br />My advice, if you can deal with Logitech quality already, you're probly fine, but don't expect it to work for you otherwise."
4.0,Just what I expected. Works great.
1.0,"Sadly, for no reason it cracked.  It was not dropped, I had just finished using it and walked from the living room to my bedroom to charge it for the evening.  I saw the crack form before my eyes and thought WHAT?  this hairline crack may have happened from the colder temperature in my room, but it wasn't a crazy climate change. Regardless, it rendered it completely useless.  I can charge it and hear emails come in, but the screen no longer allows me to swipe and therefore it is useless.  I am sad that is was so poorly constructed.  I have friends and associates that have dropped tablets and phones and had the screen crack like a WEB or Puzzle and still the tablet functioned.  This is a barely noticeable line (I thought it was my hair at first) and the tablet no longer works."
4.0,Just what I expected.  Packaged and delivered as indicated.
5.0,Excelent
1.0,"Stick with the 32GB model. First one got SMOKING hot about 1 minute after use, but it seemed to function. Then I installed it in my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it got hot in the phone. After a day it just quite all together, luckily I still had my 32GB and a backup of my data. Did an RMA and got a new one, which didn't get hot but died after less than a month of use. I'll wait until Lexar's 64GB comes down in price a bit and then try that one...but not this SanDisk one! Their 32GB seem to be ok though."
4.0,"everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine."
5.0,Works well...small...doesn't take up space
2.0,"Pretty good but two corners, the upper left and lower right, squick every time you touch them. It's as if the back casing is loose and it makes for a bad experience. Otherwise, great tablet."
2.0,Thought I was getting the tripod and mount.
4.0,Seems to want to generate a new IP address for the router out.
2.0,Beautiful bag but after two days of having it the strap busted. Seems like cheap material maybe
1.0,It Failed. It only worked 3 months.I used it in a Galaxy S3 phone. It seems that this brand has an issue with this model.I lost the information.
2.0,Bluetooth is very inconsistent - many issues with apps freezing
2.0,"Note that it is not 1 foot of wiring for each branch of the 'Y' but one total foot at the longest points. I can't even connect to my 2 monitors because they are more than 12&#34; apart.<br /><br />If you are like me, trying to connect a laptop/tower to 2 monitors, this will not be sufficient. To be honest I don't know what purpose this could possibly serve with this short of a connection."
2.0,"Cool design, but WAYYYYY overpriced for what you get.  I picked up a Talent iClaw and it works just as well for a fraction of the price."
3.0,"The power connector looks like it was run over by a forklift. The bins are somewhat smashed, but eventually I was able to force it onto my drive. After that it seems to work ok. The instructions aren't very good, so I would not recommend this unless you know what you are doing with a bare drive."
2.0,Keyboard and touch pad not user friendly; too spaced put
5.0,Modem works well with Comcast.  I occasionally have to turn it off and on again.
4.0,nice aluminium finifhed.<br />USB cable prvided is not USB 3.0
1.0,"Died after less than two years, won't turn on. Google search shows this is a pretty common problem."
3.0,Not the movement I was expecting but it is a good quality analog. It is very useful in trying in many projects using an arduino for example.
2.0,"Quit working shortly after getting it, but past 30 days return policy :("
5.0,My granddaughter's phone was slowing down. She had a 2gb memory card in it and no room for any more photos. She transferred all 499 photos to this 32gb card and has room for many more. Love making her happy!
2.0,"The outlet plug does not stay in the charger at all, it falls right out if it so much as gets moved, had to not only tape it in but at an angle because unless its jammed in just right it won't work<br /><br />disappointing for the price, I feel like I should have just gotten a cheaper fake one"
3.0,"It's just okay, even considering the price range.  The battery life is less than 2 hours.  The screen is only viewable from a limited range of angles.  The speaker output is pathetic.  But, it does at least work, and it offers a decent operating system and specs for the price.  If you just need a tablet to do the absolute minimum with, this will work.  Just don't plan on doing much before having to charge it again.<br /><br />The processing is pretty slow, though netflix runs just fine.  I would recommend the iRulu x1 over this.  The two tablets are pretty even in slow processing, weak speaker output, and storage capacity, but at least the x1 has a beautiful screen that is not grainy and can bee viewed from a wide range of angles.<br /><br />Really, the only reason I gave this product three stars is that it works, and it is dirt cheap.  Also, don't expect any help from the tablet's producer.  I emailed them looking to find out what screen protector to buy because the original one scratched up easily.  They told me that they do not produce any screen savers for the tablet, which is ridiculous considering they sell the tablet with one installed.  I asked for a way to contact the actual manufacturer of the tablet (since the customer service from the distributor was an aggravating joke) and never got a response.  Basically, expect NO customer service or support,  This is basically a disposable device, and I reviewed it as such."
3.0,Good case not great it does the job also holds 2 memory cards and business cards.
4.0,colors change without my say so. but its awesome so who cares
4.0,it works.
3.0,The cable stopped working after several months like all lightning cables.
2.0,"This thing is so restrictive you might as well sit in a straight jacket to use it! I am just dumfounded at how these companies think they have the right to control every thing we do, limit how long you use it AND now limit HOW many people can use it! Unfreakingbelievable. Well guess what, WRONGO, not for me anyways mine is going right back to their controlling hands. The only good thing about it IMO is the ombre' color. here's SOME of what I hate;<br />it is only useable for a YEAR, yup after that they gouge you for $ to keep using the 'CLOUD&#34;<br />They have a thing called defender, sounds good right? WRONG. if you read the whole users agreement when u first sign up/on it explains that this stupid program &#34;helps&#34; you by removing adware and suspiscous apps. ok so far, THEN it goes onto say it might delete some of your apps/files by mistake, oops but supposedly thats ok even though they say it could be something you only bought with one license, in that case you're sol, because they're not responsible and it's YOU who will have to shell out more $ to buy another liscence! it'd only be a mistake silly goose.<br />The Mcaffee virus protection that is on there free for a month, oh my they're so nice, they want a picture of your face & even a sample of your voice, to protect you of course you silly bean, what else could they possibly want it for silly? It's a thing they called Biometrics sounds mathy. I no like math.<br />I only got that far, that was enough for me! I'm sure they have so many other lovely features to &#34;help&#34; you, cough cough"
4.0,"First experience with a Kindle, better than I thought."
5.0,Id say that this product is a steal! Now i am able to expand the storage size of my tablet to add more hd movies!
4.0,NetCam was exactly as advertised and performed as expected
5.0,"Absolutely, revived an old PC!  Ridiculous improvements on speed.  Now the main PC I use at work rather than a laptop with external display.  Very easy/quick plug-n-play install.  Comes with a mount too! You be dumb not to purchase this! Cheers Transcend!"
3.0,Great headset but if you spread them to put over your head they tend to break
4.0,Shipped on time and item as expected.
4.0,"I would give it 5 stars if I could stop the colors from changing. I don't know why they thought people would watn their mouse constantly changing colors. Otherwise, works great for the price."
1.0,Skips all over and can't control mouse-Returned
2.0,The case itself is okay. The real problem is the inside flap that folds under the tablet to secure it in place is too bulky. It is secured by velcro but the velcro strips are so thick it bulges making it hard to close the case.
1.0,too slow
3.0,Face plate fell off
2.0,"As so many others have pointed out the obvious pros/cons of this extender I will only add one point and then ask a question.<br />This device is nice because the Dragonfly sticking out of a USB hub is an accident waiting to happen. I like having the Dragontail to remedy that situation.<br />My question is this: When I use the DragonTail with my Dragonfly, the first 5-6 seconds of the first song played gets cut off. Every time. Has anyone else had this issue? Tech support at AudioQuest was very helpful, but it was only after I checked to see if I had sufficient RAM and that my drivers were updated, and that it was not an issue with my headphones or stereo, that I decided to remove the DragonTail, which solved the problem immediately. On that basis I give this device 2 stars. I need it, but it messes up the audio playback. That's no good."
2.0,"disappointed, no micro sd or sd expand option, the storage in the tablet Is not enough"
3.0,My granddaughter loves it but we bought it because we thought it would be on wheels and we would like to have a handle I can run the picture
3.0,Worked as expected
3.0,"I've loved this cover for its versatility and protection, however, the edges have unraveled after 18 months of use. I've requested a replacement since this product has a lifetime warranty. Update: The sellers replaced the first one and the second one has already peeled at the edges and corners after less than two months. Will try a third time in case I&#34;m just getting lemons. Also, the second one did not hold the iPad as securely in the corners. If I dropped it, I feel sure that it wouldn't protect it or keep the cover in place. Downgrading to three stars for now."
4.0,What can I say about a power adapter? It works as expected.
5.0,I bought this memory card for my dashcam and it works perfectly.  I have no problems with it's write speed or resolution of video.  You can trust SanDisk for a quality product as I have many in use and have had no failures yet.
4.0,"What can I say SanDisk has the micro SD figured out.  Works with Asus Memo pad hd 7, movies for long trips."
4.0,Overall great product.  Used primarily for entertainment.  Sharp display and easy to interface with.  Very good value for the price!
4.0,"Working great so far. Haven't experience any connection drop so far.  Easy setup, and matches my maximum connection speed."
5.0,Great protector case just sqeeze the sides and they pop open.
5.0,Reduces desk clutter and matches the monitor and my MACBook Pro perfectly.  Took about 60 seconds to install.
1.0,"I would not recommend this computer to anyone. I purchased this computer last year and have used it for a while, and at first I liked it a lot because it was the first computer I ever had. The main problem I have with the computer is the slimness factor. Although the slimness of the computer may be a selling point, I would take into consideration that this weakens the computer structurally and has other downsides.  I took it to school and &#34;dropped&#34; it from a very low heigh and the display didn't close correctly. I can bend the display with practically no force whatsoever. The typing on this keyboard is especially odd and will take some time to get used to. Because the computer is very slim, the keys have no place to go (downwards) so they are very shallow. I had a tendency to double press the keys because there was no tactile feedback that I had pressed the key. The last major problem that I had with the computer is the fans. The computer only has 2 fans inside, one for intake, and one for exhaust. When you use your computer and the components start to heat up, the fans kick on and try to dissipate the heat. Well because there are only 2 relatively small fans inside, they have to spin at higher RPMs to get rid of the heat, which results in lots of noise. Even with one Google Chrome browser tab open (and I know that Google Chrome uses lots of system memory), the fans sounded like they were going to explode any second. I have had lots of problems with the battery! Only a few weeks after I had the computer, I had to send it to Acer for them to replace the battery because mine was not functioning. It had something to do with static electricity getting into the system. This was very frustrating because randomly the computer would shut down, sometimes in the middle of writing papers for school.<br /><br />Pros and Cons list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim Computer<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slim Computer<br />Loud fans (with only one tab open)<br />Nonfunctioning battery<br />Bad keyboard (had a tendency to double press the keys because they are very shallow)<br />Very unstable / not sturdy AT ALL (Could bend the screen with ease)<br />HIGH price point!<br /><br />In the end, I would not recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new one or an upgrade."
5.0,"No problems and works for what it is, would buy again and recommend without any hesitations, good product. and value."
3.0,Not sure if it's working correctly.  I am having a hard time getting it to start my laptop up.
3.0,"This is not like the incase iPad mini case which I LOVE!!<br />This one is way thicker and bulky, not what I was expecting. It was returned!"
5.0,And does it fast. Been installed in my Acer Iconia Tab for months and has endured file transfer after file transfer with not a single glitch.
4.0,The hole for headphones could be a little bigger but no other complaints.
1.0,Didn't work properly from the start. Many of the menus were in Chinese/Japanese/Korean and were unintelligible.  Deleted Apps reappeared when the phone was rebooted.  Would not stay connected or reconnect to known WIFI signals.  Finally went completely dead in the middle of a business trip so I had no communication with my office.
4.0,good product
5.0,"Price was great, Delivery was on time, now I have plenty on storage in my Gopro Hero 3, The SD card adapters makes things much easier to transfer files to my other devices."
4.0,Product worked fine.  The directions do not explain well enough on how to open the box.  To open:  put BOTH thumbs on right side of box and slide forward with pressure ONLY on the right side.  (the right side when &#34;window&#34; is toward you).
1.0,"Most of these positive reviews are DEFINITELY written by paid reviewers (who did not receive the NAS in exchange for their reviews). Just look at the other reviews written by these alleged reviewers, and you'll see nothing but glowing reviews for products (with some negative for books thrown in, to cover things up), and some of those products are the same, like the iWatch stand that almost no one on this planet owns, yet is glowingly reviewed by multiple people who just happened to also review this NAS.<br /><br />I cannot stand deception like this - it is so offensive. This is not a terrible product, but it's obviously an uphill battle for a Chinese company trying to make their own OS to compete with established companies, and this is not the way to do it. Screw you, TerraMaster - stop it, or continue to be called out on it. Your product obviously has some serious problems, based on the few real reviews here, and is not ready for foreign markets."
1.0,These are not very sturdy. They move with the slightest touch to the screen. Do not buy!
5.0,Got for my phone and is awesome.  The card did short out but once contacting SanDisk they had one out to me in a week.  Super awesome customer service.  Will buy more SanDisk items when needed.
1.0,"If you have a Contour camera you want to use this with. It will not format! Don't even bother.Now I have room for about 16,000 photos. Not what I wanted."
2.0,"Good afternoon. I had expectations that I came across the complete purchase, but must inform you that I missed one (1) Kingston 8GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory"
5.0,One drive out of 4 died before being able to configure the RAID. Sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement in no time. Now I'm happy with a RAID5 config. I was hoping to have it done on the first shot but a dud drive is found every now and then. Thanks Amazon!!!
1.0,"had kinks in it,slower than wifi"
5.0,"My Windows Tablet came with a 32 GB Storage space allocation.  This allowed me to add the extra space I needed for applications, and media to let me use the tablet the way I wanted, and not be limited to the available storage space of the C drive."
2.0,"Not what I expected, not enough instructions."
1.0,"the spot where the charger goes in broke in less than 2 weeks.. I brought it for a 7 year old, so now it wont charge and she is disappointed and so am I"
4.0,"My second drive of the same type, but with a larger capacity now. Both work very well for at least 3 years now. I use it routinely to backup/store very important data at work and precious photos at home."
3.0,Takes a long time to charge..no clue why but it does. Took over night to get my battery up to charge. I thought that was on the first charge but it is still doing it. Not a big deal because the tablet stays home but annoying non the less.
5.0,Exactly as described. Price and quality is perfect.
5.0,i have this in  my go pro hero 3 black.  works good hold a ton of videos and pics.  fair price after shopping around thanks prime!  this is the maximum the go pro can take so have at it!
1.0,"substantial lag between pen position and actual lines. distance of lag changes with the  angle of the pen. you need to use the pen straight up and down to get anything close to the accurate position. always a few pixels off. tested with Adobe apps, as well as Paper and Animation Creator. all had problems connecting, line lag, and positioning issues.<br />stick with the Jot Touch for now. this tech isn't ready yet."
4.0,Great product....however need improvement on cover finish..... Black cover scratches easily...
5.0,"seems to be working ok, still with this video card Ark is still glitchy at times.  but Ark is also still in Alpha."
5.0,"I use this in my Galaxy S3 so that I can carry all my MP3s that are on my iPOD classic (45GB).The only complaint I have is not with this unit, but with smartphones in general.  They are still to sensitive to be used as a true mp3 player replacement.  If you are not too careful, you may crack the screen on your phone if you try to use it as an all-purpose media player.My ipod classic is five years old and it has yet to have its screen crack on me.  It definitely hold up better at the gym than my phone.  Anyway, this SDXC card is great."
1.0,Sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there. My lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip.
4.0,This adapter does do what it is supposed to do.  Lightning took out the onboard ethernet so I replaced it with this wireless.  Would have given it a 5 except that it has dropped out a couple of time for no reason and has to be reset.
5.0,Works like a charm in my Galaxy Note 3.  I'm tired of getting bogus SD cards off another major auction house.
3.0,Underwhelming. I like it. Just not as much as an IBM.
1.0,"A huge mistake, the Table come with problem charging the baterry. Be carefull. It says Like New, but doesnt work well."
1.0,Didn't last long already broken
1.0,"the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything."
3.0,It's okey for the price. My wife uses it.
2.0,This fan works awesomely but the build quality is so cheap mine broke the day I got it so if your careful this is a great product
5.0,This card is high quality and a great price. It is not made for video but works well for photography and most other applications. Big enough to hold all your photos and songs. I use it as extra storage for my Galaxy Tab and works great. I would recommend it.
4.0,"The micro SD card was extremely fast.  Writing and read files were very fast even on a slow USB 2.0 interface.  Mechanically, the card is tight in the adapter.  Needs a screw driver to get it back out of the adapter.  Tried on another two adapters with the same results, tight fit.  If user plan to use this as a normal size SD card, it is an excellent card.  If one plan to switch between &#34;phone&#34; (micro SD card) and camera (normal size SD card), then the tight fit might be a problem.  Vender service was excellent.  shipment was faster than expected.  Would buy it again even with the tight fit.  It was an excellent value for a very fast card (camera can shoot burst mode without slowing down to write to card)."
1.0,"Disclaimer: First off, Amazon is honestly the best retailer known to man. I just want to clarify, my beef is not with Amazon at all, just Lenovo.<br /><br /> So, I purchased this computer. At first glance it was great! I installed all the stuff soon as I booted it up and was then prompted to install Windows 10. I used it for a couple days and it worked great! After a while, as soon as I signed in I would get an error message and the screen would turn blue and the computer would crash (The only sites I had visited at this time were youtube and facebook and I have anti virus software). I called Lenovo support for assistance, They informed me that my warranty expires in 3 months... I just purchased this laptop, brand new, and they said I have 3 months left on my 1 year warranty... Fine, whatever. The guy said it was a Windows 10 error  and that I needed to delete Windows 10 and use Windows 8. He said I could install Windows 10 later and install a patch. I wasn't interested considering what just happened and the fact I needed this for school. Finally my computer worked. Not 2 days later, I went on facebook and my friend posted a video on my timeline. I went to watch the video, boom, green screen. I could hear the video but the screen was green. I called Lenovo right away to utilize my (apparent 3 month warranty) The lady said it was an easy fix and she would have everything running in no time. She then proceeded to tell me that if I needed assistance I then needed to pay a service fee. I asked her &#34;Why would I pay a service fee for a brand new product I literally just purchased, that is not working?) She then proceeded to tell me that I could pay a one time service fee or sign up for a monthly subscription. Do not buy this laptop. If anything goes wrong with it, Lenovo customer service is worthless. If you like you can return it to Amazon within 30 days so long as its shipped by them and they can at least give you a full refund and they will even pay the shipping. But if you want a box that has nice computer parts but doesn't do anything and to have crappy customer service, purchase a Lenovo. The bad customer service may cost you an arm and a leg, but the headache comes for free! *Does two thumbs up and a sideways smile*"
1.0,very hard to work with windows 8/8.1.  I think the computer itself is very nice but it is hard for me to tell because I can't run windows and there was no offer of a free download of windows 10  I would like to have this option and try windows 10
5.0,"Hey, it's memory. Everybody needs it, and you can never have enough.And, as I'm always losing my memory, I have to keep plenty on hand and stashed away for a rainy day."
1.0,It's a good thing I bought 4 of these because 2 have broken already just from plugging them into my phone.
4.0,"I purchased this to use in a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It worked fine for about a month, then the phone stopped recognizing it. I was able to copy my photos before the computer stopped recognizing it as well. SanDisk replaced it under warranty and so far the new one has been fine."
2.0,"I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!  If it says ""Class 10"", it should be somewhat close to the Class 10 spec.I'm returning them."
2.0,Only lasted a year and now the kindle store option wont work. Wanted to be able to buy books on it but now cant do that. Resolution is also poor.
4.0,This is a great case.  It's cute and durable too.  The only thing we've had trouble with is that it doesn't stand up all that well how it is shown in the pictures.
3.0,Thanks
4.0,Easy to Install.  Fits perfectly.  A little flimsy with the material but OK.
3.0,Works fine mines arrived with the usb power cable broken It was very cheap quality But after repalcing the cable with another one it worked fine
3.0,Heavier than I like and minimum storage area underneath.
1.0,"if i could give this zero stars, i would. 2/3 just plain don't work at all straight out of the box, and one of them works only periodically. 100% crap. i can honestly say this was a waste of money."
5.0,"Very, very good and reliable.  Use it in my Win8 tablet, so I don't take it out a lot, but when I do, it seems to work fine in other places.  I bought it a while ago, and it's never failed.  I would recommend it."
4.0,It works well.
3.0,"Buy the one with &#34;two&#34; brightness levels instead of this one,"
3.0,It's ok. You must open the case to plug it in (no cutout for the cord). The pen holder ripped out right away but no big loss there. I would have preferred a backlit keyboard option and multiple viewing angles would have been nice. The overall look is fine and it should provide enough protection for everyday use. I may have rated it higher if I didn't own a Belkin QODE Ultimate Pro for my iPad. It's more expensive but alas they don't make one for the Samsung.
2.0,Advertised to fit 7&#34; tablet but corner straps too loose. However swivel feature is a good design.
3.0,"Pros:<br />Aesthetics are on point<br />Fits a larger hand (I wear a LG-XL glove)<br />Extensive customization options for performance<br /><br />Cons:<br />One of the side buttons doesn't work properly*<br /><br />*This is merely a flaw in this particular mouse. As I try to adjust the volume on my computer by using the 'Easy-Shift' + Scroll wheel, the button won't respond most of the time"
4.0,Great product at a fair price
4.0,"older than I expected, but it works great"
2.0,The openings do not line up with the iPad so the camera lens is partially covered with the plastic cover and the volume buttons are partially covered and sometimes just start to adjust if slightly touched. The actual fit is fine and the quality seems fine too so far but the biggest downfall is the alignment of the openings on the case vs the iPad.
3.0,Gets hot fast. Gets cranky when you pull the power (on accident since it requires and external power source) and try to plug it back in.
5.0,"originally bought a case with a keyboard, but it don't allow me to use the camera while in the case. however, this case fits perfect;y."
1.0,Operated fone for about 2 days. Then wouldn't charge over 2% and when off AC cord shut down after 5min use. Not a good product.
3.0,"I do not get the advertised speed of 30MB/s, more like a 200-300KB/s on my Galaxy S4. At least it gives me a lot of extra storage space, for a phone it works nicely if you don't need to transfer big files."
2.0,I think the battery was used. It doesn't work that great.
2.0,Ports stopped working so I had to return it. Easy return process!
2.0,"Worked very well for a few day. A FEW DAYS. Not weeks, not months, have to keep it plugged in juuuuuuust right or sound cuts out just a few days after purchase. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this one."
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
5.0,"Nice addition for a Roku player or tablet. I believe this came with a SD adapter, so you can plug it into an SD card slot on your computer or other SD device."
3.0,The top left seam broke the first time I slid in my tablet. But I was able to fix it easily and completely using Loc-Tite superglue. Am very pleased with the Bluetooth keyboard and overall product value.
3.0,"Sounds great, The wiring is RCA type and solid into the speaker. The older logitech I had used speaker clips I didn't like as is would damage the wire before moving the speaker when bumped. I also like having volume control on the front speaker instead of a remote. The bass control is on the back of the sub which would of been better next to volume.<br />Edit After testing I discovered the speaker with volume control distorts on certain sounds even at low volume. The rest are perfect :/"
5.0,"Installed one in both mine and my Wife's Galaxy S IIII phones, and am a happy camper! Now we have to learn how to use them properly."
2.0,I could not make this bootable. Wanted it for Linux.
3.0,Still an issue with reflection when<br /> Outside.
1.0,I bought 2 and one of them stopped working after getting really hot to the touch about 2 weeks later.
3.0,It is a battery - What do you expect. It is suppose to work it did. It looks like a battery and fit into my computer. Did just what I expected it to do.
3.0,great price and product arrived on time thank you
4.0,It works for its price. Can't complain.
3.0,"According specifications should work on my laptop, but sometimes turns off, it must be that this battery is not for my laptop"
5.0,"Glad I purchased this item for use with my Samsung Galaxy s3, Im able to record video in HD or store almost anything you'd wanna have on your cell phone or etc.."
1.0,"Bought an exact model from Costco a week ago for my wife for her school work with high expectation. Since her grad school has not started, she only played with it after work to get herself familiar with Windows 10. This Saturday morning she noticed the laptop screen was flickering, and I confirmed it as I sat watching the screen for a while. The rate of screen flickering seems to increase as time goes by. I will have to return it and look for another laptop while my wife's school starts next week. I am very disapointed with Dell's quality. I am restoring the system now. All the hours of installing software apps are wasted."
1.0,Dont waste your money!!
5.0,Fit my macbook air and my husband's macbook pro perfectly.
