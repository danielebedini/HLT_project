5.0,"I got my memory card here instead of on the gopro site and saved some money. Its the same card and it works awesome. This card is about 7 hours of 720 @30 frames per second, or about 4 hours of 720@60 frames or 1080 @30 frames. In a gopro, you will be burning through batteries way before you could ever fill these cards. I prefer more, smaller cards. If a card dies, it is less of a catastrophe and you also dont pay that premium for the larger cards. However, If I do a LONG time lapse with a battery source, having a large card is nice to have."
1.0,"This power adapter does not meet Apple standards; when you plug in your MacBook the power surge causes the the track pad to malfunction (though there seems to be no permanent damage; MacBook works normally again when unplugged). See the fifth bullet point in this article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203171  Moreover, the seller was unresponsive to my request for a replacement/refund. Bad product, non-existent customer service. Don't buy this."
1.0,"I bought this Portable DVD Writer which is supposed to be compatible with Windows 8 in May 2015.  I can get it to work just fine with Windows 7 but for some reason, it won't work with Windows 8 to download music from CD's into iTunes.  If you advertise that it is supposed to be Windows 8 compatible it should work with Windows 8.  I even downloaded the latest hardware version from Samsung but still can't get it to work.  I recommend you look elsewhere for a DVD Writer/Reader based on my experience."
2.0,I charged this tablet to 100% but then only get like 1 hour of battery life before it goes dead. The specs said 6 hours of battery life.
4.0,The adapter words good.
1.0,disconnects every 10 or so minutes.  worked well for a month or two.  now i have to buy a new keyboard :(
3.0,"No works with toshiba satellite s55t-b model. Not covers the entire screen size, only covers the viewable area."
1.0,"I bought this card on the strength of the 64GB XDSC SanDisk in my phone right now.  It was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first use.Initially it worked fine, then dead.  We checked in a laptop and Windows Disk Management screen told me it had a single 128K partition and the rest was unusable.  Outstanding.The replacement sent by Amazon (Thank you Amazon, you are always excellent) is sitting in my office right now, I should probably check it out."
1.0,keyboard didn't work.  Returned it.
3.0,"Actually the item probably worked better than I'm giving it credit for, but, not being a Bluetooth guy, the instructions could use a little work.  Once I got it up and running, everything was great.  I have a keyboard for my Kindle and I still use the screen as my mouse."
3.0,It worked with no problems for a year and yesterday it stopped working.  It was able to connect to the cable company but unable to connect to the modem over ethernet.  I got another cable modem to make sure that it was the modem and the other modem worked fine.
4.0,Works better than expected
1.0,Recieved a MiniUSB adapter instead of a MicroUSB adapter. Wrong item in packages.
5.0,"Bought this for my sons tablet, and it works fine. Sandisk has always been the leader in these flash memory cards, and has always been well worth the money."
3.0,Several problems with this unit. In terms of overall performance it works just good.<br />Touch pad just got broken few months after I bought it. Charger AC cable also got damaged within few days after bought.<br />2 (out of 3) USB ports also gave massive problems while one doesn't work at all the another work at random times.<br />One of the hinge protector got loose finally got removed from it's original position and once it fall from it's bay never fit back. This make the cover close unpaired and display gets a strange way to fit with when closed and open positions.<br />Still LOVE this pc. With all these loses is a great computer.
1.0,The damn thing died.  It died in like 2 weeks.  The replacement died just as fast.  This is bad and Sony should feel bad.
1.0,My son has had this headset for about a month and they broke. Very disappointed.
2.0,Very difficult to install!
1.0,"This is the worst computer I have ever used. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. I purchased the laptop at Frys, the Internet Explorer and WiFi didn't work so I returned it within one week. The techs there were not able to fix it and gave me a new one. The new one is also not working properly. The Internet Explorer and wifi also do not work. I contacted Frys who refused to replace it and told me to contact Acer directly. I contacted Acer requesting a refund. They refused to do so. I was on the phone for 1 hour with them, got terrible customer service and no resolution. They told me to mail in my laptop at my own expense. I am an independent contractor and need my laptop to work. I told the customer service rep this and she told me to borrow a family member's computer. This is not a solution. The end result: I have to mail in the laptop, wait for them to look at it and try to repair it. Since Frys was unable to fix the first lemon, I doubt they will be able to fix this one. I wasted $1400, not including the software I purchased for the laptop."
5.0,"Works well in my Galaxy Note II.  I've bought many Sandisk memory cards and never experienced a failure, even the 256MB SD card purchased for a Palm Pilot still works."
3.0,"I purchased this item a few days ago and it was easy enough to setup by logging thru its web tool menu. www.tprepeater.net<br /><br />I was hoping that it would provide better 5GHz coverage (compared to another range extender such as Netgear AC750 EX6100) but it did not.<br /><br />You really have to be at least between 10-15 feet in order to get good AND consistent signal.  Any further you begin to lose signal or get disconnected.<br /><br />The 2.4GHz signal and coverage fared better.  I tested it by putting it on the 2nd Floor and situating myself on the 1st Floor and vice versa.<br /><br />This was tested using Verizon FiOS 75/75 Mbps service and connected thru an AC1200 Dual Band Gigabit router.<br /><br />My irritation with this product is that there is no way to 'Hide the SSID' feature unlike the Netgear AC750 EX6100 range extender or others out there.  So beware of those prying eyes and WiFi piggybackers and freeloaders!  It does provide the maximum security available WPA2.<br /><br />I emailed TP-Link Technical Support and received this response:<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />Thank you very much for your email requesting information about our product.<br /><br />I am sorry to tell you that RE210 does not support hide the SSID currently. We may have plan to fix it in the future.<br /><br />If you need any further help, please feel free to let us know.<br /><br />&#62;How do I hide the SSID on TP-Link AC750 Extender RE210?<br /><br />Best Regards<br />----------------------------------------------<br />P**** T****<br />TP-LINK Technical Support<br />Website: http://www.tp-link.com<br /><br />So there you go.  I may have to switch this product with something else because I'm not sacrificing security over waiting whether or not they'll release an update and for it to receive the new firmware.<br /><br />I have not tested the Gigabit port as I am using it purely as an extender/repeater. I'll post an update if we end up using it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I bought this product upon reading reviews and recommedations of its current users.  It is also designed compactly, non-intrusive with other outlets and it seemed to be well-priced.<br /><br />I wish TP-Link would've considered all the other features that most AC750 range extenders have.  Not having the 'Hide SSID' feature was a big miss for TP-Link.priced.  I wish TP-Link would've considered all the other features that most AC750 range extenders have.

5.0,"Packaging very secure, product is absolutely legitimate Sandisk card.29.7 GB available storage.[Normal for 32GB card] Amazon comes through again!Speed unknown, works fine in all my **stuff**..Addenda 9-19-13: Two received and working perfectly. The loss of 2.3 GB(32 to 29.7)explained by the data added when formatting the chip.  Seemsto be a legitimate 10 speed. VERY good MicroSDHC! The best!"
2.0,The pad is rolled up inside the packaging.  Even after weeks of use it never fully flattens out.  Annoying to use.  Unfortunate because it is otherwise of good quality.  Packaging this flat would fix the problem.  Or use a thinner material that flattens out.
2.0,"I had the 1st Kindle Fire and was very happy with until I broke it. I got the basic model, which was smaller than the original but cost more. I think charging so you don't have ads was dumb and I refused to pay for it. Other than a camera I saw no real improvements."
1.0,"I started to leave a negative review of this laptop when it froze completely. It does this EVERY day without fail! So I suppose there is a method to Acer's madness. Can't leave a bad review when your PC doesn't work. The mouse pad is also horrible, sometimes it will take you in the vicinity of where you want to click but only when it feels like it. I could go on...Suffice it to say I will never buy another Acer product again. It's a piece of ju You'd never be able to use it for work or school because it's so unreliable. Extremely frustrating."
2.0,Sadly it just doesn't fit well. It's as if it's a bit too small. So you end up with raised lips around some letters. Stretching it around keys works but only temporarily until you type and the silicon pops off.
4.0,The mouse looked awesome and well constructed. It did not have LED lights as mentioned so we had to return it.I gave it four stars instead of five because of no lights would have gave it another star had it had them.
3.0,It only lasted a week. It seems that USB 3.0 drives have a reliability issue...
2.0,Great but can not remove the sticker gum from #3..the third step....afraid to use Goof Off
5.0,This product has excellent quality! No problems so far. Fast reading and data transferring. I love it! Taking pictures like crazy without any worries. Reliable product indeed.
5.0,Excellent !!
4.0,"I use this to switch between my Mac's internal mic and my headset's external one. I do an internet radio show to hook up with the Skype-like (not Skype) connection Blog Talk Radio uses. Otherwise, pre-show, I have to completely shut my computer down, plug in the headset and reboot in order to switch to the external headset and mic. (And then, again, to switch back after the show. It's a huge pain.)<br /><br />This unit takes care of that problem. But that's all I use it for and half the time I just use my iPhone and Bluetooth headset/mic because it still fails at least half the time. Honestly, I don't know if it's the station of the Belkin product that's the problem. It's probably the station because I use Skype all day every day in my work and can switch between headset and &#34;regular&#34; without any rigamarole.<br /><br />So - I'm pretty sure this does what I need it to, but I did have to fiddle with it quite a bit. It could use longer cords and it would be nice if it came with a power adapter."
1.0,The top cover doesn't fit can't get it to stay on
3.0,"The case is nice looking and fits well but my gripe is that the opening for the headphone jack is pretty small.  You need to make sure your headphones have a straight, slim profile around the jack otherwise they wont plug in all the way. The Apple headphones work fine, but others with a thicker surround for the jack, or an L-shaped connector, won't work properly."
3.0,just another way to spend money.
5.0,"I love the color, size, apps and everything about it."
2.0,You should only purchase this if you have no desire for a kickstand.  Ours broke in about 2 days.  I will say that the case is great and does what it is supposed to do but without the kickstand it's worthless.  So off I go to find another....
4.0,Works fine.
1.0,"I was REALLY looking forward to using this box to transfer old video tapes to a digital format.  I really liked the idea that with this unit, the user had the opportunity to pick among three different file formats for recording, and that it could handle High Def.  After following the directions and setting it up, I was extremely disappointed in the fact that the video that was recorded stuttered, paused, froze, and every other which way but straight, uninterrupted video clips.  Mind you, I tried it with TWO different computers, both exceeding the minimum recommendations listed with the unit.  One computer was an i5 laptop with 6 GB of RAM; the other was a VERY robust machine with an i7 quad processor and 32 GB of RAM!  I REALLY wanted this unit to work, as there is nothing else out there that has what this unit boasts of having.  I returned it to Amazon, and purchased another product for about $100 less, which worked flawlessly at importing the video that I fed from my VCRs to the computer (the laptop, actually).  Perhaps the Hauppauge unit that I received was defective; I don't know....  I didn't exchange it to find out.  And evidently, it has worked well for others -- I am only reporting my personal experience here."
2.0,Microsoft as of 08-30-15 have NOT updated the drivers for this cam for use with Windows 10...... so sad
5.0,"Have had this card for months, and used it on a Sansa Clip+, LG Optimus One (P500h), LG G (E970), Asus MeMO Pad, and of course on a whole lot of readers for PC."
2.0,Delaminates after 6 months. Pleather came off plastic.
2.0,"I've had the iBenzer case for about two months, ever since I bought my Macbook. In that two months the case is cracked and shattered in multiple places and has chipped in several places as well. Not high quality at all and probably won't last for another month through college."
4.0,Great quality; beautiful vibrant colors.
2.0,"Haven,t really gotten into working on it yet . Will review and work on it v later when in the mood for dealing.<br />With it. My H G 6 fire."
1.0,No good
5.0,I use this in my Galaxy Note 3 and seems to work just fine.  I love having lots of memory and the price was good.
4.0,Works as advertised.
5.0,"Since my wireless carrier didn't sell a S4 version with more than 16gb of memory, I wanted something to add a bit more storage space to my phone. Got this on sale for $42.99 and I couldn't be happier with how it performs so far."
2.0,"Mouse is okay, keyboard is like a toy."
3.0,"Quick review! Works well with livesceibw 3. If your hard on ur notebooks (covers get destroyed or damaged) or will be taking your notebook places with you and taking it in and out of the bag this isn't for you. This is because there are no features that increase the durability of the book. But if you plan on note moving this book much(ie keep it stationary on a desk not taking it places it will work) then it should work fine.<br /><br />Indepth Review!<br />Its great works well has all the special elements that are needed for use with the livescribe. Pages are nice quality and no other complaints about problems working with the livescribe 3 pen.<br /><br />BUT the front cover isn't plastic like 5 star notebooks. If you are using at at highschool where it won't going in and out of a bag multiple times a day it should be fine. But the flimsy multi layered cover is crap (it's thinner then the normal paper cardboard back covers on cheap notebooks) and isn't durable. So if you are taking it in and out of a bag multiple times or throwing it in a locker it's going to show wear after the first you. After a less than a week the layers at the edge start coming apart (outer most layers sorta curl up). After two weeks you will most likely see wear by the coil binding.<br />Because of this I would not purchase this again. I'm looking into single subject notebooks that can fit in a portfolio or getting the loose leaf sheets printed and have holes punched in the pages so it fits in those notebooks where u can add and remove pages/tabs/folders. I believ this to be a much better option costs wise and durability wise! Less chance of notes getting destroyed. The other option I'm considering  for next semester is using a single subject in a portfolio and swap the notebooks (but that's not convenient when I have multiple classes in a row.<br /><br />The loose leaf placed in those personalizable notebooks give me many  options . Such the ability to rearrange my notes, add pages where needed, and organize my notes better by sectioning it with dividers and all.<br /><br />However I have looked into ways of protecting this notebook from wear and tear but haven't found many options. What I decided on was contact paper lining the front and back cover this protects the outermost edges but I couldn't figure out a way to protect the holes where the metal binding goes through. I extended the contact paper past the edge to give it a lip for two reasons. First any damage would happen to the contact paper first since that part isn't attached directly onto the book. Second is because some of the pages of the note book were starting to show wear from the pages sliding on the binding. think of how a binders edge is wider then the paper so it protects them or a thick hardcover book. The cover is usually at least a cm larger then the pages so that it provides extra protect from the pages of the cover slides slight to the side. I tried to show how much the actual pages you take notes on are exposed when the cover slightly shift. I also showed how the extra cm I added to the notebook with the contact paper acts to protect the pages. So far it's working. I will update through out the semester with how it's doing."
4.0,Very good keyboard for the price. Watch out for the elusive enter key though. I'll miskey / instead of enter every now and then
2.0,It got damaged after a few months of use. What a piece of trash
1.0,"I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this one really deserves it. So, in hopes of saving some of you a little time and effort...do not buy this tablet! I'm no techie, so I spent A LOT of time looking into many different tablets and their functions, and after reading hundreds of reviews on different items, decided to purchase this NeuTab for my little person. My expectations were realistic, as I was looking for something to basically do homework, watch videos, and play games on.<br />So I powered this thing up, which came 100% charged (bonus), and right away noticed the not so great screen image. Read this in other reviews, so no surprise. But it was all downhill from there. It took at least 10 minutes to load some basic apps. Also there were three personal pictures on the tablet that looked like the inside of someones home in Asia, so I'm thinking this may have been a refurbished unit. Lastly, after turning this thing on only twice, it never powered up again, whuch meant I actually got to use it for less than an hour. Luckily, the return was super easy.<br /><br />Ended up spending a few more dollars for a smaller, but way better Samsung tablet. Save yourself some time and do the same."
1.0,"I was taking a tour in Hangzhou China and while I was shooting with my Canon 6D, the card out of sudden crashed. My camera won't recognize the card and it showed ""card reading error"". I had more than 2000 photos in it including the trip in Beijing and Xi'an. I was not able to cover those photos even with the common flash memory recovery softwares. I may have to send it to Sandisk subdivision LC Technologies to recover those photos, for the 64 gb they are asking for $325, regardless how much photos they can recover.Lesson learned: for important shoots, use 32 SDHC card, they are so far the most stable SD cards out there. I spent over $10K for this vacation and most of these valuable memories are gone. Thanks a lot Sandisk! I wish I could give negative stars if Amazon allowed me to."
2.0,"I bought this in January 2015. It worked pretty well for me and I was pleased with it (with occasional problems with key repeats, and a connection delay of about 3 seconds every time you start to use it, but whatever). As of 2 weeks ago, 2 areas of the keyboard no longer work (ZXCVNM,./ and the Enter and backslash key). There was no dropping or spilling on the keyboard event. I carry it with me, but nothing out of the ordinary happened. Seems like it should last more than 7 months."
1.0,"Kindle arrived, but software is not working properly. I can't open the start menu once I have opened a book, so it's impossible to return to Home screen (I have to open the dictionary abd from there go to Home). I tried reading the manual, but it wasn't very helpful because it referred to butttons that the device doesn't have. I imagine this device has the wrong software. I will contact Amazon to see if they can fix this."
1.0,I spent 2 hours conversing with Amazon.  This is the second 6 inch Kindle Fire I have returned.  I will never buy another or recommend a kindle.  I have never had this many problems Registering a Kindle.
5.0,Very Good!!
4.0,This is a very fast and reliable microSD card.  I used this on my Galaxy Note 2 and loaded movies and family pictures.  Transfer time is speedy!
2.0,This remote worked for like 1 month then it messed up and keeps disconnecting the p3 remotes for around $9.99 are better
5.0,"Very nice upgrade for my phone, gives it plenty of space for allot of games. and if you wondering yes this is compatible with a Samsung galaxy s4."
1.0,If you are an Apple user get away from this product.
1.0,"Was a really bad idea bought this product, this tablet got crazy and dosen't let you do anything."
3.0,"It is good, but I cannot get volume loud so I never know when I get messages or I cannot use my alarm."
4.0,No problems.
2.0,I bought it for my mom. She thought and still thinks it's cute. It may be just a defective case. Most of the time it stays awake when the case is closed. It was a easy to go to setting & let the iPad go into sleep mode after nonuse after 2 minutes or even other times but I shouldn't of even had to since that was one of its  features. My other complaint is that it just looks like it was cheaply made & I'll be buying another one a lot sooner that I should of.
5.0,"Works, had to give a review of this since it does exactly what is it advertised to! Good buy for anyone!"
3.0,Everything was great except the hard drive space is much too small. I need a small back up DJ music computer but this past all tests except hard drive.
4.0,I have used this with Sony camcorder for more than a year now. It works well and copes with the high data volume of a camcorder video.
3.0,"its a decent headset, my only issues is that certain programs that are outputting audio are not being handled correctly by the provided soundcard. for example. i play a game called league of legends, and whatever sounds it doesnt know what to do with, it will just send them to the right ear only. this goes as well for games like saints for 4, lucius, path of exile, etc. umm, as far as sound quality goes, it takes a while to tweak around with the EQ, but once you get your preference, it doesnt sound as s***ty out of the box.    tip: do not have your surround sound enabled for music rhythm games such as osu!. it will lower volumes at random points, you will have to disable surround sound.    but boy, this headset sure is comfortable, sometimes i forget im even wearing it. the earcups dont even touch my ear. just around them.    cable is perfect length. thing about the inline cable controls is that the mute switch is kinda hard to push up or down.    the software was easy to install.    id give this headset a 9/11"
4.0,"For the cost, this is nice.  It feels just like the full blown windows and it's free to activate the windows license.  I surf the web and run GoToMyPC to grab other computers in the house.  It struggles with 1080 video streaming and it can't play 2D/3D games very well, but if you are using it for GoToMyPC and web surfing, it's great."
1.0,2 Days later it broke
3.0,"Only two of the ports are &#34;powered&#34;, and so only these can be used to charge a phone or tablet. The other four ports are only handy when helpful when attached to a computer.  Mostly useful when used as a way of having multiple ports for a computer."
3.0,Too sensitive for me...
4.0,I have been very happy with this purchase. The keyboard is easy to use.
5.0,Good value for the money. Performs like a SanDisk and with the piece of mind it won't fail.
5.0,what can I say it's a memory card okay it is fast and compatible good quality perfect perfect perfect perfect
3.0,"Among the many PCIe eSATA cards I've purchased so far this one is the most compatible with external RAID enclosures, able to recognize 8 drives over a single cable with port multiplier and transfer to them at reasonable sustained speeds. That's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news is that if your PC is under heavy CPU load, the driver for this card can cause a blue-screen crash that shuts down the PC (it is a fairly rare crash and may take up to 25 minutes of sustained heavy CPU load before it triggers). For this reason I've had it disabled for some time in my PC. I'm hoping the new 4 Channel Vantec might have less crappy drivers."
3.0,"unnecessary, but still okay to buy"
4.0,"I really like this case, i needed a case that would protect my macbook air incase i ever dropped it and this case snaps on easily and is very secure. At first i thought the keyboard cover  was ripped or messed up but then i realized it was just stuck to itself a little. The letters on the keyboard cover dont quite match the apple keyboard but it is not noticeable unless you light up the keyboard. Also the sound is just the slightest of muffeled when i have the keyboard cover on. Ive had this case for a couple months now and have never dropped it but one day noticed that the corner where it clips on was slightly cracked and over time the crack grew until finally a piece fell off (as shown in picture) and now it doesnt quite fit securely as it did before but still works very good and i still love it and am glad that i got it.<br />(1st pic) back side where it first started cracking<br />(2nd pic) front side where the clip used to hold on to the front side of the computer"
5.0,"We have 3 of these and so far it is my favorite microsd card, fast and so far no problems."
5.0,"I only buy SanDisk and this item like all the others I have purchased, worked perfectly the first time.  Love it!"
3.0,"I do not know if the GS3's have issues with reading cards of this size but I eventually had to remove this card and purchase a Transcend 8GB Class 10 card just to check if it was my phone that was the problem. When I got it I opened the packet, and popped it right in. Recognized, was able to start using, taking shots and video and they immediately saved to the card without the hangup my old class 2 card used to have. After a couple of days I noticed that I would take a shot and the phone would give me an error that it could not save to the SD card. You would have to reboot to fix. When scrolling through the gallery on the SD card it would freeze and the app would crash. I moved what I could, formatted the card but the same thing kept happening.Since installing the new Transcend 8GB card I've had no such issues. Maybe its just MY phone but I think there have been enough complaints from GS3 owners to be a little skeptical about this card on their phones."
4.0,"There are a number of MicroSD manufacturers out there that offer large capacity cards like this. They claim to be Class 10 but when tested, prove to be closer to Class 6 cards in performance. This SanDisk card performs at the Class 10 level.I use these cards in various devices that NEED Class 10 speeds, such as my Android phone because of the data transfers I do for work and for the games I keep on it.If your device does not need Class 10 (you are just using it for simple storage of basic files like docs or ebooks) then you could probably save some money by going with Class 6. If the prices are very close, then you might as well spend the extra money and get Class 10.This card came with a nice plastic storage case and a SD adapter. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel the prices should be a lot lower by now. Inventory is plentiful and these are not cutting edge tech any more."
5.0,Worked well for our aging MacBook.  :)  Increased performance.  Easy to install.  Very satisfied.
5.0,"I got this for my new Microsoft Surface Pro, just in case I needed more room. It comes with a adapter if needed and works great for more storage room."
2.0,"I've had it for 5 months and it's already history. Fails to hold the iPad securely, as many other reviews have noted. Now every time I use the touchscreen, the iPad falls out of the clips (you'll see what I mean in a few months of heavy use if you buy one). Makes it virtually useless, and embarrassing in meetings (as it will slap to the table, flattened, with a loud thud). Also, it appears to be scratching/marring the iPad screen, especially around the edges. Luckily this is a work device... if I paid for it myself, I'd be livid.<br /><br />Keyboard itself is great. Responsive, thin, and I type on it really well. A pleasure to use. Makes the fact that the overall design is flawed even more disappointing.<br /><br />Do not buy unless you don't mind replacing it in a few months, and keeping your screen free of scratches is not a priority. This is essentially an expensive, 3-6 month disposable keyboard cover that will actually damage your device."
1.0,"I expected that this would be faster and/or have a further reach than the old router. Overall, it's quite disappointing. Keeps kicking me off, folk stops and stutters. Wish I could return it but alas too late. Going in the garbage. Worse than the 3 year old router it replaced."
3.0,"Love the case. Very pretty and durable. The only complain that I have is that the lowest slot of the case will note hold the tablet well. The tablet kept slipping out of the slot. So, I don't use the lowest slot much."
4.0,"Good product, great for powering extra case fans. Great budget item!"
3.0,"Works as advertised, but it frequently becomes disconnected from its bluetooth paired computer.  Can require many tens of seconds to reconnect.  Very annoying.  Like the ability to switch among the machines I have."
1.0,"Junk !! Don't waste your money, defective battery's, only good for 3 days, I purchased 2 of them for two different notebooks, went bad at the same time, the seller doses not care, will not reach out and offer a refund. I wish I would have read the other reviews first..."
4.0,"I bought it for use with my MacBook Air at work. Have no problem so far after 3 years. I do a lot of image analysis on computer, hence a lot of mouse clickings to get fine measurement, and the mouse is very handy."
4.0,Exactly as shown the item is efficient and roomy for extras you want to carry with your iPad.
1.0,"It did not work at all. There is no other way to say it, it just does not work. I have no idea if it is just this one or if it is common. I can't tell you to buy or not to buy."
2.0,"Its nice as it is protective. I was just looking for a stand case and this sucks at standing up so I can set it down and watch something on it. I have other cases for my other tablets that I prefer better. I wish I can return, but they charge almost same price to send it back so no point."
4.0,I connected three separate cables to three separate couplers and it streams perfectly still! Definitely recommend.
1.0,"It stopped working. And since it says lifetime warranty, I tried contact Netgear, and they said they cannot offer warranty since I did not have the purchase receipt ( of course I did not and do not keep every store receipt for every product I purchase) even though I have the product with S/n, mac address...etc. I have attached a photo of the exact model number if it helps for anybody to not buy the same model.<br /><br />For benefit of doubt, Probably the one I got is defective, and everybody stores all the receipts of all the products ever bought."
2.0,"I think these mouse pads are very over rated. They slip all over the place on a wooden desk, the surface started fading within months. The most annoying part is the slipping around. I got a mouse pad from work that feels better than the Steel Series QcK pad."
4.0,not bad. save your money and get the 8350
4.0,"I do like and will order another, but it only holds up so long. This was my 2nd one. Doesn't stay propped up very well, but I can't find another that you can turn horizontal and vertical."
4.0,No problems with this micro SD. It works and works again. And then you know what? It works even again
5.0,Worth the $
2.0,"These worked great upon arrival, but after a couple (1-3) months of use, they stopped working."
2.0,"I got this for my Mac (2014 MacBook Pro) so that I could get movies, photos, etc off my Mac and onto this NAS drive. Well, for us Mac users this is not easy. I just spent about an hour and half sharing my screen and chatting with someone at QNAP because I was VERY frustrated about getting this to work as I envisioned it. Turns out it really only works well with Windows machines. For instance-I have 5 photo libraries (in my Photos app) and the biggest one has over 26,000 photos. I would need to export all of them and then drag and drop them all into the QNAP app. Ok. Will the metadata stay in tack? Will it automatically update when I add new photos? Not sure to the first and no to the second. The gentleman I spoke with had no idea what a Mac's setup is-he had no clue as to Photos and it's setup. That was what I learned-QNAP is not Mac friendly or intended to be used by Macs. Bottom line. My QNAP is working for Time Machine backups-that is good thing. I can put documents on it and access them anywhere. That's a good thing. But that's about it. Still trying to decide if I should return it... I have time invested in it. And money spent. I did tell him that that is what I have found out, that the QNAP is not made for Mac users and there is a large group of us out there and QNAP would do well to add a Mac guru to their staff. Just wanted to share my lesson learned with you...."
4.0,"A little bulky, but does the job! Still using it, and haven't had to replace since buying over a year ago."
2.0,slow internet speed
1.0,Looks good. Ships from Asia so you should expect 10-20 for it to be delivered.<br />I dump it right away cuz it does not stick to the keyboard at all. It was waste of money for me.
1.0,this is not a 13&#34; case as labeled. false advertisement.
2.0,"The magnetic keyboard doesn't stay put and after getting everything connected I had no wifi. Passed the return date, very dissapointed."
3.0,"I bought this for my MacBook Pro, and it fits but it's got an extra 2 inches on the side and inch on the top, so the laptop kinda slides around.  I ended up replacing this with one that fits better.  I don't recommend this product if you have a MacBook Pro.  I could see for bulky PC laptop's this would work though."
2.0,The tips of these things are very breakable everyone I've ever gotten from this<br />Site or in store usually ends up in the trash.
5.0,Works! Its a cord...
5.0,very happy with this case!
1.0,It doesn't even hold a full charge for my iPhone 6 six months after purchase
3.0,Seemed to work as advertised.  But my first one failed abruptly after one week.  My smartphone failed to &#34;see&#34; it.  But Amazon replaced it at no additional charge.  The second one is still working fine.  (My smartphone is a Samsung S4G.)
5.0,Works well in my GoPro even though it wasn't one of the GoPro recommended ones.  A good buy that has the speed for movies and big pictures.
1.0,wrong cable
3.0,Excelente
4.0,Good replacement. Didn't want touch screen but getting used to it. Works great though. very clear
2.0,"If you were looking for a class 10 microsd card in order to DIRECTLY transfer files from your PC to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class 4 instead of this one. The speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards I've had. It's very far from the 30mb/s they promise, I got only about 4.5mb/s AT MUCH, and after a few minutes it's downhill from there. I tested on both windows and linux and didn't see a difference. Luckily there's not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again, maybe I didn't look at the class 4 the way I should have since I was focused on getting a class 10. Oh well, you've been warned. Don't expect magic from this card.UPDATE 12/11/2013: Sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them. The reason I didn't contact them first it's because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help. It is indeed a waste of time. After sandisk comment I contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange. My suspicious were confirmed and I indeed wasted my time:Daniel S.: Hello, thank you for contacting SanDisk. My name is Daniel S.. Please give me a moment while I look into your question.fer da: heyfer da: i just got this answer from sandisk:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMA7XPN7IDZD/ref=cm_cd_notf_message?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=FxFNZEI17MH7ND&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=Tx7VKC9UPWNI9X#Mx3FKEEV0WIILE3Daniel S.: Please tell me what is written on the face of the memory card?fer da: never thought of contacting you because i thought i was just going to waste my time, but it was nice to be contacted proactively by youfer da: okfer da: the same thing as the one on the picturefer da: sandisk ultrafer da: microsdhc Ifer da: 32gbDaniel S.: Please allow me a moment.fer da: will you need more info from the card?Daniel S.: The Sandisk Ultra card is a UHS-I card and provides optimum performances when used with a UHS-I enabled device or card reader.fer da: my phone is off.. lolfer da: it says that it is a class 10 card, i bought it because of the promise of better speeds than the regular class 4 when using it with my phoneDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that you will get the minimum read speed of 10 mbps on a UHS-I enable device as the card is built on the UHS-I technology.fer da: and write speeds?fer da: i'm getting like 4mb/sfer da: a far cry from the 30 MB/s2 promisedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that so I said the card is built on the UHS-I technology it will give the optimum speed with an UHS-I enable device.Daniel S.: You will get the minimum write speed of 10 mbps with an UHS-I enable device.fer da: okfer da: waste of time confirmedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that if you'll use this card with an UHS-I enable device it will give you the optimum speed as it's promise.Daniel S.: Is there anything else I may assist you with?***removed one star because of the sliminess of contacting me via amazon to show ""sandisk cares"" but not really offering any real support when contacted."
2.0,"I bought it in July 2012. Haven't really used it much. It start to double click and also drag when i click the left mouse button after just a year of minimal use, but was too bothered to leave a review or to ask for a new one since i was working on Cruise Ships. Now i got pissed and i am leaving this review after 3 years. There. Not a good mouse at all. Too bad i spent those money on it. Shame Logitech. Shame. Shame."
2.0,"I edited my review because after a few months, the case fell apart."
1.0,"The keyboard arrived safely but sadly the full stop key does not function; this renders the keyboard entirely unusable.<br />Because of currency exchange reasons not viable to return item for credit, too costly."
1.0,"This MicroSDXC card and SD adapter came in what looks like a genuine Samsung package and both the card and reader do at first look like they are genuine Samsung devices. I did not receive a card reader, but I do not need it anyway. I had a lot of trouble inserting the card into the adapter. I attempted to transfer 64GB of files to the card several times and the data kept getting corrupted. The transfer speed to write the files to the card was very slow, and then some of the directories to which I copied the files were empty. Some of the files on the card were okay, and others were corrupted and would not open. I ran a flash card test on the card and it shows that it has only 8GB of memory. I have started the return process. Update: After doing much research, unfortunately I have verified that this is a fake 128GB card that is actually a hacked 8GB card. The controller firmware inside of the card has been modified to show 128GB. The font on the card is not the same font as shown on the Samsung website. (See the attached pictures.) The write speed is about 7MB/s, which is the speed of an SDHC card. The write speed for a typical SDXC card is about 40MB/s. I am using USB 3.0 for data transfer."
4.0,I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 when it was on sale. My fairly new internal card reader wasn't able to write to it so I tried 2 different USB adapters and they didn't work either. I installed it in my phone and was able to copy files via USB. It was slow but it worked and is great in the phone.
5.0,Battery fit and charge in my  modem with no issues.I recommend this product.  Have had for couple of months and it still works fine
3.0,seems to keep shutting off with Windows 8.1+
4.0,"This is an excellent masculine looking bag.  It holds my iPad Air, two smart phones and miscellaneous small items.  I'm happy I have it. Drawbacks: shoulder strap is a bit chinsey with no padding.  It would be nice to have a pouch on the side capable of holding a small umbrella."
1.0,"I used this to switch between a Linux and a Windows box. After a few month the Video Card in the Windows box became intermittent, and ultimately failed, while simultaneously the on-board video in the Linux box failed too! This switch is going in the trash, along with a damaged video card. I would recommend that you do not use it!"
1.0,included adapter does not work with the memory card. Boo.
2.0,"The wrist rest on this keyboard is not high/big enough, leaving your wrists bent too much to be ergonomic. Also, hate that it has the extra keypad which then requires your mouse to be very far to the right which is very bad ergonomics. Better off getting the Kinesis Freestyle. Best ergonomics I've found."
5.0,Exactly met the advertised features.  Quick delivery
4.0,"very powerful graphic card, a big step after using GTX 660 ti for 2 years, but still not the best"
5.0,"Works like a dream with my S3 smartphone, used for camera pics storage, videos and music; really enhances the capability and flexibility of any device with the slot."
5.0,I have it in my phone and it never skips a beat. File transfers are speedy and have not had any corruption issues or memory fade issues as I would expect from the Sandisk brand. Great card to own. Why entrust your precious files to a slightly cheaper piece of crap? If you lose everything can you forgive yourself for not spending the extra couple bucks on a trusted product that goes through good QA?
2.0,"It's basic and slow, it freezes a lot, the camera is very low quality, and think again if you assume that you will be able to download all of your favorite apps. I should have saved up for an iPad instead of jumping at an opportunity to purchase something cheaper - hence my headline. Also, the highest volume level is ridiculously low, which leaves the alarm completely useless. Oh, and there are nice advertisements to greet you almost every time you turn it on. I don't know why that bothers me so much, but it does.<br /><br />An all around disappointment."
2.0,"Worked fine for a month. Louder than the one I was replacing. Mostly functional, however occasionally cant recover from sleep mode properly."
2.0,DOes not hold a charge well.
3.0,"I liked the cover, and it's pretty much as described. I ordered the pink and it is pretty true to the color in the photo but there are a couple things I did not like. First of all I have the A1502 model and the keyboard cover is not exact with the actual keyboard which is disappointing. I would also like to add that the cover has a small iBenzer logo on the lower right corner of the top part of the case which is not featured in the pictures."
5.0,"I got this item for my dash cam which is in my convertible. The dash cam is recording at all times when I am driving my car so I needed a lot of memory. This card does the job for me and this brand name is fantastic, no problems, and works as it ought to!"
5.0,bought for garmin gps. works very well. also has adapter for sdhc size memory card to plug into reader if you don't have a micro card reader
5.0,Excellent Thank You..
1.0,Inexpensive but not recommended; connector to hook to charging cable is very fragile.
5.0,Not much to say other than it is as advertised and it works. I haven't the means to gauge the transfer speeds but I've experienced no lags or delays with the combination of this storage and my hardware (Galaxy Note II).The shipping was faster than anything I received recently.
5.0,My nephew loves it
1.0,The pictured/described unit is not what I received.  The picture and description are for a generation 2 device and I received a generation 1 device.
5.0,"An absolute steal. I have the monitor connected to a 13&#34; retina MacBook Pro, using SwitchResX to get 4k resolution at 52 hertz, which is more than smooth enough. I also hooked up a PS4, which looks great at 1080p using the built in game mode. The build quality is lower than an Apple Cinema Display, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it. The stand wobbles a bit but its virtually a nonissue.<br /><br />If I ever need another monitor, I'll buy another one of these."
2.0,"This keyboard has been a bit of a disappointment.  Based on the reviews here I was expecting better.  I haven't had any problems with it connecting or staying connected, and the dongle is behind my desk.  That being said, 1) there is no on/off switch on the keyboard and mouse like my Logitech set has, 2) the scroll wheel has no clicks and is completely erratic, no matter what I set it to, and 3) the function keys are way too small and hard to use.  The small function keys and non-clicking scroll wheel are the main reasons for the two-star rating.  I wish I had used this keyboard more before my 30-day return window was up - I would have sent it back.  I use the function keys a lot (e.g. F4 is repeat last formatting in MS Office, etc.).  I didn't think the smaller size would be an issue from the photos, but in actual use it is pretty annoying.  No click wheel on the mouse is enough for a two-star rating just by itself.  The behavior of the wheel is so bad it might as well not have a wheel.  It's completely erratic in every browser I've tried (IE, Firefox and Chrome).  That being said, the extra keys for volume, mail, etc. are nice, and worked with little or no configuration, which was nice.<br /><br />If you don't like a click-wheel on your mouse you should be ok, but if that's important to you skip this set."
3.0,"Alright the car fits over the tab, it was not made for a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch.  It covers the charging port and is hard to use the menu and back buttons.  Would've been a great Case if not for this."
3.0,"Didn't work. I'm happy with the price and the quantity; I fully expect something else will convert successfully.  I do not blame the manufacturer for this; it is just the way my computer recognizes a usb keyboard. I'll live. Thanks, Aleratec; you DID do a good job providing a good product."
3.0,No for gaming but may be for Photoshop. I have to return it but not because it was a  bad Graphic Card. My gaming PC needed something better or games will not perform as games requirements said.
1.0,"The case is great - but the cutouts don't fit the LG GPad 8.3 I got from Verizon just last month. If your speakers are on the same (L/R) side as the camera lens, it won't fit yours either. It's a shame, really."
3.0,"This tablet is just awesome in terms of size, resolution and features, as it's mentioned in other reviews.  However it comes preloaded with an older version of Android and there is no timeline of if or when it will ever be upgraded.  This means you could be putting your financial and online security at risk, as it doesn't contain the fixes and patches that the latest version of Android and other more recent tablet models would have."
5.0,"Used it in several camera models (D800, Nex-5N and HDR-AS15) all worked great with no issues. I am definitely thinking about getting a few more of these since Amazon has an unbeatable price."
1.0,"I have had this for 8 months, and the SD Card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures.  I have tried reformatting, and nothing helps.  Not cool.Update - April 2, 2014 - I contacted Sandisk and I am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement.  I hope this will resolve the issue with the card.  I will keep you updated once the process is complete."
1.0,Got this item and broke the next day. The usb piece went into my laptop and when I pulled it out half of it was stuck to my computer.<br /><br />Crappy item
1.0,NONE OF THEM WORKED...:(  HOW CAN I RETURN IT
2.0,Regret buying.
1.0,Performance and capacity were not in line with cost and expectations. These are most likely counterfeit or back door sales in my opinion. Very unsatisfied.
3.0,And you wouldn't believe what Sandisk put me through to get a warranty replacement.  However I finally got the replacement and it has been working fine ever since.
3.0,There was an area where the leather had peeled.  This may be due to the fact that this was the last piece.  Workmanship is inconsistant so one may be more lucky and end up with a nicer bag.  That being g siad the price is good and it will be functionwble as a laptop bag.
3.0,"Nice and bright lights, but no on/off switch. Easy to use... Plug in and go.Left front wheel kept falling off. Kept in place now by a small piece tape."
3.0,"I like this case a lot. But they have not actually planned on a standard ATX power supply. I used a standard PSU with the exhaust fan on top. Boy does this thing heat up. The case is a constant 110 degree F. I can place and hold my hand on it, but it is uncomfortable.<br /><br />I have emailed the manufacture and spoke with Amazon. Of course Amazon is awesome and willing to pay to ship it back. I'm hoping the manufacturer has some info for me in the next few days<br /><br />I am really disappointed as I was very excited for this build. I did cut my self on the 5.25 drive bay, but that's ok, I should have been more careful.<br /><br />3 stars for now, let's see how good customer service is."
4.0,"Great, excellent product as far as Dell PCs go... too bad I can't say the same about Windows 10 (my Wi Fi connection has been woefully unstable since I upgraded from Windows 8.1)"
4.0,"I couldn't put any files onto the card that were &#62;5 Gb. A little disappointing since I wanted to store movies on it, but I guess it's a limitation of the MicroSD HC technology."
2.0,"The picture was better looking than the real thing. The bag does not have enough external pockets for electronic gadgets. When I put all of them in the internal pockets, The bag bulky and hard to access these gadgets. What prompted me to return the bag was the fabric for pocket within the front zipper-compartment repeatedly got stuck with the zipper when I tried to zip it up, wasting a lot of time to gingerly remove the fabric out of the zipper. This would be bad at the airport security. Also, the fabric will eventually got torn and has a premature death."
4.0,"I bought three of these--one to replace my old 1 GB card and two for first-time users to add to their phone memory. These cards work fine, and none of the three had any trouble."
1.0,Will not hold charge already had to replace
1.0,its not support
4.0,"got it at a great price and it worked great, was a little upset with the tiny size of the packaging as i almost didnt even see it on my step, it arrived in a 1/4&#34; thick cardboard envelope that was about 3&#34; by 2&#34;."
4.0,"A pretty good mouse I like how easy it was to configure, and that theirs a button to lower and raise the sensitivity with a single button press. Only downside is I found the side buttons to be awkward to press down."
1.0,"Received wrong item, as far as I can tell. Package says B2-5094 VGA (M/M) which is accurate to what is in the package, just not what I ordered. The received items are for VGA connections, using 15 pins -- not 9 pins.<br />I am sure if I received the correct items I would be happy with them."
2.0,"The reason this router deserves two stars is because even after several months of availability the firmware still unstable. Features like readyshare and media server does not enforce password protection even if you set it to use password protection. Netgear Technical Support is extremely bad, specially if you are knowledgeable about networks and computers. Every question you make, they will put you on hold for 5 mins and then come with a dumb answer that will not fix the problem. This router is great for wireless connections and wired connections - but that's it! Don't try QoS or Dynamic QoS, Password Protection Folder Sharing, Access Control, or any other advanced feature, because it will not work or it will cause router issues like reboots or freezes. Hardware-wise its a great piece of technology but software-wise Netgear needs to start to develop software with QUALITY! I have until Sept 17th until Netgear fixes these issues. I'm using firmware V1.0.2.46_1.0.97  (Which I had to manually update by downloading the firmware from Netgear's support page) because the update feature of the router would not find the new firmware.)<br />If by Sep 17th Netgear do not at least give me a roadmap where these features will be fixed I will return this router and try D-Link."
2.0,"When I bought this for my daughter, I knew it wasn't going to compare to a kindle or iPad.  That being said, this isn't ever up to my mediocre standards. I wanted something that my 10 yr old could occasionally play games on & contact relatives.  The camera quality is horrible.  I should have listened more to other reviews concerning battery life....this tablet is constantly plugged in but always needs charging!  If you run the battery under 30%, it literally takes hours to recharge.  Extremely disappointed."
4.0,"Great overall, just doesn't go on perfectly, no matter how hard you try, there's always something wrong (bubble, crease, etc.)"
5.0,My wife loved it and me too because she take all the pictures and movies that want make and I don't need all the time ti pick out from the tablete.
2.0,"It obscures the screen but doesn't really work very well for privacy, at angles from 60˚ up to 90˚ you can still see what's on the screen, not as clearly but it can be seen. On a MBP Retina it also blurs slightly the screen."
2.0,the cord charges my phone but only at the right angle. its like having my old worn out charger back....
4.0,"Fits device snugly, and appears to provide adequate protection from scratches."
1.0,This product has not worked since I got it. It doesn't accept charge and will not turn on.
4.0,"UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER:<br />I bought two of these machines a year ago.... both of them have slowed down more and more as we've added applications to them as as time has gone by. One of the issues I see on both of them is that the hard disks seem very slow -- and show 100% hard disk utilization always under task manager. I have scanned for viruses on both machines and they are clean, and have run a number of troubleshooting steps. For basic work they are fine, but I would not buy this machine a year later... I think the disk transfer speed is underpowered for the processor and the memory. I also wonder if the drivers / etc (updated) have really been optimized for Windows 10.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I just bought one of these machines and liked it enough that I bought a second one for our house.  I bought it from the &#34;big blue electronics store with the yellow sign&#34; that rhymes with &#34;Test Try&#34; and it's usually on sale for either 549 dollars (best) or 579 so shop around.<br /><br />This won't be a review of Windows 10- though it works very well on this machine and discovery / installation of printers etc was immediate and seamless.  One issue I did have with both machines I bought is during the initial setup before updates are downloaded, the screen started flashing rainbow colors and I couldn't see anything except the colors.  With one machine I simply shut down and rebooted, and it then worked from then on, presumably after it loaded some updated video drivers, but with the other machine I was still in the middle of initial login account setup and turning off the machine actually crashed windows... I had to restore from a recovery disk I had created on the other machine.  So advice here is go through the setup screens as quickly as possible just to get a working account you can use to log in.<br /><br />Overall this is a good desktop that handles our word processing, email, internet and video playing just fine without stuttering or freezing.  Initial startup is about the same speed as Windows 7, contrary to what is claimed in the Windows 10 literature, and there seems to be a fair amount of startup activities once you do get to the desktop, even though I have disabled or delayed all but the essential ones.  After about 3 minutes at the desktop everything is loaded and speed is incredibly responsive -- for example Chrome and Word load almost immediately.<br /><br />With Windows 10 task manager you can see in much more detail where the bottlenecks are on a system and whenever it's slowing down I can see the bottleneck is the disk reading / writing, which will show 100% utilization.  Rarely does the CPU or memory column show high utilization... it is almost always the disk.  Too bad Dell hasn't figured out a way to speed up disk read / write (or go to SSD's) though I'm guessing price point plays a role here.  The CPU is super powerful and there's tons of memory so those are under-utilized most of the time unless I'm working with video, and even then no real issues.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - this is the fastest computer we've owned with the best operating system, but you don't read these reviews to see all the good things, you can see those in the advertisements, I'm just trying to warn about some of the drawbacks.  But I liked it enough that I bought a second unit so that should tell you something.<br /><br />The computer comes with a standard Dell chiclet-style keyboard and an inexpensive laser mouse.  I put both of them in the closet and am using my own.<br /><br />Here are my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Powerful computer for this price point, once initial startup items load it's blazing fast<br />+ USB 3.0 ports (2) located in back of unit (wish one were in front, or better yet all usb 3.0)<br />+ Super quiet, can't even tell it's on<br />+ Good support - I've contacted Dell twice and have been pleased with the ease of interacting with them (vs HP)<br />+ Works seamlessly with Windows 10 - even 8 year old laser jets installed quickly and automatically<br />+ Gigabit ethernet port, even more important now that Comcast and other providers' speeds have passed 100 mbps<br />+ Integrated wireless works great<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Basic desktop same style of the past 10-15 years... zero design appeal, it's a workhorse, not pretty<br />- Disk read/write can be a bottleneck<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased to recommend this desktop... I will update this review if I run into any issues.  Feel free to leave questions in the comments section and I will do my best to respond within 48 hours.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful.that Comcast and other providers' speeds have passed 100 mbps + Integrated wireless works great  Cons: - Basic desktop same style of the past 10-15 years... zero design appeal, it's a workhorse, not pretty - Disk read/write can be a bottleneck  Overall I'm pleased to recommend this desktop...

4.0,Love having the extra storage this card gives me. The transfer speed to the card is slower than I would like but it plays back HD video without a hiccup.
4.0,"I got this for my son to use for his last year of high-school.  He loves how light and portable it is. It's not a gaming powerhouse, but he does manage to run some less graphically intensive games on it with no problem."
5.0,Works great
1.0,"Ordered it on 1/10/13, never received the first 2 sup[posed shipments then 32 days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit SD card that was detected as fake with H2TESTW software after writing only 71mb's it crashed several times. No hologram or individual serial number on the Chinese knock off packaging either. Make sure you know where they are coming from! Only buy these from reputable authorized dealers! It's worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration!"
3.0,Made with cheep plastic.
1.0,This item didn't work for me I want to return
1.0,"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (p6800) and it worked great for about 3 weeks - September 18 through today, October 7.  It just died while I had the tablet attached to my PC and was copying another file onto it, so I've changed my rating from 5 stars to just 1 star.  I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Another user warned me that this had happened to him after 4 1/2 months, but 3 weeks?!?!?!?!?  I've reported this to Amazon and asked for a refund.Stay as far away from this card as you can, at least for the Galaxy Tab 7.7.UPDATE:  Amazon refunded my money for this card, and I replaced it with the Samsung equivalent, which is STILL working perfectly.  Don't waste your time and money on this card - get the Samsung."
5.0,"Solid construction, and more room than what is readily apparent at first look.  I had overstuffed my previous backpack of the same size.  I had my doubts about whether I could fit everything into the new backpack.  Yet when I transferred everything over to the Victoriatourist, it still looked like it was half empty! Also, the straps and back panel were truly designed for comfort.  Definitely a wise purchase."
5.0,Very simple to format and use.  Excellent storage.  Buy it along with a 3.0 compatible USB  microcard adapter for downloading to 3.0 capable computer.  Makes for very fast and hassle free transfer of your pictures.
1.0,"One of the pieces was defective, prongs inside were bent rendering it useless. The other gave poor video coloration."
5.0,Hard to know what to say exactly about a memory card except that it does what it should at a good price.  Storage case is sturdy enough.
1.0,wireless settings are messed up. customer support sucks. dont buy specially if you are a comcast customer.
3.0,"Good product, and it works well for both of the Lightning-charger devices I own, including my phone when I take it out of the case. Downside is, it doesn't work with either of the cases I've tried for the iPhone 6 Plus (both the Catalyst and Lifeproof Nüüd) so I've had to go back to the shorter-length factory cord. My wife uses it with her iPhone 5S (Lifeproof Frē case) with no problems, however."
5.0,Great picture. Great Customer Service...had a problem with original camera received and they sent me a replacement right away without having to send the one I received back!!!  Great value and works well with my PC
4.0,"Cute little case stand, have used it for a few weeks now and still looks / works like new."
5.0,"Incredibly useful device: it turns an iPad into a laptop, seamlessly.  I have probably got Logitech more sales by simply demonstrating how good it is to acquaintances, than they have by advertising it - because I've NEVER seen an advert!"
5.0,"I chose this for it's size, both physically and virtually. I recently got a new phone that can support 64GB and because I have a lot of music photos and videos, this was a no-brainer, especially since it's rare to find any other 64GB micro SD, SanDisk is the only one I can find, but that's not a bad thing, I trust this brand. It's kind of hard to review a micro SD because if it works, it works, there's not much to it."
4.0,"This is the third 6&#34; Kindle Fire HD we have purchased so we must like them. The reason I don't give them three stars is because they have no memory expansion slot. This would put them right up there with Samsung if they would do this. I use the memory expansion slot very often in my other tablet devices including my Android phones. Great picture and good sound with an unlimited supply of apps and games available from Amozon and the Play Store. Fairly easy to transfer files from another device to the Fire. Also, battery life is good, for the size of the devise, as I get about five hours of video play on average."
5.0,Good but not crazy about the shape
4.0,"I like everything about it except the Windows * OS.  One thing I really dislike about it is it will not allow the use of any apps except MS apps because of the OS, very frustrating because of the limited choices and the fact that I have ones I already use and like and there are not equivalent ones to use.  The MS suite was also a temporary 1-month trial."
2.0,"Broke after two months, the cable is actually fine. But the adapter for Lightning broke in two months.<br />Otherwise it works as advertised."
1.0,"WiFi expectations were very unsatisfactory.  Only one room away, speed dropped by 20%"
3.0,does not stand well
5.0,"I installed this in my phone to take advantage of extra space for downloaded movies and games. Seems fast, cool."
2.0,"I cannot speak to all aspects of this product, but would like to mention one deficiency that is important to me:<br />Windows File Attribute Bits are not implemented. For example, if you set the Archive Bit on a file, it appears successful, with no error messages. Yet when you come back to File Properties, the Attribute Bit has not been reset. This is the property that caught my attention, since I make use of the attribute bit in copying only new files from the EX4 to an external disk drive for offsite storage.<br />I have a Seagate NAS which DOES implement the attribute bit, so I have been able to shift usage to that drive.  I have lost another NAS to lightning, and am considering purchase of a NAS to replace it. I like the EX4 otherwise, but I think it would be foolish to purchase another EX4 until this issue has been resolved. When I get tired of waiting, I will probably purchase a Seagate. ( I do not think that I have the High Performance EX4)"
1.0,"Big as day on my package said DO NOT BEND,  my package was damaged."
5.0,"If you have to have the max storage on your phone... this is it. Not only is it the fastest class available, it is the ONLY decent 128 card available right now. Not a bad price, either."
4.0,"Works great. It is easy to use, even for my tech-averse dad, to whom this was given as a gift. The only hiccup we have had was when a device in the hub prevented the computer from shutting down and/or caused it to wake up. The lights on the hub helped diagnose the problem, so kudos on the product design."
3.0,"Vents in back of laptop will get clogged by dust like lint in a dryer. You have the dismantle the entire laptop, including 50 screws and remove pretty much every component to clean it. It's made to not last."
1.0,randomly died out of nowhere. i have the camera on for about 2 min and the card worked. turned the camera off and back on a few min later and the card no longer worked. I have no idea what happened but this seems to be a common problem with these cards.
1.0,"Total scam,<br /><br />Bought a 2 year plan with my Corsair K70 keyboard but I didn't buy the &#34;correct coverage option&#34; for spills. Spilled pop on the keyboard now I'm out $125 + what I paid for this &#34;protection plan&#34;.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you know exactly what it covers (nothing I guess?), otherwise it's a total waste of money."
1.0,"Turned out to be junk, disappointed in them. 2 of the Chargers stopped working unless I hold it in a certain way."
2.0,The touchscreen went out 4 months after warranty expired. $195.00 to replaced.
3.0,This  product is advertised as a 12.5 ~13.3 inch laptop and it is a tight squeeze for my 11.6 inch laptop???  A bit disappointed
2.0,"Too thick for the fire phone. When I take the phone from my ear while on a call, the screen stays black. I returned it. However, I do use one on my Fire hdx and it works great!"
4.0,Good for the price I paid.
2.0,"However the keyboard was excessively small relative to its size and the space bar worked inconsistently. Had to return it because of the space bar issue. If you don't encounter the space bar problem, you very well might like this laptop."
1.0,"Terrible quality, it is unpolished. Item is not even black, but a shade of grey."
4.0,A bit of a learning curve to get started but I find I really like it particularly if one does a lot of drag and drop. Seems to have eliminated my RPM wrist pain
4.0,"So far it has worked very well, stores more that I need which is a great feature. Another nice feature is the red paint, really, I drop these little cards and the all black version are often hard to find, the red is easy to spot, now if it only glowed in the dark..lol"
5.0,"Great storage for my android phone, practically unlimited space for music.  Easy to install, and it has been reliable so far."
4.0,"I am enjoying this beach scene...it reminds me of home. However, the product would be event better if the light would shine through the stickers so one would be able to see the keys easier."
3.0,Don't use very often.
5.0,I've read a lot of reviews about this not working with the S3. I have had this for 6 months now and no issues yet.
4.0,Good and simple case
4.0,It's a very good case. Very pleasant to hold. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is that it is much darker in reality than it appears on the pictures. I wanted something of a vivid color so that I can find my kindle easily. This is an elegant dark purple color but not as easy to spot as I hoped it to be.
1.0,"Item was broken when received. Poor quality, virtually impossible to get ipad out of case without damaging ipad. Returned for a better quality case. Amazon was very prompt with helping me return this item and receive a refund."
4.0,"I loved it, the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is the back is a little too smooth to hold it securely. I'm sure after a little while it will get rough up, but I wish it was a little more 'grippy'."
1.0,"This car charger for some reason won't work with my iPhone 6. It brings up a msg every time saying that it's not compatible. The only way I can get it to work, is if I use the lightning cord that came with my phone, and through the USB port. This was disappointing"
4.0,"I bought this Ez Go Jr handwriting tablet to replace an old defunct wireless model Penpower Presenter Pen. I find it simple to install and ease to use, just a matter of plug and play.  I have it for 2 weeks and happy with it."
4.0,Nice case but I ordered purple and this is more of a mauve or dusty rose color.  The front lower lip of frame kind of gets in the way of &#34;spin&#34; on my games but I like that it stands on it's own.
3.0,"I was very disappointed with the laptop, it was not what I wanted. I did a search for backlighted keyboards and this laptop was listed. If it lights up, I can't find a &#34;switch&#34;."
5.0,"Super low price for expanding the storage for your BN HD+ Nook. Buy the 16GB version & save money, then spend a few bucks on this microSD card & double your storage. Use the adapter to easily pop into your laptop or PC and easily transfer files when you are on the go. Better yet, buy two."
1.0,It has a has bad quality and it fell apart after a short time. I do not suggest this product at all.
2.0,"Looks great, but the Aukey 12 volt 2.5 amp wall adapter that comes with the 7 port USB 3 hub can't deliver enough power for my USB hard drives to mount (even the ones that have their own power). Ended up going with the all black Amazon 7 Port USB 3 Hub which has a 12 volt 3 amp laptop sized charger and that solved my USB connectivity issues I was having."
5.0,Works great! Perfect length cord
5.0,works great in my galaxy s4
3.0,"Comes off really easy, which I hate. Its okay."
2.0,"I've had this laptop for 8 months now with very light use- maybe once a week for a couple hours.  I find that the main power button does not work all the time.  I have to keep pressing it over and over, but it seems that the connection inside to laptop is bad because the power doesn't turn on, even when plugged in or fully charged.  I don't know if this is a flaw with all the hp streams, or just mine. Also there is little to no storage capacity for pictures, videos, etc.  Double check the specs to make sure this is what you want before you purchase."
1.0,"While this item may have worked the four or five times I used it, it broke less than TWO months after purchasing!  When I went to try and return the iem or get another one, I got the message that it was past the date of return.  Would NOT recommend if you plan on using frequently,"
3.0,"Had this Grantwood Technology charging device for about 8 months. It works alright for the Kindle Fire, but seems to be rather slow to charge. I would advise getting a charger that delivers more power. Sometimes my Kindle flashes &#34;connected to slow charging device&#34; or something to that effect."
4.0,So far so good. Still getting used to chrome operating system.
1.0,Purchased for a family member's traveling business.<br />This unit is falsely advertised out the ass.<br />There is no AUX port or USB ports. The antenna is a built-in and sucks.<br />I'd return it but they already threw it away.<br />What a joke
4.0,This memory is the right price and it worked right from the start.I think this is a good deal and good memory.Works fine in Note 2
5.0,"Not really much to comment on as I have had good experiences with SanDisk Ultra in the past. They are a little more pricey than some of the other brands but only by a couple bucks. What you get is &#34;no surprises&#34;. They pop into your phone, camera, tablet and basically work forever. I don't run speed tests so can't comment on whether they are plus / minus milliseconds faster than another brand (a millisecond here or there really is not a big deal to me). I've never had a failure with a SanDisk product (or Kingston, another good value).I used it for awhile in my Asus Tablet but currently it has been moved over to my Droid. Works as advertised a was an excellent value."
3.0,"The faux-leather material which makes up the outer cover is held on by an adhesive. The adhesive had already begun to fail on one of the inside corners when I took it out of the box. It wasn't a deal breaker, but it got annoying being reminded of the loose corner every time I held the tablet. I ended up selling it to a co-worker who didn't mind the defect. I really liked the aesthetic of it. It is &#34;adult&#34;, if you will, compared to most others. My favorite thing about this cover is that it ages well. I bought it because a friend of mine had one for a few years and over time the edges fray and fade a bit, and it takes the look of something more like an old leather-bound book than an electronic device. Too bad I got a bit of a lemon."
2.0,Chinese crap
2.0,"Looks great and high quality but the truth is &#34;Fit the Surface Pro 3 NOT WELL&#34; While you put Surface inside, push (hardly) to the end and  it still 3~5 mm left out the left-hand side because of thickness if the right-hand side leather. I'm really afraid that if something knock the corner, the case cannot provide enough protection!!"
2.0,Misleading. This states that it is a &#34;graphics card&#34;.  A more accurate description would be a &#34;DVI add-on card&#34;.  There is no GPU this is designed to work with whatever GPU you have and add a DVI port.  If you GPU does not support an additional display this will not function as one.
3.0,I have a problem with the size of these mini cards --they are hard to hold on to  and get in and out of my drift cameras they get stuck all the time
2.0,The tip of the charging thing broke off within a week and I had to throw it away because it was useless.
4.0,Simple to use. Looks good. Finding an edge to start peeling off can be tricky without long nails. Worth taking time to ensure no bubbles. Overall it does exactly what it says.
5.0,Excellent
3.0,well just got it but so far so good
1.0,Didn't fit
3.0,"Windows only, will not work with Mac unless Boot Camped. Works with most games but not all features work."
5.0,Fits snug. Color is beautiful. I love it. My school colors are deep purple gray and white. I opted for the pastel.
1.0,"While I don't like to give anything less than a positive review, I have to be honest and look out for fellow consumers. The controller I ordered simply did not work for me. No matter what I did. And, the disc didn't work either. I don't know how much more I can say. I had to send it back and I'm grateful to Amazon.com for a stress-free refund."
1.0,Keyboard is decent. Feels mechanical the feet on the bottom of mine broke off. and also the keys get dirty easily and are hard to clean.<br />Mouse is total trash. Gets dirty easily. Scroll wheel squeaks. Mouse sometimes when im playing a game like csgo it sometimes glitches and moves around by its self.
5.0,"great product,easy install"
1.0,"failed in my galaxy note after 8 months.lost all my pictures and videos that werent backed up.the card worked fine until suddenly wasnt being recognized on the phone or the computer.Sandisk honored the warrenty and sent a replacement and it works, but I am less confident about the product and afraid to lose data on it in later when i'm not prepared."
4.0,"Not the best, but good and comfortable."
5.0,"I own an Alienware mx 18 r2 and I have been hunting for a backpack that would both fit this behemoth laptop yet not weigh a ton. This is by far the greatest backpack I have ever had the pleasure of owning. It fits everything!  Two external drives, power, headset, as well as a plethora of other items - all with their own spot!  And it is COMFORTABLE!"
5.0,"These SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards work great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet and my Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. I've also used them in non-smart phones, and they work just as well. Fast write/read speeds are HIGHLY recommended to get the best experience from your gadgets and devices, especially when taking pictures/videos, viewing/editing them, opening/editing files, etc. SanDisk has come a long way in terms of quality and performance, and I would not hesitate to buy more of their cards."
1.0,These generic batteries are too often fusion heat bombs ready to set themselves on fire or stop working after in the fortieth hour.<br /><br />Generic 8 cell batteries are larger than Lenovo's since they're lined up as three rows ( 3 rows of two cylindrical Li-ION leaving the flat pad empty of the costlier lithium polymer.<br /><br />Writing a review of the 4 cell seems impossible since this was the only x60Tablet Four cell listed at this moment and you don't receive what you paid for.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!
3.0,"Update ( 1 year 10 days later )<br /><br />Developed an air bubble on touchscreen, and won't stay on if not plugged in. I contacted iRulu which forwarded me to Amazon and got &#34; sorry out of warranty &#34; response. Good tablet for a year. Personally I won't buy from this brand again.<br /><br />Ordered IRulu Walknbook 10.1 Hybrid Laptop (the green one) Windows 8.1 was preloaded and had it upgraded to Windows 10, that took several hours so be prepared. You'll want to add a Micro SD (Sandisk Ultra 32GB not included) because Windows 10 is a big file and won't fit on the tablets internal hard drive. Inserted the Micro SD and it loaded very quickly and was able to use right away. The wireless keyboard is, honestly, a gift because the tablet is worth the $199 and works fine (it is a little on the flimsy and sometimes a glitch here and there but again it's a gift) Apps run smoothly, I installed malware, spyware, and antivirus without any problems but it is slow to scan (more of a overnight thing for very thorough scans ) The Microphone is nice to have but for serious microphone usage a third party one will be needed. I'm ordering a HDMI cord to hook up to my television I'm very hopeful for that and Finally the touchscreen is very responsive no issues whatsoever. I'll be getting a wireless keyboard for the TV use of it. The only Con would be the power input and micro USB are not as one. That would have been nice because micro USB is more common than the 2.5mm round pin connector.<br /><br />Overall very pleased with the product would be very open to a 2nd one for the kids or future models because it is affordable for my use."
5.0,"The drawback is all the darned packaging for this tiny card. Seriously, it's plug in and you're done, why all the packaging?Aside from that, it's working.  I'd buy it again."
4.0,"It is small - not much bigger than my iPhone 6. I wasn't sure if I would like the smaller screen. ( I thought I had ordered the 7&#34; model.) It turns out I love the compact size. It fits into a small purse and traveled well. The case I ordered is working out well. I have had this Kindle for only two weeks. One draw back is that it does not seem to hold a charge as well as my Kindle Fire did, but so far it has not been a problem."
4.0,"I got this card for my phone. I was expecting a significant increase in speed. I have not really noticed any great speed improvements. The card is working great with no problems. Just get a slower card for your phone, you won't notice the difference."
4.0,"They tried their best to fix it remotely, but could not.  I can't find a battery for it online either."
4.0,"the product arrived in a timely fashion, easy to install as I read on youtube that the provider would acknowledge instantly with no phone calls. this happened without incident. I seem to have lapses in internet service and have not determined if it is the box or provider. when the lapses occur my tablet and phone, also connected, work fine. this purchase was to compliment my new dell all in one touchscreen computer so I haven't suspected the computer but wonder if the right purchase may have been a separate modem and router."
4.0,Thanks
1.0,"The matte finish shows every fingerprint, and cannot be wiped clean. The edges are peeling already.<br />The clip-on sections of plastic have been breaking off since I got it. The bottom half of the cover won't stay on now.<br />But, I can say that the keyboard cover looks classy and doesn't slow down my typing. So there's that."
5.0,"Great Design!<br /><br />THE ONHUB DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT FELL OUT OF AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT<br /><br />with 13 antennas you get the greatest best incredible 5GHZ AC spectrum coverage, plus the intelligence of the Google Firmware combined with the quality of TP-LINK, No one can beat this in a hundred years!"
3.0,Had a difficult time getting four monitor to work with when using DP hubs.  I went with a AMD Firepro 7100 which easily supported four 4k monitors
2.0,"While this keyboard is very quiet it does not function properly.  I think the main issue is the wireless component, when typing it double types letters, freezes and all around does not function well.  I think if they made it with a wire then the response time issues would be solved.  Had to stop using this after a few weeks and will be buying something different now.  It is too bad because I really liked the look, feel, and noise level of this keyboard."
1.0,It's a cute case but breaks and cracks easily
5.0,This is a very nice little case. I was surprised at how pretty it is! The pictures don't do it justice. It looks like leather and holds the Paperwhite securely.
1.0,"I bought the 1 TB SSD and the Startech USB 3.0 to SATA cable. I am using Windows 10.  The drive was not recognized. I also tried an Apricorn EZ upgrade case. My 256 GB SSD would still not clone to the Samsung Pro drive. Kept getting a message from Samsung Data Migration software  that the drive was removed.<br /><br />Stay away from this drive if you have Windows 10.<br /><br />There may some issues with the Dell 8500 Sata implementation, but I still think the Samsung drive and Windows 10 do not get along."
2.0,"Many aspects of this laptop aren't too bad. The price is very good for the performance. However, some huge downsides:<br />-Comes with a s***ton of bloatware from Acer. It took me at least an hour to figure out what to throw away and what to keep. What could I delete without gimping the computer? It's not very clear.<br />-However, I found out the bloatware runs even deeper. Need to upgrade your Intel Drivers? Gotta use the Acer drivers! Drivers which many games don't seem to recognize.<br />-RAM upgradability. You can't upgrade your RAM without a technician apparently. This is a problem for me; I live in Japan so I can't exactly go to Walmart.<br />-Hard disk upgradability. The s***ty hard disk read speeds are the biggest problem with this laptop. I thought I could simply switch out the hard drive for a better one, but this is quite annoying as they don't provide the laptop with a backup OEM Windows CD.<br /><br />The hard disk upgradability is a major concern for me especially because, just a few weeks after using this laptop, I get some random periodic slowdowns. Every 10 minutes or so, there's a 1 second program freeze (including games of course); my guess would be that its trying to access the hard drive but cannot go quickly enough, but it might be some of their integrated bloatware too. r<br /><br />It was pretty hard to find information about any of this. Most websites only review performance (which this laptop is not halfway bad at). But Acer are being dicks with bloatware. It's a real shame in light of things like the amazing quality screen, good performance and good price."
1.0,The only thing it could do without crashing is unlocking it. That's the best it could do. Do not buy its the worst tablet ever. Just pay for a nexus7 for 50 bucks more. Do not buy
5.0,"This was purchased to capture video with a GoPro Hero3, and so far it has performed splendidly. HD video takes up a ton of space, but this card will still hold quite a bit of it. Downloading is pretty quick and easy thanks to Class 10 speed."
5.0,Sandisk is the best & moist reliable memory card out there. Perfect fit for my new Galaxy Note 3 smartphone !
1.0,"When it's working, this hub is fine. But it spontaneously turns itself off, and other than a complete reboot, there doesn't seem to be any way to bring it back up.  I would NOT buy this unit again - in fact, I'm buying something else to replace it because of its unreliability."
3.0,The product definitely works: it's a matter of how badly damaged your hard drive is for it to work. I tried several and 1 out of 4 worked. I would still recommend this unit.
2.0,"The card works fine now, but it wouldn't seat properly due to some sort of bracket warping (when the bracket was secured to the case, the card wouldn't seat in the PCI slot).  After having it for a couple of weeks, I noticed my PC was randomly rebooting.  Since I don't sit at my PC often (I just use it to serve media and occasionally remote to it from my iPad), I didn't realize the timing of it coincided with the ownership of the card, so I didn't consider that as a cause initially.  Tonight, however, I noticed that the reboots occurred consistently if something banged the desk or the floor near the PC, leading me to look for loose connections in the PC -- the card was not seated properly still.  I pushed it down to fully seat it in the slot, which required manipulation of the bracket, but now I can bang the desk, the floor and even the PC, and it doesn't reboot itself anymore.  The card seems to be fine now, but the USB 3.0 drive that I had connected to it apparently failed due to the frequent unexpected reboots.  That drive was the only reason I bought this card, but fortunately it was just used for local data backups, so no real data loss....  The drive, on the other hand, is toast.  I can plug other drives into the card and they work fine since the card is in fully seated now.  I'm bummed that this card was not able to remain seated when flush to the rear panel, and had to have the bracket screw removed to allow it to seat correctly, but live and learn...  Update: 9-6-15 -- after having the card in the PC for about a week after the reboots stopped, it started back up again.   This is likely due to my having to open the PC up to take a picture of the card, and causing it to come a bit loose in the slot yet again.  At that point, I removed the card.   Since leaving the original review, Anker support contacted me and was very nice in their willingness to assist.   They offered to replace the card, but I initially declined since the card was seemingly fine after re-seating.   They even refunded me in full for the card, and said I could keep or return it.   They sent me a prepaid shipping label, and I will likely return it so they can inspect it to determine the fault.   Even while removing it from the PC, the card seemed to slip out easily, so clearly there was a defect.   This sort of thing can happen, and the card clearly has great reviews, so I may be one of the few exceptions.   The good news is that my USB drive (and another that disappeared during all of the random reboots) finally started working again, so I lost nothing in the end.   I will consider giving Anker another try down the road, as I am pleased with the company's response to my issue, and willingness to do whatever it takes to rectify it.  I am glad that they were so involved to provide excellent customer service.    Thank you Anker Support.   I wish the product was as good as your support, and hoping I just got a bad card.  I don't expect this is the norm, due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews.   As a result of having to remove the card completely, I have reduced the rating from 3 to 2 stars."
2.0,Would not work and caused my computer to need to repair startup files after removing it to return it.
4.0,Inexpensive and very competent<br />I would buy again
2.0,"WOW, what a major disappointment, pulled up PassMark and this cards performance for the grand I paid vs my several year old GTX580 OC was way pathetic.  Yes in 3D it outperformed most cards, but truth is the 980 performs almost as well in some instances better than this card, in 2D the 980 was equal or better than my 580, the Titan wasn't worth the test wait.<br />Kind of a waste of an evening, install cards, remove cards, reinstall cards, clean inside PC case, install some cool LED lights, fiddle around making them work, hook everything back up after unhooking it several times, yawn.......get return slips......geesh.....<br />Maybe I'm not getting it, or as some have said the 8 gig of System RAM isn't adequate to maximize this cards potential???  But, for a 1000 dollars back it goes, nothing against EVGA, I've owned many of their cards and this is the first instance I've been disappointed, maybe I'll look at the 7 series as it appears it's the value high end card at this time."
3.0,"I bought this for A1466 MacBook Air. Battery works good, but a screwdriver for pentalobe (1.5 mm; size 6) was too big, so I had to get right one (1.2 mm; size 5)."
4.0,Good!
4.0,Nice item
3.0,"I wouldn't recommend. Don't get me wrong, its a great laptop but in college nowadays they're using a lot of software to have access to your tests and quizzes and homework; all of these not supported by Chromebook. You COULD install windows on it but I it defeats the purpose of getting a chromebook in my opinion. Other than that, it's great. It's fast, reliable to the point where its almost impossible to lose documents if your computer crashes. It feels great as far as the keyboard goes, and the weight."
2.0,"The battery worked great for a few weeks, but now it won't hold a charge for more than an hour. Spend the extra money and get the top of the line battery."
4.0,all worked came in on time
1.0,Its not white and gold. its gray and yellow
2.0,"I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I'm mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn't have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that's when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I'd rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one."
1.0,Torn apart in less than a week.
2.0,"its ok, does the job, but, its optics are touchy, one moment it will work the next it doesnt want to move the arrow, it has a cheap powersave mode that turns it off when its in motion meaning this mouse can NOT be used for gaming. it also seems to be an off brand of another mouse designs just like it with a different bug logo instead of a spider. its like the laser/eagle model cars like 7 companies made them all with their own logos lol. if you in an office this would work for you."
3.0,"I've had this for about 4 months now - a few observations:<br />1) It is very fast.<br />2) The build quality is only OK, not excellent.<br />3) It can get very hot - in fact so hot it's almost like something is wrong.<br /><br />The speed is amazing - don't think you can get much faster for this price.<br /><br />Build quality worries me. Very plastic. Also the palm rest area picks up finger prints like nothing else and is made of an almost furry plastic that I fear will decompose more quickly than more firm plastic (just my past experience with other devices, if the plastic is soft, it tends to die quicker).<br />Also because the build quality is poor my screen has two white &#34;pressure&#34; points because while the laptop was in my backpack it must have been squished a little too much and the screen was damaged. Nothing too terrible yet (even Mac Books get them so I hear), but I wish the screen was better protected (I've had it in a neoprene sleeve the whole time).<br />Also the touchpad is made of the same furry plastic and tends to stick rather than have a smooth glassy feel to it. Which can make use a little trying.<br /><br />The heat isn't a big factor, but it does get almost too hot for comfort on my lap.<br /><br />The screen quality is excellent. Great colors, great blacks, great contrast.<br /><br />Given the price - it is a great deal."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B00DS2SZ0Y TRENDnet 1080P KVM Console Extension Kit up to 100 Meters (328 ft.), TK-EX4]]<br /><br />I actually bought 3 of these through CDW since my company directs us to use them when prices are close. The device itself is not really any worse or much better than the Belkin we have used in the past,NTI and a few more.<br /><br />What earned this product 3 stars instead of 5 was my trip down customer service lane. This is a plug and play item, no reason i should have been having such a fight with it but I did. When I got customer service on the line it got much worse.<br /><br />1. If I wanted to call India for tech support, I personally would have skipped the 20 plus minutes of hearing how &#34;Your call is important to us&#34; and dialed direct. This lady had no idea what the hell she was talking about and I am completely certain, 100% sure that she did not have a clue about the product. I had to tell her what the quick start manual said.....unto which i quickly replied &#34;It is your product right? Are you saying that you do not have this information?&#34;<br /><br />2. Screen Reading - Contrary to popular belief, reading a screen an making a mental checkmark of what you have said and in which order is not tech support. I did actually ask her to drop the phone and let someone who knows absolutely anything pick it up. I would normally not get this rude, but after 45 minutes AFTER the 20 minute wait for them to pickup, I was getting kind of frustrated. Having her ask me to start troubleshooting it from the beginning again was the last straw. &#34;Please unplug all the cables and plug them back in.&#34; Me - &#34;Are you sure? This didn't work two other times.&#34; The lady - &#34;Yes please, you need to let me help you.&#34;<br /><br />CLICK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the way with so many of these electronics/tech companies. You look and try to find a good solid product because if you get them on the phone or deal with their tech support in any way, you are hosed.<br /><br />I finally figured out the problem the next day and it was not even with the device. It was with the monitor on the receiver end that was flipping out from the signal coming from the transmitter. New monitor, BAM! It worked. Why it worked half way through the setup and died who knows.<br /><br />The device is in and running. No real issues to speak of. This run is only around 50 feet or so and the picture comes through quite good. No pc hooked to the receiver side, only using a pc on the transmitter and mouse, keyboard and monitor on the receiver.<br /><br />I called tech support to ask 1 question; &#34;I am only calling to make sure I have this thing setup right because I am experiencing weird problems.&#34; Over 1 hour total time and no answers. Total waste."
2.0,"its a very nice case, although it doesn't cover the edges of my laptop, other than that its good."
3.0,"Fabric started stripping within 1 month of playing as it rubs against the table. Quality, its alright I guess. Sad to see that strip of wire gone."
3.0,came in a timily maner.
1.0,I bought this battery 3 months ago and about 2 weeks the battery start don't charging 100% and now if i disconnect from the electric source the computer shuts down.
3.0,"The buttons at touch pad are a kind of loose, and some of the the keys are too small, but it worked with a MacBook 13 mid 2010"
4.0,inexpensive replacement that has worked well so far.
3.0,"BE WARNED!<br />This laptop is fast, I didn't buy it for gaming but for work.<br />When 1 Tb HD failed under warranty, the ugly side of ASUS warranty policy came up.<br />ASUS provides shipping label with ground shipping both ways (from FL to CA!!!).<br />They don't provide packaging. They don't backup failed HD. They also bluntly refuse to return failed HD so I could back it up.<br />They accused me numerous time during phone call for dropping and abusing the laptop and made sure that if there was any sign of abuse in the laptop, the warranty would not apply. I had never before dealt with ASUS warranty, but I read some reviews when people got their computers back with scratched screen etc., I decided to take care of HD failure myself.<br />I'm not the biggest fan of HP laptops, but I've nothing but good to say about their warranty department. Return box was at the house next day for overnight shipment. I didn't ask backup, they offered to do it anyways.<br />This was the deal breaker for me with ASUS. I thought I had found a reliable performance machine but horrible customer service is just too much."
4.0,So far I love these. The sound quality is fantastic and the color features are a cool addition. Cord is quite short though.
4.0,"Do your self a favor and get some memory for that fancy new phone.I have taken countless photos & videos, downloaded several apps andloaded a bunch of music and still have room to spare."
3.0,It worked well other than the height was way off (too short). The description was not clear online about the size.
1.0,did not work for product it was purchased for
5.0,This puts me at about 80 GB on my phone.  I will be purchasing more of these as needed for other devices.
5.0,I purchased this for my Motorola Xoom and it works great. I also use it with my Cannon T2i camera and it is the only card that doesn't lock up or give me a busy while videoing HD. I am very happy with it
1.0,"Crappy plastic holder doesn't fit the tablet at all, the thing is completely worthless."
5.0,I purchased this card to work with my gopro and I have no complaints. I does not lag on 1080p 60fps or when I do a 10 photo burst. Great product and an even better price
3.0,1 out 10 times ill do a transfer ill get an error.
4.0,"This is my first e-reader, and I like it a lot. I was doubtful about giving up actual books, and was afraid it was going to be a cumbersome device to operate, but I was mistaken. These are some of the things that I think make this a very good product:<br />- The portability and light weight of the device. It makes it possible to comfortably read in many places.<br />- The illumination of the device does not strain the eyes, and it makes it possible to read in a darkened room.<br />- The fact that you can have hundreds, and perhaps thousands of books in it.<br />- The fact that you can actually highlight stuff.<br />- Being able to get the meaning of a word (and it can keep track of which ones you look up so you can review later) via an e-dictionary and Wikipedia.<br />- Being able to translate terms.<br />- Being able to get book samples to &#34;test-read&#34; them before actually deciding to buy.<br />- There are probably other features that I haven't explored.<br /><br />The only con I've found is that it does not successfully connect to certain wi-fi networks, especially those in which you would have to click &#34;Accept&#34; somewhere. To be fair, this may be user error rather than the device, but that's yet to be determined."
3.0,"Works well but has no Off and On Switch, The USP plug has to be extracted regularly to switch off and on"
3.0,not enough wind power
2.0,I loaded this memory card into my TF700T and could not get it to install. I found it to be a format issue and could not reformat it to get it to work. I sent it back and got the class 10 sandisc card ( non ultra ) and it loaded perfactly.
1.0,Very poor performance tried two units. Exchanged for the same and both fell way short of favorable. Tried a different model number from the same manufacture and was presently supprised on how well it worked.
5.0,"I purchased two of these microSDXC cards when they were on sale around Black Friday, and have been using them now for just about two months. They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers. All in all these were a great buy and I'm very happy with them."
2.0,Good case.....volume controls are misaligned on ipad2 air. I know why the silver was on sale!!
3.0,Not so easy to connect to tablet
1.0,"Flimsy design, won't hold iPad stable."
1.0,These were terrible. They don't work well at all.
4.0,Quick transfer speeds
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:4653513f9a73d56338bbdf28f1d90a4]] The video illustrates the main issue with the one surviving Green Hard Drive. I don't know why this drive has such good ratings. I bought two of them a while back and used them only as mirror drives (only ever plug them in to put files on them and then put them away). In my estimation these drives were built to occupy a landfill somewhere. One of them completely died pretty soon after purchase and the other is so slow that I grow significantly older each time I use it. I was promised that the drives run between 5400 & 7200 RPMs but I'd say during a simple file transfer they run at about 500 RPMs. The one that's still active takes forever to appear on the desk top and it even takes a while to empty the trash. I have always felt like this drive was trying to hit rock bottom, which I admire in a human, but not a machine. The only reason it get's two stars is because it actually functions. Since you cannot give a rating of \\""no stars\\"", you have to save 1 star for things that don't work at all (in my humble and correct opinion)."
3.0,it's so big display..OMG
1.0,Awful!! They took the hard drive out of the computer so it was like buying a brand new one all over. Would not recommend them to anyone. Very disappointed
4.0,"Works as described, though it should include a DC 5V power cable (which is not essential to this device's function), or include more detailed specs<br />on what type of plug to buy and recommend a model its compatible with."
1.0,Cheap quality/plastic - and it didn't work!
1.0,Does not charge at the proper wattage.  Do not buy.
1.0,item i ordered was 64gb it listed it on the card but this was tested and at most was 1gb and very oldi would steer far away from sandisk sold online unless it is in original packagingI returned it for a full refund and reordered and oem 64gb card from samsung
4.0,I am not sure I don't know if it is the tablet or lollipop.  Sometimes I can't get a good connection.  Otherwise I do like it.  It does almost everything I want.  els well made.  I have one of there computers and I thought this was a good buy and was thinking that there computer was good.
3.0,Doesn't last long.
1.0,"This is adorable, no doubt. I loved the keyboard, for the whole month that it worked. When I first received the set, I definitely would have given it four stars (deduction for the ridiculously loud keys and the slightly awkward mouse). So, if you're using this for set decoration, I say buy it. But if you need them to work, I'd do something else with your $30."
4.0,I put this into an old Samsung table that my kids use and it seems to work well. We have some videos on this card as well as a large number of apps. I have not had any problems.
4.0,seems to be working just fine...bought as a gift for a family member and they're using it for video recording.
3.0,It works. But you will find it is bulky if you are a traveler. I wish the made a thin model.
1.0,"ok as a tablet, really bad as a phone ( full signal on other Androids - 1 bar on this one with the same SIM), battery below average, customer support is a joke really"
5.0,"This went into my Raspberry Pi, and it works great. I have had nothing but success from this little guy. Also, it conveniently came with the SD adapter."
2.0,"No range, had to return it and go back to time warner modem and my original router"
5.0,Works perfectly on my GoPro camera Silver Edition HD 3+. Been in use for about three months with no problems. Highly recommend.
4.0,Drivers do not work for windows 7!  I tried downloading the drivers on windows 7 and my computer froze every time I tried to check for hardware changes.  I then upgraded to windows 10 and now it works great!
5.0,"Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support.I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)"
2.0,was hoping that you could use the USB port on the tablet while charging no go defeats the purpose of wireless charging.  Sent it back.
5.0,"I have a lot of memory cards for a variety of digiral devices. This is the smallest memory device I have ever owned and 32 GB of storage, that's outrageous..."
3.0,"It's kind of slow, but not s bad mouse for its price:)"
2.0,"FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives.<br /><br />The photos show an apparent HP v250w USB Flash Drive, but it is a fake. Genuine HP v250w drives (altually manufactured by PNY) are made to a maximum capacity of 128GB. See &#34;http://www.pny.com.tw/index.php?mode=product_detail&PID=78&#34; for HP v250w product specifications and check for yourself. Any v250w advertised with a higher capacity is one of many Chinese-made counterfeits that have flooded the market.<br /><br />On top of that, counterfeit drives invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low. Read on...<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back. Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive. To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals. Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine formore information.more information."
5.0,"Comes with a lifetime warranty.  Had one fail once, sent it back to SanDisk, they sent me a new one!I have been using SanDisk for years.  That was the only time one ever failed!!!"
5.0,Great brush!!! It really helps when trying to brush kids hair!
5.0,"works perfectly well with my Galaxy s4! before use, i put the micro sd card into the adapter and put it into my laptop, connected my phone to my laptop, transfered all my stuff from one sd card to the other, and it worked well, i still have all my stuff... with PLENTY of room to spare... and now with the S4 you can save your apps onto ur sd card, so whatever i can save on my sd card instead of the actual phone memory, i save... now both have a lot of free memory =] very happy with this purchase. have had it for a while now."
4.0,"Palmrest area is wearing out after a month of use... Also was a bit difficult to apply since it's very sticky. Blue color wasn't as vibrant in real life compared to the ad, it's more of a blue/gray<br />Other than that very nice product"
1.0,I'm am not tech savvy but I would not recommend this product to anyone who has to save videos bc it will not let me format it to FAT23? 32? Either way a waste for what I needed it to do
4.0,all ok
1.0,Can't connect to internet. Technical support not helpful.
4.0,"The first one i received died in less than 2 months. It just stopped reading (lost all that was on the card), but Sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it. Not so enthused about the speed. Transfers between phone and PC (USB 2.0) weren't impressive in my opinion, slow, but the bottleneck could be the phone, but still..."
4.0,"Nice looking, fits well and economical"
5.0,Great
4.0,"very easy to configure, straight forward options. I am a network administrator so what I find easy, others might not. The two things this unit desperately needs:<br />1) larger holes for antenna access. I had to modify the corners to get better antennas on the unit. The bigger antennas improved performance by about 20%. View image, not pretty but effective. Im sure it voided the warranty but who cares for $35<br />2) mounting options. (there are none). This thing is so small and light the power and network chords move it around with ease.<br /><br />Other thoughts, flash the firmware as soon as you get the unit."
4.0,Nice little mouse for the price. I bought a bunch of these for the office and most people like them compared to the wired mounse that PC's come with.
3.0,"I did not recieve a remote and aux cord that was supposed to come with the speakers.  It also looks like i received a used pair of speakers.  They still work, but i would have rated this 5 stars if i got the brand new one instead of used speakers."
2.0,"Poor Reliability. Tablet worked well for the 2 weeks I had it, then it just stopped coming on one day. Only the red led charging light comes on, but nothing on the screen or sound, its totally dead. Luckily Amazon gave me a refund. The tablet worked well until it didn't. I had hoped for better reliability but I guess these cheap tablets just aren't reliable. Your experience may vary.<br />5 stars for Amazon refund policy however."
1.0,This cord died in less than three months.  I will be ordering a new cord from another company.
2.0,"I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one's worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable."
1.0,"Very disappointed the range of the router is very poor no more than 6mts, bought this to substitute the carrier default modem but the one of the carrier has more range."
4.0,"Just finished pulling 4000 ft of this cable through new construction and didn't have any issues.  I would recommend that as you get closer to the end of the spool you will want to unroll the length of cable you need and stretch it out.  This will help keep the cable from kinking.  This is common sense with any coax product no matter what vendor.  I would purchase this again as the cable quality and insulation were adequate.  I have not terminated this cabling yet, so I cannot comment on the ease to install compression ends at this time."
2.0,"Overall I expected more from this product, I thought I could use it to be more productive but so far all I'm able to do is play games because in my opinion this product isn't very work friendly."
4.0,"This generation has pros and cons from the generation of the E-ink Kindle that I had.  I hang onto my technology as long as possible, if it is working for me.  The pros are 1) it is smaller in overall size and therefore lighter; 2) the &#34;light&#34; is internal and you no longer have an extra purchase for a light in a case and 3) the screen is a touch screen and there is no keyboard.  Some of the pros turn into cons for me.  1) The internal &#34;light&#34; acts more like a contrast mechanism and seems to cause more eye strain for me than the E-ink with the external light source; 2) The touch screen is annoying at times. When I want to wipe away a hair or piece of dirt that fell onto my screen, I accidentally turn the page; 3) a power adapter has to be purchased separately if you want to charge from an outlet.  This came with the purchase of the E-ink Kindle and luckily it works with this generation as well. 4) You have to now pay extra to get the Whispernet (free 3G) which I did not have to do with my original Kindle.  I travel and find this a nice feature since this is more readily available to me than wi-fi and therefore easier for me to download or order another book."
2.0,"When I have used these to sync or transfer data they have worked fine.  However, I use them with a tablet that draws nearly 1A and these cables seem to carry only .5A.  Without one of these cables attached, my Samsung tablet charges.  Once attached, my tablet discharges, although a bit slower."
5.0,"Well i do try to take alot of pictures and with this card it does the job for me, i would recommend this to even my enemies really good product especially when they go on sale on amazon....Package kinda two big for this little thing, but i will work with that little problem."
1.0,This cord sucks! We have gone through 2 of them now.  They pull apart very easily when you unplug it from game console. Highly recommend spending more on the actual xbox brand cable.
4.0,Great sound quality and durability. I wish it had MAC OS X support to adjust settings
4.0,Very good price for a good quality product
3.0,Doesn't always help in the dead spot which is why I purchased it.
4.0,I bought this specifically for gaming on my PC. Works as expected.
5.0,"I have been using it for several months in a helmet cam, several times a week. No problems so far."
3.0,I have to replace every six weeks as they end up getting bent on the end
2.0,They're comfortable and my voice comes across nice and clear however the sound recently stopped coming out of one side. Prior to this problem they sounded great but unfortunately I can't use them anymore.
5.0,wouldn't know it wasn't brand new if it didn't say it was refurbished in the description. works perfect.  the only thing I could pick at is that the charging cord is not apple brand and the little plug part was junk.  but that's not a big deal to me at all.
5.0,"Bought it for my S4; it Works like a charm.  No setup needed, my S4 reads it automatically.  Great price. :)"

5.0,Works as it should.
1.0,So far it has not worked. Keeps giving error even after reinstalling.
5.0,Got one for my wife's S3 and it works perfect.  The frustration free packaging is nice so I can just open the package and get right to the product.  Didn't have to do anything special...just put it in the S3 and worked immediately with no issues.
3.0,"i would love to buy this keyboard, but unfortunately i just feel that it is way overpriced. Hard to tell how good the material quality is in the keyboard from the pictures but it looks nice. For the price, I'd hope that the quality matches. I just don't know that I would ever spend more than $100 on a keyboard."
2.0,"I followed the steps very carefully and did my absolute best to ensure the Surface 3 was clean and dust free.  However, upon application, I noticed two small imperfections in the screen protector.  There were two spots where I could not remove what seemed to be dust.  Also, after application, the outside of the screen had some sort of residue that was difficult to clean off.  Once I was able to clean it off, the screen easily attracted fingerprints and smudge marks.  When using the Surface 3 without any screen protector, it wasn't as easily dirtied.  I feel like I'm compensating the original aesthetics of the Surface 3 for protection.  I was hoping that this wasn't the case from previous reviews.  I'm really contemplating just removing it and calling it a loss."
5.0,"Functional , safe secure gives, holding devise , & options"
3.0,"Only gave it a three because honestly I have not had time to use it. I will next week and rate again, however I love my Kindle 7. If it's anything like that one it's great."
4.0,"The physical trackball using the thumb is my favorite way to mouse all day, everyday, without any wrist pain. I have used different Logitech trackball models over the last 10+ years, and was sad that the USB corded version of the model is more expensive than the wireless model.  The Logitech wireless unifying drivers to pair the USB receiver with the mouse/keyboard has been Windows primarily, so I wasn't sure devices owned by me, would be used for the same long life time, like the corded versions I've owned and used.  If you don't have access to a Windows machine to set these devices, it is just easier to steer clear of them.  It appears that Logitech is making progress on porting the setup software to other platforms, but it does not appear to be without risks.  So be aware.<br /><br />At first, the trackball feels a touch sluggish until it is used a few days, and then it either break-in, or your body calibrates itself to the touch and that sensation is gone. I have been using two of these, one at home, and one at work for a solid year, and I am very pleased with this version of the trackball.  I have owned at least 4 others over the years, but this is my favorite of the lot so far.  I'm on the same set of batteries!<br /><br />My wrist thank me everyday that I enjoy using computers with these devices.  I'm considering purchasing a couple as spares, because I'm not sure that they won't be phased out over some other input method in the future, that I won't lime as well.  I usually try and repair/replace switches in these instead of buying new ones, so I get better than average long life.<br /><br />I like the Logitech brand, and get reasonable satisfaction from using their products as long as my expectations are in check."
1.0,Was wrong battery
2.0,"The chemical odor was so strong that it filled my living room as I tried to air it out. If it weren't for that, it was still much too big for my Dell XPS 13&#34;. Returned."
4.0,It's more compactly designed & gives a great look to the tab.
1.0,"Too big. it doesn't fit as in the posted images. In reality, it looks different than the posted images. When I tried to return it, they didn't accept my claim to return back. I would give it &#34;ZERO STAR&#34; if I could. Don't pay it and look for someone can fit the WD My Passport Ultra 1TB Portable External USB 3.0 Hard Drive."
5.0,"I am using this 64 GB card onSamsung Galaxy Note II N7100 Unlocked GSM International Version White. I coped over 50 GB podcasts/music. It took several hours to copy from a 3 year old laptop. After copying, the inbuild Samsung's music player recognized all and playing is very smooth. The card looks super fast, no reading. After booting the phone, the music is indexed almost immediately and I can play. I have attached a screenshot which shows only 59+ GB is available. The 5 GB seems lot to be missing. I am assuming it is used for storing some index information/some restore information."
2.0,It was so so so hard to put this on my MacBook screen without air.
1.0,It had problems 2 weeks in. There is a crackle noise in the left ear. I've stopped using it since.
3.0,"The cables themselves were essentially worthless for my particular application. My Samsung Galaxy S5 and a Lenovo tablet barely charged at all, even when plugged in separately to either of two different Anker chargers with these cables. The charging was so weak the phone actually used more power than was added when the screen was in use while charging. Also, the connector on one of them became loose from its housing and did not maintain a steady connection without being placed in a certain position. However, the same chargers work fine with the equivalent Cable Matters cables in white, as well as with iPhones and iPads on Cable Matters lightning cables in both black and white. That leads me to believe it is just these cables that have the issues.<br /><br />Those things being said, the company sent replacement cables with no hassle. When those did not work any better, they ultimately issued a refund. I would give the cables themselves a 1 star rating and the customer service a 4 or 5, so a 3 seems generous given I still need to find cables that actually work."
3.0,It works but the pic isn't great. But...you can watch movies on you phone and project them on your t.v. that's cool.
5.0,"I could let this thing bang around in a pocket full of keys and coins (accidentally of course) and still come out working great. SanDisk makes great SD, SDHC, and MicroSDHC products and this is one of them. Affordable and easy to use storage, this also CAME with the SD Card Adapter.I've used this to move pictures and files onto my Chromebook with ease."
2.0,"I take care of my computer, so I have no idea how this happened. But there are little pieces of plastic that connect the bottom plastic to the side plastic on the edge (the edges on the sides at the bottom of the computer aren't fully covered, they have little hold the cover together). One of those broke and it was like a tiny needle that scratched my lap pretty bad."
1.0,Does not work!!!
2.0,"This is actually a very nice laptop with a major flaw: the trackpad.  It's practically unusable.  Trying to right-click in any manner is very difficult.  Two-finger tap to right click?  Nope, only works about 1/3 of the time.  Trying to right click at the bottom right of the trackpad?  Simple, right?  No...the bottom of the trackpad's click area is actually only one button, not two (as you'd want for left-click and right-click).  as a result your finger needs to be on the mousepad in the bottom-right zone while clicking in order for it to register a right-click instead of a left click.  Still simple, right?  No...the most comfortable place to click without actually looking at the trackpad is on the edge of the trackpad, but when you do this not enough of your finger is on the trackpad to register that you want to make a right click.  Also, most multi-finger gestures (such as scrolling) take 2-3 tries to get it to register, and require you to press down very hard to get them to work.  I know this is a long commentary about the trackpad but it's seriously incredibly difficult to use.  I feel like I'm fighting the trackpad whenever I'm using it.  It seriously wrecks what is otherwise (mostly) a great computer.  Also, I'm constantly hitting the trackpad while typing and it moves the cursor - there's options in the settings that are supposed to address this but none of them actually do the job.<br /><br />Pro's: keyboard is great, screen (i have the non-touch ips semi-gloss screen) is great.  I have the larger extended battery and it does last a long time, even on full brightness.  It's light.<br /><br />Con's: If it weren't for the trackpad this would be a 4 or a 5 star product.  Other cons: 12gb memory limit (you can do 20 gb if you're willing to buy a super expensive ($350) non-registered 16gb so-dimm from IM Memory), the bottom gets very warm (not hot) with moderate use and never seems to be fully cool."
4.0,This is fabulous. I got this for a project and I was so glad that I didn't spend money on a more expensive brand.
5.0,I just received my product today. Just in time for school too! It arrived a lot earlier than expected. The product is soo pretty!!! It's not real leather but it feels like it. My computer fits perfectly. Im impressed. I bought the turquoise one. Its really bright but thats what makes it so pretty!!
3.0,"There is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die.  This is known defect (affecting a lot of Galaxy S3 and Note users), so if your card dies, either exchange through Amazon or contact SanDisk for a replacement.  Newer cards are supposedly fixed, but you might want to back up your data just in case.  Mine were purchased in November 2012 and both have now failed in separate phones, unreadable by PCs or phones."
3.0,"Like the color of cover, but too large for IPad.  Wasn't a snug fit and the cover kept covering up the camera when taking pictures."
5.0,This works with my Galaxy Note 2. The phone recognizes it and it reads 59.47gb available. Very sturdy card fits perfectly comes with the adapter. Once you place it in your device it is best to format the card so the device can read it. You also want the class 10 rating.
4.0,ear muffs a little small for my ears.
3.0,"Still don't feel is very fast or is just my phone, I guess I will need to remove it and run some R/W tests. Still Its ok."
2.0,"I purchased this product thinking it looked easy enough  to use and the price was right.  When I received it I followed the instructions, however, I wasn't able to insert one connector into another that was supposed to slide together.  I tried repeatedly to get them to slide together; no luck.  I didn't want to damage the connectors so I opted to call the companies tech line.  After all they did insert a small piece of paper into the instructions that pacifically said their customer service techs were standing by and will be &#34;happy&#34; to help.  I called and when connected I could hear the person breathing on the other end but no verbal response.  I finally said hello is anybody there?  The person finally started to talk but never announced who he was or what company he was working for.  Anyway, I was trying to ask if this was a product I had was defective or was this the way the connectors worked on all the devices.  Well he started to talking over me to silence me and was rude and verbally abusive.  I was talking to him in a normal voice and was shocked and taken back by such an unprofessional response to my inquiry.  It continued from his end as I wasn't allowed to get a word in edgewise. It continued getting worse and going down hill from there.  I finally had enough of the verbal abuse for one phone call and hung up.  This product is of poor build quality and it would appear the companies customer service is no better than their product.  I would encourage to buy another brand unless you're into verbal abuse and poor quality products."
1.0,Bad!!! Bad!!!! Bad!!!!
5.0,Works great--thanks!
5.0,Got this for my Sansa ClipZip. It holds all the songs I have on my computer from the cd's I have downloaded. Great to have for extra data when needed.
3.0,It's decent
5.0,"Lotsa space, man. Observed writing speed is between 10MB to 7MB on my dedicated USB2 card reader. I wrote mostly music on it for my Android phone. Speed only matters for faster writing."
1.0,"Extreamly hard to install,"
5.0,"I don't want to write a review for each of the 8, 16, 32, and 64 GB SanDisk MicroSDHC Class 10 Cards. They're all 5 stars. They're extremely fast, and as Class 10s, have allowed my Canon SX50's shutter to speed up because it transfers information so quickly with the camera's very small processor. They also allow a burst mode of 9-13 fps which is amazing for a non-DSLR.These cards are also very reliable. I've had no read/write failures in the two years that I've been using them.The one &#34;negative&#34; is that they're so small and can be dropped easily when getting them out of the adapter. Still, if you've been working with computers since there was a gerbil running the power for your PC, you have to marvel at how anything this small can hold more than 30,000 high def 6 GB photos on a 64 GB card that is smaller than your pinky nail."
1.0,"Do not buy this headset, i learned the hard way that this model is known to be deffective. There is a ear bleeding buzzing noise that cannot be fixed."
2.0,The mouse portion is hard to use and jumps a bit.
2.0,quit working after about a year
3.0,I am not truly satisfied.  I cannot slide to. English.  All the languages are speaking.  I cannot delete them.  I think instructions Should have been included along with the iPad.
2.0,Flimsy. I returned it.
4.0,"At the risk of stating the obvious for many, new SSDs have to be formatted. It's not just a matter of switching out the hard drive and restoring via Time Machine. I found out the hard way and then followed these instructions... http://www.cnet.com/how-to/upgrade-your-macbook-install-ssd-hard-drive/. The new drive is working great. The CNET recommended software is free (trial version) and was very easy to follow. The copying process took about three hours. Outcomes... painfully slow startup time has been reduced to a few seconds. My excessively large Gmail inbox loads very quickly now. These are just a couple of examples to illustrate greatly improved overall performance.<br /><br />Buy the SATA cable, NOT INCLUDED WITH THE SSD (should be), thus four stars versus five."
1.0,Battery doesn't hold charge. Total piece of shat
1.0,Data cables worked as advertised. The power supply was a different story. I tried using it on two separate 3.5&#34; Seagate drives. Neither would spin up. The power supply nameplate ratings are 12 volts at 2 amps and 5 volts at 2 amps. A quick search yielded the drive specs. The drives need 2.8 amps peak at 12 volts to spin up.  I scrounged an old AT power supply to solve the problem. DO NOT buy this if the supplied PS is your only source of power to the drive.
3.0,"The case itself:<br />Luvvitt brand cases tend to get discolored over time. I'm not sure due to what but I have a friend that has a case for her phone that's Luvvitt brand and it has turned a brownish/yellowish dark color that does not look very clear at all over time. That's something I was willing to live with however because I know from experience that the protection itself is great and sturdy. Also I don't think I will be taking my iPad around places &#34;naked&#34; with a complete front-covering case.<br /><br />With an all-around protection case on it + Luvvitt case:<br />I really just needed protection for my iPad since I already have a case with a built-in bluetooth keyboard (Belkin). This case + iPad Air still fit in my keyboard case, but I feel like over time the case is going to get worn out from me removing my iPad from time to time. It does work for now though.<br /><br />With a screen protector on + Luvvitt case:<br />You pretty much have to forego having a screen protector if you are getting this case. You can also cut the top off your screen protector, but who wants to create more bubbles and have a tacky cut on the screen protector? Because the case wraps around the edges a little too snugly, the case tends to push your screen protector out or lift it up which made me SO ANNOYED. I mean who doesn't have a screen protector on their touch-screen electronics these days? That's like leaving the house without shoes on."
3.0,"I do not know what this is, or even if or why I would have bought it????  It appears to be a battery for a laptop...  I HAVE bought two of these in the past and they are still working as well as should be expected. (so I bumped it up a coupla nothches)"
1.0,"I installed the drivers that came with this and it corrupted my Windows 10 install. Windows just wouldn't boot up anymore! I mean, yes ok you don't support Windows 10, but there were no warnings and you just make the user's computer unbootable!?  Good thing I'm somewhat of an advanced computer user so I was able to fix my windows by disabling the corrupt drivers using autoruns.exe.  Then I found out that you can get Windows 10 drivers for it at Fresco Logic's website. (Google 'Fresco Logic Thin2000 USB drivers' if you need it.) And so I got it working on Windows 10. However I was disappointed to see that at 1920x1080 resolution, the display kept flickering very hard. At lower resolutions it is at least usable though and could handle things like playing a video fine. However 1920x1080 resolution is what I bought it for.  I recommend that if you have the drivers that came with this installed, DO NOT upgrade to Windows 10 before updating the Fresco Logic Thin2000 drivers."
3.0,"The cable works like it should, however the USB plastic casing isn't that great."
1.0,"I have zero complaints, this card does exactly what it should. I'm amazed by how inexpensive memory cards continue to get. These things are really useful to throw on your keychain because they're so small.Update: From 5 stars to 1. Dead after 4 months. Appears to be a fairly common issue: [...] Let's see how the RMA process goes...."
5.0,Installed into my PS4.  Easy installation to perform.  There's certainly a noticeable load difference.  I mainly bought it so I don't have to buy hard copies of the games any more.  Plenty of room for storage.  Works great so far!
2.0,It is adorable however it does not stay closed on its own which makes it inconvenient compared to some if the others in the same price range.
2.0,Pieces started chipping off within a month. I don't have a habit of dropping things or handling things roughly; this case had a cushy lifestyle and still cracked!
2.0,"My Kindle works great for the first eight months, then my battery quit charging completely. The only time I can use it is if it's plugged into a wall. As soon as I unplugged from the wall, it loses its charge. I'm very disappointed."
4.0,"I've only had this replacement battery for a couple weeks. The ability to hold a long charge is off/on but lately more on than off. Time will tell but I'm happy to have this replacment battery. Especially when the power goes out, for traveling, and for studying for long hours while out and about."
5.0,"This is the first class 10 memory card I have had and boy is it fast, I actually bought two, one for my digital camera and one for my Galaxy 2 7.0.  Saves images really fast in my camera and does not slow down my tablet at all, great product at a great price."
5.0,"Bought it a couple of months ago. Works great. Initially bought it for entertainment, but now I am using it for school to replace my heavy laptop. (beware, not intended to replace the laptop as it carries a mobile processor.) Other than that, I've had no problems w my tablet."
2.0,"Ended up not working with my MeMOPad, which I believe it said it was supported. Ended up throwing it away but I did like the design for what it's worth."
5.0,"Seems to do what I needed at this point. (just got them). Went on easily, and no bubble problems. Cuts way down on glare, as I gig outside a lot. Tried it out yesterday in the blazing sun. Nothing is 100% gonna cut out all sun glare, but these DO work far better than nothing! I could see my lyrics, so there you go! Can't go wrong for the price. Had to manually trim them for my 10.1&#34;  RCA Viking Pro 32 gig tablet (another great product for the money) on one side, but they do the trick! Happy guy!"
2.0,"It's okay. It gets hot but not too hot to touch. It also has a higher profile than the non-USB3 drive. I would rather have a lower profile than USB3 speed. So, meh, 2 stars."
4.0,"My work computer is a 15&#34; laptop, and if you center it underneath the pad, everything is cooled, no overheating even during heavy processing. On my 17&#34; laptop (I know, it's a bit old), the cooling pad can't get to the back left side. By perspective, I'm talking about when one is working on it, the back left side regarding the computer exhaust and fans. Therefore, I normally move the laptop a bit more towards me and to the right, so that the cooling pad can get to the back left area. It's a bit off center while working, but then the cooling works. Therefore, I'd say it can't truly get to the full surface area underneath a 17&#34; laptop, but I like that it worked off the bat. Oh, if you're into overclocking at all, this certainly doesn't hurt, but it won't get you all of the way there."
2.0,"This worked fine for DV&#34;I pass through, but the VGA didn't work... Disappointing that they don't mention it isn't a converter...."
2.0,Disappointed with this purchase because I didn't realise it didn't have a motion sensor thing to allow you to play certain games. So I still have to buy an additional adapter for it.
1.0,"These work okay...I think it really depends on the layout of your house. We tried using them for work, but it didn't seem to help our weak signal."
2.0,"I bought this laptop and it was amazing for the first week. However, after a week, I started having issues with the built-in microphone. I updated my drivers using the Drivers Update software that Aorus provides, and the laptop completely lost sound. Even after reformatting, it wouldn't work. Amazon provided me with a replacement, and this new laptop came with a faulty trackpad. Whenever I left/right click on this trackpad, I have to push it down real hard for it to register the click. This was not the case on the first laptop they sent.<br /><br />Amazon is willing to replace the laptop again, but I'm a bit skeptical about the quality of Aorus now and am considering getting a refund and moving onto a different brand. I've lost so much time waiting for the new laptop, installing all my programs again, and shipping the laptop for return."
2.0,These lack the button terminal common to other 14430 size batteries.
4.0,Good for my old MBP15&#34; but not with the Case.
5.0,"No problems yet, works fine in htc sensation, it seems kinda slow but I'm thinking it's a problem with my phone interface not the card itself"
3.0,"This was a case i had high expectations for. I was looking for a keyboard case that had the rotation ability and could also have the ipad be removed.<br />When i recieved this case, I found that the foam padding on the inside of the case pushed my ipad air out so that the bezels were exposed. The corners also had slight cracks in them. After only two weeks, all the corners now have cracks and have small pieces falling off. (I am not taking the ipad in and out of the case at all). The corner where the power switch/camera exists is the worst, with the whole corner breaking off in less than three days.<br />The rest of the case is perfect. The stand and the keyboard are holding up fine, but the rubber attachment doesn't seem to do a good job of holding the case together when not in use.<br />In its current form, I would not reccomend this case to anyone.<br />If they improve the ipad holding part of the case, I might consider giving it another try."
3.0,"I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording.. For cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement.."
5.0,"I purchased this memory card for use in a Galaxy S2 smart phone.  Music stored on the card plays without problems.  Works great and while not the cheapest, the price was not bad.********Update 11-28-12*********After about 1 month of use, the card failed.  After a few emails to SanDisk, they issued and RMA and promptly provided a warranty replacement.  On the whole great service.  These things are tiny and some failures are expected, so as long as this one keeps working, I still give it 5 stars."
4.0,I like it so far -- time will tell how long the bearings and brushes will last. I have it on top of one  computer case that has a spare USB from the motherboard.
4.0,"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!"
4.0,love this keyboard and case combino...it is great.  the ONLY thing that I dont like about it is that the keys on the keyboard were starting to wear onto my tablets screen.  that was easy fixed by turning the keyboard upside down when storing the tablet and keyboard together.  Love the way the keyboard is big enough to almost be full size.  Great buy.
1.0,They don't charge as fast as the Apple product and you have to plug them in one way (not both sides). You get what you pay for...
3.0,They should be more explanatory and function with alcanse of operation. for the countries where it can function
4.0,Nice little tablet.  Works fine and holds a good charge.
4.0,"The last card I got was bad, but at least this one is working properly.  SanDisk is the best brand."
3.0,Was not exact replcement. Add clearly states the model number it is and it is larger and diff style.
5.0,Got here on time and works as expected.
2.0,"I didn't expect much sucking power from a cheap, USB-powered vac, so I was surprised that this failed to meet even those low expectations. Neither of the attachments stays connected to the vac while in use—the brush attachment in particular falls off at the slightest touch, which defeats the entire purpose of having a brush.<br /><br />It is incredibly loud for such a small device, and doesn't seem to suck up more than the most minute dust particles. The lack of vacuuming power combined with attachments that don't stay one make it virtually useless as anything more than a noisemaker."
3.0,Mostly beneficial however there are some bubbles for sure
2.0,Disappointed. This started flaking and peeling almost immediately.  Will not repurchase or recommend.
5.0,"Installed one of these in my Galaxy S4, nice addition. All my HD movies and audio files stream from this card, Perfect!"
4.0,Perfect compatibility.
4.0,Bought this to use in my 8 inch Onda tablet.  No problems or issues installing or using.  Have about three months.  Would recommend to others.
2.0,Mine broke after 2 weeks.
3.0,"It works great, looks nice just like the picture, and hasn't had any technical issues so far, but the braided cover is already wearing out after only a couple of months. It's normal with other iPhone cables (even Apple brand) that I've ever owned to wear thin around the connectors from repeated stress from bending,  pulling, etc., but never so fast! By getting a braided cable I was expecting more durability than the original plastic/rubber one. I bought a Tech Armor brand braided cable in the same length at the same time and have used them both equally, and the Tech Armor one is not showing any wear at all."
5.0,"Can't go wrong with s SanDisk product. Love it. Bought it to expand the memory on my Samsung Galaxy S3 - At&T. So far, no issues, no lag while playing videos."
3.0,"If you are going to offer a product that serves only one release of one operating system, you might want to make that a bit more prominent...like, oh, I dunno. Maybe within the first two sentences of the product subscription? It's 2015. We have rovers and orbiters on/around other planets, and even RealPlayer doesn't suck any more. There's no excuse for such a limited product when it's not pointed out immediately."
4.0,No windows 10 drivers!!!! Major drama getting the drivers to work on windows 10 - if you aren't tech savvy it might be difficult and will require troubleshooting regardless. In the end I ran the drivers for windows XP in XP compatibility mode and that kind of worked.<br /><br />Otherwise these are really nice with great sound quality.
1.0,DONT BUY THIS IT DOESNT EVEN WORK
1.0,"after one year of having this tablet, I lost access to the D drive that in the keyboard unit. Now, I lost a lot of stored files and I am limited to the space in the tablet."
5.0,"Fast data speeds, large capacity and worked right off the bat in my Samsung SIII. Love the fact it holds my large music and audio books library on the device."
1.0,Ever since I received this product it has not worked properly.  At least 2-3 times a day we need to restart/reset the router to connect online.  It's a huge pain.
5.0,"Great value,  protection is great !"
2.0,"The first thing when you switch it on is &#34;ASUS: In search of incredible&#34;. Then you then get this: Awful non-vibrant colors, very short battery life, charging takes a whole day, crashes frequently, changes volume without user input, and the plug for the charger is already so clumsy that I am sure it will break soon. As developer, I have bought this device for testing my app on it. If I would have bought it for real use, I would have been very disappointed. In other words, compared to my 3 year old iPad 2 it is crap."
3.0,"It's easy to set up and use since it's basically a plug and play wireless mouse. Looks cool, especially with the lights on. Not sure if the DPI Button works with my computer since I've upgraded to Windows 10 and the drivers may be off: I haven't noticed a difference when I press the button.  The auto-sleep mode to save battery is a little too short for my liking; I spend a short amount of time writing and then the standby mode turns on, meaning when I grab the mouse again I need to click to wake it up. A little annoying while writing essays.   EDIT: The wheel squeaks a little too which is kind of disappointing considering how quiet the mouse usually is."
2.0,slow transfer rate... but cheap
5.0,I have gotten up to 15(expecting 30 is unrealistic I suppose) and consistently gotten 11 to 13 MB/s with this which is fast enough so that it only takes a few minutes to transfer 20GB at a time. Good little SD card for a good price. I have and will continue to reccomend this microSD. Using in my EVO LTE phone.
3.0,"If you have a Logitech M510 mouse, then don't get this mouse pad because it won't work with it.  I had bought this in black and the M510 wasn't able to track on it.  I ended up returning it.<br /><br />Additionally the hard surface creates a &#34;scratchy&#34; sound.  Take your mouse and move it across a solid surface and that'll give you a close idea of what you'll be dealing with.<br /><br />If you're mouse is compatible with this and you don't mind the sound, then this may be the last mouse pad you'll ever buy because this thing seemed almost immune to normal wear and tear of a fabric mouse pad.  And it was rock stable.  No shifting around at all on my desk."
1.0,Worked for two months and no longer functions...
1.0,It doesn't cover the entire keyboard. And it doesn't stay in place.
2.0,"On paper this device is amazing, IRL, this is a disappointment. When in the menu the Burton commands from the included are recognized only 10% of the time, even after eliminating any interfering light sources, and changing the distance from the box. The device also constantly changes source even when only input source is connected to it, which stops the recording and when in game play is more then annoying. I wanted to like this box, but due to the issues mentioned, I can't recommend Antoine but it. Update: I just updated the firmware to 1.1.9 and the menu was more responsive but eventually provided the same frustrations. Anyone looking to purchase an external capture device I would recommend something like the El Gato devices which based on reviews seen to have less of these problems."
1.0,"This thing is junk.  Connects to the network at a random Mbps, and pings to google.com give me high ping times and packet loss.  Tried it on two computers with the same results.  Don't bother with this one and just get something from a better brand."
2.0,"Samsung at the time of writing this review has not released software in order to install SSD on to Win 10 PC.<br />Samsung Data Migration, and Samsung Magician Software that come with their SSD are not Win 10 compatible."
4.0,"Overall, just a great value in a Windows tablet!!"
2.0,Super loud! :/
5.0,Great Product
2.0,The audio on this set works great but the mic quality is beyond sub par.
2.0,"It works. It's a cord, people. It will work or it won't. If you are expecting some great, new video quality out of this or any other cord, quit right now and read some REAL reviews. I only gave two stars so somebody might look and see what I wrote and learn something. The gold-plated cords are no better than any other. IT'S  A BUNCH OF WIRES THAT CONNECT TO POINT ON ONE END AND CONNECT TO OTHERS ON THE OTHER END. End story."
1.0,"Pros:1. ordered it and got free shipping.2. got it in 3 days.3. popped it out of the box.4. popped it in the cellphone!5. Done!Cons:1. doesn't come with a hot pocket.2. Amazon won't marry me.3. took me too long to order the hell was I thinking.4. took too long to get it out of the box 1 second!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------update:Okay  I have to bring this rating down to 1 star.... My 64gb SD card just crapped out. I'm getting the ""0x80071ac3"" code and i cant format it or copy files to it. I ran scan disk and nothing works... I don't know if i will be buying any more SD cards again from them. luckily i was able to save all my files. I've goggled this problem and this is a common problem with these cards..."
3.0,Looked stronger online...probably my own fault for not reading the details.
5.0,"Whatever others say about Amazon going their own road in the Android market, the FireOS 4.5 is a well done operating system.  Somethings were lost from the old HD, such as the video player remembering where you stopped in a video.  But so much more was gained like a better photo and video player, a better camera app, integration with Amazon Drive, better control over your Amazon account, and so on.  Also, the Amazon app store, while it will never reach the heights that the Google Play Store has made, continues to be a stronger and stronger choice for finding the apps you know and love.  I do hope they can work out whatever issue it was that ticked off Mozilla so I can stop sideloading Firefox.  I mean, Silk is nice, but it's no Firefox."
5.0,Great product. I replaced my previous case and this one is sturdy and looks professional.
5.0,"I needed a large capacity, dependable high speed card for my action cam on a fishing trip and this card delivered in spades! Recording and playback were flawless."
1.0,Device died within 3 weeks of ownership. Screen quality is almost as bad as a lower brand tablet. Tried all methods other users had posted and still nothing. This is a wide spread issue with this tablet in particular.
4.0,"pretty good, kind of upset that I can't store apps on the sdcard. Very nice sized. Slow response. I ended up giving it to my 7 year old because his kindle stopped charging. He enjoys it because it plays the games he likes."
3.0,Uncomfortable but actually practical. Shield is in the way usually so i took it off
4.0,Good product with reasonable price.
3.0,"I bought this yoke to use it in my Flight Simulator Software in my Mac (X-plane). The quality is quite good although it came with a very wide &#34;null zone&#34; which means there is a very large neutral area where the X and Y axis do not move at all (pitch and roll in an airplane). This is not normal in any other joystick/Yoke since most of them replicate a real airplane yoke which in real life have a little or almost no &#34;null zone&#34;. After adjusting any possible option in X-plane software I called tech support who offered me good help but no other solution that to send it back in order to be repaired under warranty.<br />Reading other past reviews I realized that this issue is an old one (over 3 years old issue) and I can´t understand why Saitek has not addressed it yet!<br />If we leave aside the &#34;large null zone&#34; issue in X and Y axis, the unit has an excellent quality and good functionality. The three lever control is smooth and works awesome.<br />Saitek/Mad Catz: I think it is time for you to review your program code in the internal electronics! This is not a potentiometer or mechanical issue but a firmware  issue. Please check other threads about this issue which has been solved by other users using bypassing the original USB controller and using an alternate controller with excellent results (Leo Bodnar´s BU836A 12 Bit Joystick Controller."
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
2.0,The cable/software didn't transfer all files.
5.0,"Really good inexpensive router, but my use was for basic speed cable, not 10+ mbps, so I cant speak to its performance beyond that"
3.0,Ok
2.0,"I can not say it is a bad MicroSD Card, but mine Stopped working after a few months of normal use.Every time I put it into my PC or Smartphone a message came up saying that I needed to format it, But when I click on format, it showed another message saying that it was unable to format it..... The one I purchased to replace it is a POLAROID which by the way is working better than I expected.While it lasted it was perfect."
2.0,"Not great quality ... It *worked* OK in our 2006 MacBook, but it's not a perfect fit (see other reviews) and as soon as I installed it and started using it, it &#34;bulged&#34;.  Oh well, I just needed a working battery in it so I could sell it, but the bulging battery was definitely a turn-off; I probably would have returned it if we were keeping the laptop."
4.0,"Honestly, when I unboxed and first turned on this little device, the experience wasn't that pleasant as I expected. It comes completely uncharged and takes up to 6 hours to be fully charged. Also, Windows 8.1 is kind of a clunky operative system and doesn't behave that good as is expected to be in a tablet/netbook pc.<br />But, here is why I give a 4 stars rating to this little device:<br />1. For the price, this device performs a very good performance,  of course I don't use it for hard work, but for casual gaming and internet surfing it is ideal. I mostly use it for reading in the Kindle app (Kindle app for Windows still has a lot or room for improvement, but it is another story) and for watching videos in YouTube.<br />2. Battery life is very long. Ok, it takes 5 hours for a full charge, but it lasts 1.5 days for me. (I always use it with the battery saver configuration which works very good for me). So I let it charging during the night and forget about this 5hours charging time thing.<br />3. It is a really usable portable device. Let's face it: I also own and Ipad, but the Ipad doesn't give me any productivity, before buying the Asus, I always preferred to use my laptop instead of a tablet, because although Windows is awful, it has the things I need. Now, I am always trying to use my Transformer instead of my laptop, because it's little form factor + productivity make me feel so comfortable.<br />4. The physical Keyboard and touch pad. I am really happy I bought a windows tablet with a physical keyboard, the experience would have been totally different without it. Typing is quicker and also the keyboard works as a nice stand for your tablet when you are watching videos. So, here is my advice for everyone buying a windows tablet: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL KEYBOARD, I can bet the experience would be hideous.<br />5. Another advice: DON'T BUY WINDOWS TABLETS WITH LESS THAN 2GB OF RAM. Simple, windows doesn't work well with less than 2gb.<br />Now, Why did I not give 5 stars:<br />1. Drivers issues, specially when upgrading to windows 10. Upgrading to Windows 10 was far from pleasant in this device. I had several BLUE SCREENS OF DEATH, yes and all the drama that comes with it in the middle of a Windows installation. I thought I completely ruined my tablet during the process. I have technical background so I knew how to fix it, but I wonder how a non technical user would react to this fatal errors.<br />2. I hate windows, I use it just because it is practical. But being honest it works awful and the apps available are very crappy. Facebook app is so poor, it looks just a 2010 facebook app version for ipad. Kindle:same thing, and Netflix, crashes for no reason always. Windows 10 is definitely a good improvement, but it is still klunky and awkward to use. So, another advise: DON'T BUY A WINDOWS TABLET  IF YOU WANT TO HAVE COOL APPS OR A COOL TABLET EXPERIENCE. Windows tablets are small computers, no tablets, they give a different experience to windows, and certainly make it nice to use with touch, but windows tablet are not as smooth and flawless as ipads or android tablets. Don't buy this tablet to your little kids or elders, because this is more a serious tablet, not a fun al the way easy to use tablet."
4.0,"It fit, and it appears to workI have not yet had ANY issues with this cardhowever, I have only been using it for a few weeks...so my comment is based on my experience thus farIf my position changes, I will delete this postso, if you are reading this, then no problems has occurred thus far"
2.0,The fan is louder than my previous one. Not going to use it
2.0,"Worked fine for six month then stopped working. Could have been physical damage from rough use, but didn't see any visible signs of it."
4.0,Seems fast.  Wish it had an activity light.
1.0,I never got the leopard it was a brown case
3.0,I am very pleased with the added keyboard.  The case cover is not as strong at holding the unit as I thought it would be.  It does cover and protect is as I thought it should.
1.0,"This product is nothing but a waste of money. #1 They don't actually fit the tablet they say they do (ONE TOUCH PIXI 7). #2 The adhesive is a complete joke. When I put it on, the corner is still sticking up and easily comes off. One thing that's is true is there is no residue when you take it off which i'm very thankful for."
1.0,"Purchased in Oct 2014.  Worked fine for 6 months and then wouldn't hold charge for very long.  Macbook also give &#34;service battery&#34; warning.  Price felt too good to be true, and it was! Lesson learned!  Spend the money for the real deal."
1.0,Failed after less than a month.
1.0,"I bought 2 on July 20 2015, started using the first on July 30.<br /><br />On August 21 it died.  Suddenly I started to have problems to save documents.  To my surprise the SD was not recognized.<br /><br />I went to windows, but no volumen was recognized.  With recuva recovered some of my family pictures, but all was trashed.<br /><br />Then I tried to format.  A quick format worked, but again, trying to restore a backup the card when to unreachable on windows.<br /><br />So I did a complete format, but it always failed at around 20%.<br /><br />I tried on 2 different machines same result.<br /><br />After that the card become totally unreadable.<br /><br />I didn't expected a Samsung Memory Card to die too quick.  Now I started to use the second, let's see if my luck changes with this new one.<br /><br />:-("
3.0,"No HDMI port, if I would have noticed, would hade other choice"
2.0,"The absence of a forward facing camera made it unacceptable.  Otherwise, it probably would have satisfied my needs."
4.0,"Fits perfectly and the stand functions just as well as the Apple ones.  One thing to know is that while the Apple ones magnetically stick to the side of the iPad to attach the two, for this one to work, it places a cover that fits over the back of the iPad.  In other words, for the Apple one, the back is exposed, if you like to see and feel the iPad as is.  For this one, the back is covered, which may make it feel a slight bit more bulkier to some and may be less desirable if you want to feel the uncovered iPad back when you hold it."
5.0,I purchased and use with my Surface.  It stores quickly and is easy to use.  I really like that SanDisk makes it compatible with regular SDXC and Micro.  Good product.
5.0,"Well since 16 GB is not enought for me I purchased this one specifically for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (Which by the way is far better than the iphone 5)... I have both so I can compare and I am not trolling... In any caseThe SanDisk 64gb works perfectly with the Note 2. I transferred the original info from my previous 16 gb sdcard to this in a heart beat. Now I have movies, music everything. Works Great.Dont understand how people can rate it with a 1... Product works as described 5/5"
5.0,"Popped in my Galaxy S5. Works.Disk came with an enclosure to be used when inserting into PCs, laptops, and other devices.Shipping was fast."
3.0,Keyboard is impossible to program. Does not save my key color combinations. I don't think the drivers are updated and good luck finding where to update them. Weird clicking sound from the space bar. I very much dislike the size of the 'Enter' button. To small and I continuously hit the '\' button.
3.0,You'll get about 9 months out of this cable before it becomes useless. I used it in my car every day before it suddenly stopped working. Now it constantly connects and disconnects your device every few seconds until you get tired of hearing that Apple charging noise and ultimately give up...
4.0,"First battery that was shipped would not hold a charge. After contacting the seller, they shipped another one out next day and this one seems to be good."
1.0,I was looking forward to this as I wanted to play a could casual games on my nexus player. It came in a timely fashion. Packaged well. The controller is very nice. But.... Will not connect to my Nexus Player. I tried several time. Had a friend that is very techy try it. But no matter what. It will not connect. Like to give it 5 stars. But with the fact that I can not even use it. One. Maybe I just got a bad remote. :/
1.0,It took a network engineer to figure out why my WiFi network was so slow.  He said this extender was delaying and dropping packets even though the radio signal was steady.  Replaced it with a Netgear extender and now everything is working great.
5.0,"The card I received works perfectly in my Samsung Note 2. It comes with a converter to normal SD size, and I used it to copy music and photos from my iMac to the card. It picked up straight away in my mobile device and works fast enough for taking pictures and videos with the mobile.Delivery was fast as usual from Amazon, and packaging was good.On a sidenote, I own a couple of DSLR cameras and generally prefer the SanDisk brand for my memory cards. I've seen other brands fail at the most inappropriate of times, but never had a failure on a SanDisk."
5.0,"Fantastic case. Good coverage, snug fit but still slim. It totally fits my purpose. What a bargain"
5.0,"Functions perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy Tab II.  No issues with slow processing times.  Great product, I highly recommend this memory card for tablets."
1.0,"No good keyboard....needs work...keys don't register...onscreen...and too many hours trying to figure out how to connect with PC, waste of money..."
5.0,its a sandisk ultra card. all i can say is that it records data for my go pro without problems.
5.0,You do need to have  the right equipment to use as very few can access these.  Only newer and equipment that CLEARLY STATE can use these will work so be aware.
4.0,nice
5.0,"This went into my new Samsung Galaxy Light cell phone to store my music files and my cell phone photos. Zero problems. These SD cards just work (until the don't). SanDisk is a top brand and I have no trouble recommending this. Look through the many dozens of other recommendations, too. Class 10 UHS-1 is one of the fastest protocols available currently."
1.0,I haven't had this item that long and I am not able to use it.  The card corrupted and told me that it was locked and I couldn't remove anything off of it or reformat the card.  I lost everything that was on it.  Pictures music etc.
4.0,"This is my second case. The design is well thought out. Not only does it look good, but it is comfortable and does not hide any of the key functionalities."
1.0,"Absolute junk. Flimsy plastic housing, and the usb ports stopped working after 35 days. HDE refused my request for a return/refund, past 30 days you're on your own."
5.0,"Operate extremely well, and a great price to boot!!"
3.0,It didnt last as long as expected.
5.0,I minor hiccup or two but we got the issues resolved quickly and efficiently. The tech support was great. I love my new computer.
3.0,I assume it was good but it did not resolve the problem. they did deliver the product as stated online Thanks eric
1.0,"I purchased this mouse May 12 and received it May 14, since then the mouse has been slowly malfunctioning.  The problem is the optical sensor would periodically give out and not track the movement of the mouse.  The other buttons work fine but you would suddenly lose mouse movement and this is a huge problem for a gaming mouse!  The only way the mouse can recover from this malfunction would be to unplug the usb wire from the computer and plug it back in.  I've tried this on multiple computers but the problem persists.  Hey, what can you expect from a $11 mouse..."
4.0,"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!"
1.0,"I needed a new battery for my Acer Aspire One because the battery life had diminished to only about 3 hours since I have used it for a few years now. The LB1 High-Performance Battery seemed like a good replacement. The battery that came with my laptop is 2500mAh compared the new one that has 4400mAh and the size is about twice as large. I switched out the batteries and I was surprised to find that once it was fully charged it only had 4 hours of battery life! I tried recalibrating the battery several times and it is still the same. If you are expecting to get a 'High Performance' battery for your little laptop, don't waste your money on this product."
4.0,This cover was perfect for the AARP RealPad.  I liked having the ability to order what color I wanted.
1.0,"I didn't buy this thru amazon, but through Sprint, which charged quite a bit more for it. In 4 months, we have been through TWO of these, both for the reason many others noted: the hinge fails easily and miserably. I am so disgusted I looked this item up on amazon to leave a negative review, which I've never done before."
3.0,"I bought this for my new samsung galaxy s 4, and the first one I ordered produced formatting issues on my phone every time I rebooted. I looked online and found a number of these got recalled (or something) at one point, and some didn't but just don't work.I returned it for a replacement and the replacement has worked fine in my phone with constant use. I'm on month 4 with no issues."
3.0,"Have only transfered some pictures and music so far. My S3  Galazy had no problems recognizing the card...hear a lot of rumors about memory cards not working, having to format first, etc., but this one worked from me right out of the box.The included Adapter is also good when I want to use with my computer(s) for slide shows since MicroSDHC are not supported by many if any..just to small."
5.0,"Great looking, very sturdy, snugly fit, and doing its job as advertised."
3.0,Only a few weeks in and it shows signs of wear in the area of use. Used a G502 on it. Now using a MX518 because the g502 was garbage.
4.0,"The monitor's great, but it keeps freezing up the system.  I'm still working with ViewSonic's tech support on this."
3.0,"There are some things I really like about this case, however it was cracking in several places pretty soon after I started using it which was a little annoying.  The case itself isn't bulky and closes up well.  It looks nice (Or at least it did before I taped it up like crazy) but even with very gentle use- no drops- it's going to need to be replaced pretty soon after I received it."
2.0,"not bad, but not loud enough unless it is right in front you."
2.0,The case itself had a brown stain on it when first opened (that won't go away) and when putting it on noticed a crack as if it had happened from someone putting it on their fire multiple times. But other than that no complaints.
3.0,"Ordered this case and I like it. However, I am missing the strap. Otherwise, I would have given this a 5-star"
3.0,"I works well enough for a USB Hub. Can be used to charge mobile devices since it has supplemental power supply. However, since every cable plugs into the front, it makes it difficult to manage it as part of my desktop setup. I wish they considered having the power cable and the main USB connection enter the rear of the device - so as to give more space for the hub ports."
3.0,Works well but the size and mechanism are a little clumsy.
5.0,"Seems to be fast. I use it in a Galaxy note for media storage, and it seems to move files as well as any USB stick."
1.0,"I ordered this cable July 7th.  August 27th, it stopped working to charge my phone.  I am not pleased.  Just over a month of functionality is not adequate.  I am very disappointed."
2.0,"I bought TWO pieces but one of them is not working for using it less than 2 months. It can't be formatted or recognized by different PC.  I think it should be a warranty period of 1 year, so I can entile either a replacement or a refund. Please take necessary actions."
4.0,This i love
3.0,"They are not as confortable as I wished. After a while my ears hurt; I use glasses, so it's only worst. The sound and mic are awesome, but I can't use then for too ling without feeling disconfort. The older version was better, I wished they would still sell then."
1.0,too bad this adapter did not work - we had to send it back and even had to pay the shipping for it :(
3.0,"after 6 months of normal usage, it starts to crack and broke. Cheap plastic I guess. You get what you pay"
5.0,"I purchased two of these for my wife's and my phone. We've had no issues whatsoever with formatting and placing files onto this card. You really can't go wrong with this purchase, except if the price is a bit too much."
3.0,"When it worked, it worked extremely well. Smoking fast extender. However, it would continuously drop the connection from my router requiring a rescan to reestablish the connnection. Not even a reboot would work. Eventually I was no longer able to access the extender wirelessly to rescan and was forced to connect via ethernet. A real pain for its location. But even this stopped working, or was intermittent. Had to reset to factory default in order to connect to it again. I followed the suggestion on Amped's support forum and assigned a static IP address and changed the Channel to 20MHz. This worked........temporarily. But it soon dropped the connection again and I was back to square one. Not to mention changing my router settings created additional problems with my wifi! I highly recommend this extender if you can get it to work. As for me, I replaced it with a Securifi Almond 2015 and have had no problems since. My only regret is the Almond cannot connect or transmit at 5G. But it's still impressively fast, was extremely easy to setup and I have no regrets. I may be looking at an Almond 2015+ when I'm in the market for a new router."
5.0,"hello,we have been using sandisk memory cards since the beginning of sd cards.  this latest version was recommended for my samsung galaxy 4s phone.  with the zillion photos, videos and apps, the original 16/13gb of space was becoming full and not saving due to ""lack of space.""  so, the sandisk micro sd card was the answer.  pop the back off easily on the phone, slip the mini sd card into the provided slot, make sure it ""clicks"" in and put the phone cover back on the unit.  it is as simple as that.  now, i have 32 gb of extra space and my new phone stores anything i want to store.  (i constantly make backups to my home computer...very easy)  the connection simply shows the phone data and the sd card data when connected to the home computer.  i transferred my largest photo/video file to the sd card.  now the original 12gb is open for more instant quality photos and videos.  when the original card gets loaded again.  13meg camera takes super quality photos and videos, but also takes up a lot of space.adding a micro sd card is less expensive than ordering a 32gb galaxy4s, but yrmv  great productupdate...  the original ""super large"" file that is on the sd card still shows up on the original gallery screen.  it still has the same functions, but my original 16gb shows more room for the next zillion photos, etc."
3.0,"Functional; however, when attempting to use in the latitude or portrait position, stability of the Tab S is not as good as expected."
5.0,"received it, cloned it, inserted it, booted it. SCREAMING fast!"
4.0,it extends the 1s and 0s just fine
2.0,"I knew it was cheap but I thought I would give it a try.  The keyboard works fine, but its not bluetooth, it plugs in and that connector sticking out of a tablet is begging to get damaged.  Still, I would have used it but it just could not securely hold the 7&#34; Polaroid tablet.  It constantly slipped out and fell right from the case.<br /><br />Beyond that, the case has a nice color feel.  Wish it would have worked for the tablet.  I bought a different one from Best Buy (much more expensive) which works perfect and has a rechargeable bluetooth keyboard.  Holds the tablet perfectly."
1.0,"I was very disappointed in this product. I worked the first few times I used it, then it kept skipping as it read the discs. After maybe 20 uses, it won't even read discs at all now."
5.0,I use this in my dash cam and it has worked perfectly for months in the hot sun and freezing cold.
2.0,"It works ok, on a short term basis, but every day, at least once a day it gets patchy reception and then interrupts the signal blocking everything.  I found it better to simply suffer through poor wifi reception."
3.0,"I love the print on this case, however it is not what I expected. It's not sturdy and it seems it would break quickly. I also noticed that there is no magnet to help the cover stay closed."
2.0,"This case was very easy to install, but only lasted about 2 weeks.  Now it no longer stays clipped onto the iPad because the corners are not constructed well.  I've tried many things to try to adjust or fix, but I have to invest in a different case.  The iPad is used every day and I was hoping that the case would last a little longer than this.  Although it was pricey, my Apple smart cover lasted 2.5 years."
5.0,got it on time in a simple but secure packaging. inserted it and worked without issues. comes in a clear plastic case with an SD adapter. the is the typical SD case size.the sale price of $16 and change was great as well.love it!
5.0,"Not much to say, It is a memory card and does the job well. No problems at all with this card"
5.0,"Lot's of space now! My Galaxy was getting full, so I got this. Tons of space for movies and music and pictures and videos and kindle. Get the point? Lots of space."
5.0,"I'm always happy with a SanDisk purchase. I am currently using this microSDXC in my cellphone Samsung G4, which is more than enough for pictures, videos, and document downloads. Very fast read and write."
1.0,"I can say that SanDisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and Digital Cameras, but I am very dissapointed of this Memory Card.The card memory is only 25GB and the speed is 14MB/s which is not as advertised.I gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and I started to use the Sony 32GB MicroSD. I can say that it works perfectly: the storage is 32GB and the speed is 43MB/s.Buy it now: http://amzn.to/1iGqMVm . This is the exact link I used to buy mine."
3.0,returned
2.0,"Its small, it fits my 11 inch laptop perfectly across, and its 6 or 7 inches long,So many people bought this, and it was a better price than the larger ones"
3.0,"I bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop. Worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it (could read just fine). I couldn't even format it. So it kinda just sat there for a while. After trying to format it a number of different ways, I finally contacted sandisk, and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge. I would have maybe given this a lower rating, but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card. I am just glad it fell under a warranty period (I think). Had the card not failed, I would have given five stars. If sandisk wouldn't replace it, would have given one star. Hopefully the latter doesn't happen to you"
3.0,"I was very excited about purchasing this for my son's tablet. When I received it, the case was in it's packaging but when I opened it it had dirty spots on the back and the front..... It makes me wonder if it had been used and returned.. Not cool! Other than that so far we have not had issues but my son has not dropped the tablet yet either."
2.0,"I wanted to love it, 2700 reviews can't be wrong, right? Well, I put the brand new Ipad in the case and tried to test it standing up on the kitchen counter. The Ipad went &#34;flop&#34; in a second. I ordered two cases(have 2 Ipads at home) so tried testing the other one and &#34;flop&#34; again. The stand with the handle is just not wide enough for support the weight of the Ipad. Plus the recline is not good enough, would be very hard to watch anything on the Ipad that practically stands up 90 degrees. Maybe it is good for those who never need to use the stand. Well, in that case I would recommend thicker rubber cases and no stand, but offer a lot more protection."
4.0,good price they work fine
5.0,good product
2.0,"I'll keep it since it's not worth the extra effort returning. Other pictures show that the case is clear but there's a frosted finish that I wasn't anticipating instead of the glossy finish that a lot of the other pictures show... It's cheap enough for me to use it since I bought it to protect my laptop from school and it seems pretty sturdy enough to last me a while. Mine came with a keyboard protector so that was a pleasant surprise but I would rather the case be a completely clear and glossy finish instead of just throwing in the keyboard protector. If it does break, I won't be repurchasing this particular case."
2.0,Purchased this roughly eight months ago. It has been a great purchase but recently the hinge has started to break. I possibly open the laptop two to three times a day on average as I go about my day and generally haven't had an issue until now. The is a plastic bezel at the bottom of the display that is completely disconnected along with the hinge clearly not functioning properly. Will be requesting some sort of repair to resolve this.
2.0,It works but not very well. You kind of have to hold your mouth right. Takes a bit to get it to actually connect to my watch and I have to secure it with a rubber band. Definitely recommend finding another source.
4.0,Great antenna for the price. Held up to it's specs exactly. Nice mount for indoors and good length of coax already attached.
5.0,It is a good buy; it works great with my sports camera. It was well priced and I recommend it to all users of sport cameras.
2.0,"Eh. It died completely after 3 months - cheaply made - boo. It may be cute, but not functional."
3.0,"Even with help from the manufacturer, I could not get this to work on neither of my computers. It's not ready for Windows 10 yet, but will be sometime soon. However, it would not work on my Windows 7 laptop either. The customer service from the manufacturer was prompt and detailed, but nothing would work to get this item to operate, so I returned it."
5.0,"This is a SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10, that means that it is a fast card.  You cannot beat the price, unless you buy a slower card.  Great quality, great name, & outstanding price.  Cannot go wrong with this card.  Costco sells two of them in a pack for approx. $25.00.  No shipping charges thru Amazon.  Arrived very quickly. I am very happy with this card."
4.0,I bought this to explore some of the KALI2 hacking tools. I would not leverage this as your core home wireless router / WAP.
3.0,"If you are looking for a sleeve simply to protect and hold the surface pro and the keyboard then this is the product for you!  However, if you are seeking a carrying case to also transport your many cords that are required to project or to give additional USB ports then you can forget this case - it is too small and tight!  I do love the color and the feel of the materiel but it does not meet my needs when I am running to a meeting and need to bring the Surface and it's many many parts."
1.0,"I have lately purchased two micro-SD card one Sandisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC and 1 Sandisk Extreme Pro microSDHC 16GB. The first one claim 30MB/s the second claims 90-95MB/s. I 5 tests on my Galaxy Note 2 and 3 different benchmark test on my computer using USB 3.0 card reader. I can only get 7-8MB/s (this not even class 10, let alone UHS-1). I even did real world testing by copy a large set of data (2GB of photo).The result is no different. I do own Sandisk extreme SDHC card on my T3i and I do get 65MB/s of transfer rate. I strongly recommend consumers to test their premium (UHS-1) microSD. I felt very disappointed on Sandisk. I will try other brand like Samsung, Patriot or Lexar."
1.0,Pretty cheezy product.  Not that impressed with it.  Used it for about 3 days until it broke.
2.0,"Product held up great for the first two months, at first it would charge my phone at 1100-1800Mah now it only charges at a rate of 433Mah"
4.0,"UPDATE:I raised my star rating on this from 1 to 4 because of the customer service.  I was able to get a replacement pretty easily.  Hopefully it will last longer!ORIGINAL REVIEW:This item worked well while it lasted.  I bought it in October 2012 for my tablet pc and then for an android smartphone.  I did not make many transfers to the card, it was mostly reading files from it.  Now it is March 2013 and suddenly the card is no longer recognized in my android phone.  It is no longer recognized on my other devices as well.  I lost many photos and videos on the card because of it.  I'm sure Sandisk will exchange it for a new one, but this shouldn't be happening with a card that is less than a year old."
1.0,These are the slowest thumb drives I have ever used!  Terrible!
1.0,did not work
1.0,all 3 corrupted when i tried to use them what piles of junk
5.0,Purchased based on the recommendation from a reviewer of a dash Camera also purchased here. No issues at all just works.
2.0,"Purchased for Samsung Tab4.<br />Installed and worked perfectly.<br /><br />After just about 2 months stopped working on Tablet, shows as blank, can not read.  Tried to format, won't work.<br /><br />Tried connecting to PC and formating card on PC, error card can not be formatted."
1.0,Either it is the wrong chip or a false reading by the device because the data displayed consistently is &#34;insert ..&#34;
3.0,"This is better than the plastic version of screen protector, but inferior to the Anker glass screen protector.  I could not get it to lay flat at the edges, there is a little overhang so there is a little hollow edge around the entire perimeter, and a corner that has an air pocket of my ipad3.  I purchased the Anker screen protector for my husbands ipad air, it was 1/2 the price of this one and is perfect ... plus the company did a backflip for us when my husband broke it while he was installing it, and sent a new one out free of charge!  If Anker made one for ipad3 I would have returned the intelliglass one without a doubt, since it just doesn't really fit."
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected. I must not have studied it enough before purchase. I did not realize that you have to separate the case to put it in landscape view, then do it again to put it back together to close. I must have confused this one with the ones you simply turn. Corners are covered well with this case and you can access all your buttons and tabs easily. It's stitched well and seems sturdy. I really like the color.  So for these reasons...&#34;it's okay....&#34;"
3.0,"I'm using this in a SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 16GB unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that you'll be so p.o at a crucial moment , say for example you want  to access a video  or doc , that when you do actually get your file you've lost  all faith in the card .So buy it for the capacity but always remember it's not reliable  for fast access."
1.0,didn't work.  three people read the directions and coulnd't get it to worok
4.0,"Works as advertised, but don't get this type of device if you're hoping to capture signatures."
1.0,First the charger port is not working I try many different charger it didn't work the antenner is poor hard to get a signal so I'm disappointed.
4.0,"This is an honest review of a bag I'm quite happy with so far. The quality, look, and feel overall have exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The quality of the leather is firm and strong - perfect for carrying heavy items and maintaining its structure.<br />The smell is genuine leather - love it.<br />The design - very attractive and unisex, yet secure. Nobody's getting into this thing without having to work and catch your attention lol.<br />The size - I can fit EVERYTHING into this bag. As a career woman, this huge. Nothing worse than toting 3-4 bags to work everyday on the bus or train during rush hour!<br /><br />Now for what I don't like:<br />I wasn't crazy about the dry film I had to wipe off with a moist rag once received. However, given the price and country of origin, I am understanding of the manufacturing process and didn't find this to be too much of a bother.<br />The leather was not preconditioned - if you want it to have a bit of sheen, you'll want to have the mink oil, etc., handy. I'm not fond of my leather looking dry.<br />The buckles and strap connections make me slightly nervous. However, the stitching, bolts, and reinforcements in the high stress areas do give me some comfort. Still, I probably wouldn't use this bag to carry anything ridiculously heavy on a daily basis. I will be carrying a lightweight laptop, iPad, and toiletry bag, and it seems to accommodate like a true champ.<br /><br />Overall, I adore this bag! It's exactly what I was looking for and looks as though I paid 5x the amount for it, especially after the conditioning. As a matter of fact, a bag I saw for around $450 wasn't nearly as cute. I plan to give this one a real go and will report back in a few months after a bit of wear and tear."
2.0,"The mouse itself is excellently designed, save for one major flaw.  In order to use the mouse via wireless, you must use the provided 6' USB cable attached to the base station.  This is means there is no benefit to using this with a laptop when travelling.  I contacted Razer Support and they confirmed there is no option to sync directly to my Razer Blade laptop.<br />The software is great, the mouse feels nice, but it is not portable, not even with their own hardware."
2.0,"I just bought this.  It came ahead of schedule! And packaging was great! However the product was not up to par. The lighted portion did not have an attachment, so the &#34;lighted&#34; keyboard is not lighted. And too many of the keys were misplaced. There are no &#34;question, or slash&#34; button, there's no &#34;@&#34; button. Many other buttons were misplaced or missing.  It is a disaster to type!"
2.0,"I had one of this previously, one of my favorites. This one failwd quick but there is a new one in black."
1.0,My great granddaughter loves it
5.0,"My gf wanted music on here phone so I got her this, she hasnt put any music on her phone yet so I cant say how well or not this works, but the phone recognized it and its been sitting in there for a couple months now."
2.0,"Constantly drops wifi, my son has a difficult time using it and keeps downloading items he doesn't mean too maxing out the storage. Its not user friendly. I should have went with an Android or iPad."
3.0,Decent drive. However it's kind of slow on boot up.
4.0,"It works great, good size good  and good price. Only giving it 4 stars because it is a &#34;little&#34; slow to write and read from but it is to be expected from an XC card with speeds up to 10mb/s I believe."
2.0,Easy to install but slow as a snail.
3.0,"Returned,  too tight."
2.0,Looks cool but is very slow.  Takes about an hour per gigabyte to transfer anything.
3.0,Can fit about anything in the case and great wire management the only down side is that all the stock wires are cheaply made.
1.0,".What a POS company NetGear is. I've been a Amazon loyal for years and buy lots of stuff, but this vendor has put me over the edge. I really wish I went through Amazon and not NetGear for the return. 5 phone calls later trying to fix a issue, I get hit with, I need to pay for your defective product return, and I get a reman item. Holy Crap. That's like calling Chevy, Ford  for a warranty issue and they say, you pay to tow it in and we'll fix it. Totally unacceptable, and I'm extremely disappointed. I run a very large contracting company, and I would've been out of business years ago treating customers this way, I really hope that is made right, as I really don't wanna post about this on a 170K plus member that I'm a member of."
2.0,"I grew tired of renting my modem/router from my ISP and decided to purchase this model.  I don't have extensive knowledge of modem/routers but I knew I was looking for VDSL (required by my ISP) as well as AC and usb ports which this model has.  The hookup was easy but I had to call customer service to try and find a couple settings during the initial setup.  This is outsourced to another country (India) and when they called me back, I had already resolved the issue so I can't comment on whether they were helpful or not.  The modem/router works as intended and I've not had any issues.  I &#34;cut the cord&#34; and this streams my shows without any problems.  The signal is strong enough for my home which allows me to connect my Roku, 3 smart TV's, 2 cell phones, 2 notebook computers, 2 cell phones and 1 tablet without any problems.  I've only had it a couple weeks so I'm not sure about reliability but I'm hopeful it will stand up for many years to come.  Overall, I'm happy with the product and would have to recommend it to others looking for a reasonable alternative to renting their modem/router from their ISP.  Update:  This product was working well in the beginning and I was happy with my purchase.  Then it started to drop the internet connection but mostly it was when I was streaming a movie or tv show.  The dropouts began to increase to a point where I often get dropouts as much as every couple minutes when I'm streaming movies or music.  If I'm surfing the web, it seems to be fine most of the time.  I'm just not satisfied with the performance of this product and I know all my settings are correct because once I experience a dropout, it resets itself in about 10 seconds and works like nothing ever happened.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product and I suggest you consider a name brand router that will meet performance expectations.  I will be buying a new modem/router from a company I can trust."
1.0,"This memory card is not Class 10 Speed. It is not 32 GB! It is 8 GB! It's fraud! It fools the computer into thinking it has 32 GB, but all files on last 24GB of all cards are always corrupt! The 8GB's that function somewhat are painfully slow and takes 10 times to 20 times as long to write to as it should, if not more time than a class 10 micro SD card should. If you think you can live with that you're wrong, because 3 out of the 3 cards I brought, opened and used started reporting errors one at 33 days and the other at 40 days and last today about day 65. I tried to use windows to repair them, but now they're all telling me drive corrupt reformat when I try to use them.. But they won't format. I tried the regular way and because that kept telling me I didn't have privileges to format drive when I tried, I tried with windows disk manager because that usually works when that is reported. It didn't. So you will lose all data you have stored on these cards either by having to reformat them or by not being able to access the data on them. Do yourself a favor and by a brand name like Kingson. I bought 5 of those and they operate as advertised. Also I looked online and can't find the warranty for these defective cards anywhere to get them replaced."
1.0,"***** UPDATE 10/14/2015  Stopped working after 1-1/2 months. . .Worked great for my application until then -- Dropped my Rating to 1 Star from 5.  ALSO -- Notice how incredibly many reviews are for a free (or discounted) product - The manufacturer would make sure THOSE worked.  My paid-for one didn't work long. *****<br /><br />BUT YOUR RESULTS MAY VARY depending on circumstances.  --I didn't know these USB/network cable adapters existed until I recently saw and bought them while battling to get the longest USB cord distance possible for my wireless network adaptor without so exceeding the USB standard that the thing failed to work.  My understanding of the USB standard is that a 16 foot cord should be the max. without adding a powered hub.  I found that 25 ft. (using 15 and 10-foot extension cords together) worked fine with my network adapter (I guess the adapter doesn't take much power and the USB signal is robust enough for the distance) but I wanted longer.<br /><br />I bought these adapters (which seem well made and tough), made-up a 50-foot Cat5 network cable, connected everything and the network adapter works fine at the end of it.  And making one's own network cables is dirt-cheap compared to USB extension cables, which seem to max out at about 15 feet anyway.  The network cable is tougher, too.  I use a freeware wireless-signal-strength analysis program to check the network adapter's performance and the signal delivered over the cable to my computer reads strong and efficient.<br /><br />The only thing is these adapters hark back to the old, slow USB 1.1 standard so what one gets with today's USB 2 and 3 probably is a guess.  USB devices requiring more power than my network adapter or sending weaker signals to the computer might not work well.<br /><br />The bottom line is, for a given length of network cable attached to these USB adapters and a given attached USB device -- If it works...then celebrate. . .if it doesn't work, too bad."
2.0,"Case is Very nice, however said it would fit my 15.6 Dell inspirion 3000 series & it does not."
3.0,"For me, this card is unstable. It only became useable for me once I reduced the voltage and the clockspeed. That's dumb. A top-of-the-line (at the time) card should be stable."
1.0,"This product should not include the word &#34;charge&#34; in its description, as it does not function as such, not in a USB port on a laptop, nor a car battery port, nor a wall charger unit.  I'm particularly disappointed because I opted for expedited shipping, as I'm on the road with no charger and that's the one thing I needed this product to do."
5.0,I bought this when it was on a special deal.  Am happy with my decision to purchase this and do recommend it.
1.0,Stopped working in two weeks.
1.0,"I purchased this card as part of upgrading my computer to Windows 10. I am not a gamer, but I do use AutoCAD and other business applications. Regardless, I'm going to return this card because the drivers continually and repeatedly fail with a Kernel Mode Driver failure. Doing a web search for the problem results in web posts dating back for a couple of years. Many of the fixes recommend updating the driver. Other fixes suggest only installing the graphics driver and not the 3D nor Physix drivers. I've tried all that and still have the problem. As a final comment, the error appeared under Windows 7 before I upgraded to Windows 10. This problem has been around a long time for this adapter."
2.0,"UPDATE: I am past the warranty but should have swapped for a cooler that had a new fan.  It's difficult to tell how much dust will settle between the fins of this heatsink until you have blown clouds out with air, wiped clumps physically from edges, and still can swab endlessly with 91% Isopropyl without the lint-free tissues coming away less filthy. I am having serious thoughts about my next investment in cooling being an easy-to-view liquid system that would not hold so much dust against my processor in difficult-to-reach areas.  Still, I realigned the fins and and did what I could to clear blockage behind the fan and remounted it for what is likely to be its final few days--unless I am pinching pennies for my side-project cooling.<br /><br />Pre 11-2015:<br />I am pleased with the performance of this cooler; it fits in the Corsair case I am using and only eliminated one of my fans.  The heatsink covers much of my mainboard and can be an issue; the fins can bend from cables pressing on them and it makes plugging fans into my M5A97 R2.0 a task for needle-nosed pliers.  My biggest complaint for this cooler is the dust it collects and how cleaning it can be a chore; this was before a gap was found and repaired between my AC and register; that brought extra dust into the room that was filtered by my EVO."
2.0,"Works, but was falling apart as I installed it.  I received a call from the manufacturer asking for my feedback, and when I told them this they said they would refund my money, but they never did.  I feel this is a unreputable vendor and would not recommend."
5.0,Works great in my GoPro3 camera. No dropped frames so far.Arrived on time. Good price. Would recommend this item.
3.0,This mouse worked great for the about 4 months. After 4 months of using it for about 30 hours a week the scroll wheel stopped working.
1.0,"I got the micro sdcard 64gig, I reformated to fat32 and works very well on my galaxy s2 i9100 with no problems at all, thanks:DEDIT: After 7 months of using this memory card, now i tried to format it but it wouldn't, i tried about 5 different methods and none of them worked, i wouldn't recommend buying this one: SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging - SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A. Avoid buying it or you will experience problems in half a year."
4.0,"A nice looking, yet protective case. I especially like that it wakes up when you open it and sleeps when you close."
4.0,worked very well
5.0,I bought this memory card to be used in my GoPro Hero3 Black.  I couldn't believe how small the card is!  SanDisk isn't kidding when they say &#34;Micro&#34;.  I've taken photos and videos all over California and its worked without issue.  Definitely worth the investment!
4.0,"Great product, Keep a shopping list and take a photo with your phone just before.  Perfect scratch pad.  I could also envision some good doodle party games with this."
1.0,Worked for one day and then the flash  drive corrupts your files and you can't  recover them. Highly recommended  you DON'T  BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4.0,not for me
1.0,"Bought this for my 7 year old son and have had nothing but problems with this Kindle AND THE REPLACEMENT that Amazon sent when the first one became a brick.  The devices constantly restart which prevents any storage clean up on the things(Which is the reason the junk restarts in the first place.  Once the memory gets to a certain capacity the device decides to call it quits).  I tried multiple times to factory reset the devices in hopes of salvaging them with no luck as it would never start the reset process.  Sure I could get to the reset menu and they would both state that they are beginning to erase the information on the devices, but after a hope filled 10 minutes they would just do a soft reset and revert back to the previous state without restoring back to factory settings.  My husband has spent hours digging through forums to a solution to this problem, but alas nothing seemed to work.  I have tried to just get another kindle of equivalent value that is not a kids edition for my son, but was told that I am stuck with the Kids edition.  After all the frustration this has put us through it has made us realize that we are now an APPLE family!"
2.0,Only one of them worked
2.0,"Skip the combined device.  This had a weak signal and dropped out often.  I use it now as a modem only, using the ASUS (RT-AC68U) Wireless-AC1900 as a router.  Both work fine in that capacity, but you can probably save some money getting just a cable modem and just a wireless router.  My experience, and everything I've read, says stay away from combined modem/routers, they just aren't up to the task."
1.0,"These criminals selling hacked SD micro cards think that they're being smarter these days.  They write more fake 5 star reviews to offset the certain 1 star ratings that real buyers will certainly give.  Then,  to make their 5 star reviews seem more believable,  they give &#34;cons&#34; in their reviews (&#34;it was great and reads fast,  but I was a little disappointed in the write speed&#34; knowing darned well that anyone reading the review will say &#34;heck,  I usually read a lot but only write once...no big deal&#34;). News flash scammers: you're still cons,  criminals,  and lacking in cerebral substance...oh,  and your slightly improved English still makes you transparent. We can spot an out of use piece of vernacular faster than a cheap 128gb SD card in a sea of real ones.  Don't buy this card.  It's a fake."
4.0,I use this keyboard as a keyboard for my test bench (Where I work on computers to repair them) and it works great! They keys are a bit mushy and close to the edge but overall for the price this keyboard is great. The plastic is high quality and so are the key caps and connector. Would buy again if I ever needed anything like it.
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule. That's always a plus in my book. The works without a hitch. I was able to copy the files from my 16GB card to this one relatively quickly and very easily. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 read the card perfectly. I have no complaints about the card although I expected the write speed to be a little faster. After all is said and done I would definitely recommend this card for your tablet, smart phone, or any other device that allows for expandable memory."
2.0,"Constant warnings that device is not charging or is not compatible or will not synch to my laptop.  Takes 3x as long, but will charge eventually to 100%. Nice how long they are tho....however I suspect that's the problem ever since I learned that extension cords can drop power over distance"
2.0,"It's ok, kind of slow when compared to other tablets.  The default user interface is actually easier to use than the child interface."
4.0,"prefect! the wires are bunched very well, although a little stiff."
2.0,"Okay so i am editing a previous review I wrote about these. Because at first they were amazing. And they still are incredibly comfortable and easy to use. But, now I'm having difficulties after five or six months of continued use. They have a connection issue now. I'm not sure with what. But when I'm connected to my ps4 it will disconnect and reconnect constantly threw the entire time I'm playing a video game or just watching a movie. I'm very disappointed that spending 300$ on these headphones has gone to waste, and wouldn't recommend buying them"
5.0,"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive)."
5.0,Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
4.0,"Good drive for the price for boosting older computers, but if it was actually for my own system I would have paid the extra for another Pro or M.2 AHCI drive, since I do notice a difference, it's not a big difference but it's still there."
2.0,I don't like this keyboard much it types odd. But it was cheap.
5.0,I have used 2 of them so far and they are great. It saves your MacBook Pro and keeps it like new.
4.0,I actually haven't gotten a chance to really use this device yet. I did hook it up and downloaded the apps for my devices and it seems like it is really easy to use.
4.0,"I really like these speaker, the fact they were USB threw me, as I am no tech junkie, and they are not the loudest even at full volume but this hard of hearing old man can hear them quite well and they put out good sound."
1.0,After 2 months stop working
1.0,I was able to use this charger twice. I received it 08/13 and by 08/26 it was broken.
1.0,"Purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage.  The one I received was DOA.  Spoke with SanDisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit.  Since it was within 30 days, they suggested I return it to Amazon instead of going through warranty procedures.  I returned it to Amazon, but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund.  The replacement appeared to work at first, but after a short while, it caused my phone to reboot, files went missing and displayed other forms of instability.  It was a bit late to return again, so I contacted Sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty.  However, this all took a lot of time, necessitated repeated copying of many GBs of data and secure erasing of information.The warranty replacement from SanDisk works well, so far.  However, I'm not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar 32GB Class 4 SanDisk microSDHC (this one is class 10).  Would probably give the current unit 3 stars, but this rating is for the Amazon delivered units (both defective).If you do get a bad one, I'd suggest to return for refund, not replacement."
2.0,"The wire wears at the plug in at the IPad, after just a few week."
2.0,"Received it, next day got boot error &#34;2100: Detection error on HDD0 (Main HDD)&#34;.<br />Pretty scare, don't know what to do - this is well known Lenovo with SSD problem, did't find solution yet.<br />If I knew, I would better buy 7200 HDD!"
3.0,The bottom pads have fallen off but it protects my computer wonderfully and it's a great color
1.0,Complete waste of money. Amazon should stop marketing these cables. They don't work. Read the other one star reviews. I won't waste anymore time talking about this bad product.
2.0,Bought this pair and they are both flaky. Fine for charging a device if you leave it sitting still but I wouldn't trust it for data transfer.
4.0,"they work, they fill my office with tunage and they cost $15."
1.0,Product arrived broken
1.0,Not for the long-term. Dead after 4 years and cannot recover data.
4.0,Great for cheap USB 3.0 drive with decent read speed of ~124MB/s but the writes speeds are slow at ~24MB/s.
4.0,Plays well with OSX... not sure if it's OSX or the adapter... but sometimes I need to restart in order for the connected drive to be recognized.  Used with CD/DVD/3.5&#34;/2.5&#34; all work well.  Speeds are max for USB2 spec.
4.0,Nice to have a stylus head that's replaceable instead of having to throw away the entire stylus when the head tears.
5.0,"This was a great deal and now I have plenty of storage space for my phone.I can store my ringtones, hundreds of songs and at least 6 movies.This is also the  new micro-SDXC Card which is designed for high speed transfer."
5.0,"Easy to use, and cheap-what more can one say?"
1.0,Holds a charge for about 10 minutes which is twice as long as the one it replaced
2.0,Cheap material
4.0,by now everythink its great
5.0,"I was able to plug it in, use the format utility and it worked just fine (this is on the galaxy s3).  Now every ounce of my ripped CD's are on my phone with 32gb  to spare.  Not much else to say."
5.0,Great Laptop at a great price.
4.0,No issues with this power cord after a few weeks of use. It seems like it's possibly made of cheaper materials than the OEM cords but for the price point I don't think you can ask for much more than what you get with this product. I would definitely recommend this cord for others looking to replace old worn out cords.
4.0,"Works quite well, a little hard to set up."
4.0,Clear case not an exact fit.
2.0,it's was okay for just one time use since it's cheap. i would recommend this to whom needs to fix their cellphones few times.
1.0,"Ordered as a 16GB, only has 7.9GB of storage! pathetic!! Also, does not have Microsoft Office as advertised. Will never order another!"
1.0,Product was not as pictured. False advertisement. Does not have the mouse insert. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
3.0,"October 11, 2015<br />I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 3 because the cable, right where the end plug is, has lost connection. They are less than two months old. I can move the wire around to make it work but it is intermittent. This may be due to my son's habit of playing with the cord, wrapping around his fingers, etc. Or it may be due to poor design or quality. I'm not sure. If it failed because my son was playing with the cord then perhaps these won't work with us. We are headed on vacation in three weeks so I just ordered another pair of headphones.<br /><br />Remembering that our son used the Kidz Gear headset for years before they broke I'm switching back to Kidz Gear. When the Kidz Gear (two pair) broke it was the volume control in the cord that went bad. The new Kidz Gear headphones no longer have a volume control in the cord. I just ordered another Kidz Gear headset. (I later found out Kidz Gear still has a volume control, they just redesigned it.)<br /><br />Original Review<br />Good headphones for the price. The best thing I can say about these is my five-year-old likes them. They sound good, fit good, and I'm hoping the no tangle cord lives up to it's name.<br /><br />We had purchased two of the Kidz Gear headphones. The first pair lasted about two years, and the second about 18 months. That is pretty good service for a headset that is used often by a child, but... Both Kidz Gear headsets had to be tossed out due to the volume control in the cord which ceased to work. From what I can see Kidz Gear seems to have eliminated the volume control from their latest offering so they must have had too many complaints. However these Sentey were quite a bit less expensive so I thought we'd give them a try."
1.0,This flash drive broke after one use. No computer recognizes it and it pops out of the usb drive. I would highly discourage anyone from getting this.
1.0,Poor signal to to the router.
2.0,The LED's behind several keys have already started to fail.<br />Won't be buying another corsair keyboard
5.0,Great
2.0,"This charger has a loose connection between the AC (socket-side) cable and the brick which often comes loose and requires some unplugging and replugging to get working, and has a DC (laptop-side) cable that is waaaayyyy to short for most practical purposes. Two stars instead of one star because when the stars align, it does work."
1.0,"If you want buyers for this product, you must show the other end of the cord.  What does it look like?"
5.0,Great price! works flawless with my note 3. I love it!!! So glad I purchased this memory card. A must have to expand your memory on your phone.
3.0,"These headphones provide really nice sound, and the noise cancelling is pretty decent. And they are nice and lightweight.  But I found them to be uncomfortable after wearing them for over an hour on a long flight."
1.0,I should have researched before I purchased.  It does not work as intended
4.0,"I like it, except for the fact that it doesn't hold a charge for very long."
5.0,"Noticeable improvement to my Sprint HTC EVO LTE with this.Camera app used to have bad pictures when I shot in burst mode (several frames per second). With this card it never misses a burst picture.Also apps that have been installed to the SD card are a lot more responsive.Update:Card has died on me, as of May 12th 2013. I originally ordered this October 22, 2012. So I got about 6 months out of it. Oh well."
3.0,Works very well
2.0,"Update 3-31-16: During a rebuild process. I decided to stream line all the runs and fix some short comings from the previous build. The new build would require me to have some perfectly straight runs out of the rads and at this point is when it come to my attention that the ports weren't straight. This made impossible to run little straight runs since the fittings would be in a obvious angle destroying the aesthetics of the build. I contacted XSPC about the issue in which I received the reply that it is normal for the ports to not be straight and that I was s@#$ out of luck &#34;basically&#34;. So after some research I come to the decision of trying to forcefully bend the ports straight. A method not recommended since it can destroy the rad if not done right. Did some re-planning and decided I would only do that to one port which thankfully I was lucky to be able to do it without breaking the darn thing. Overall with this garbage of a experience I went from a XSPC fan boy to a full on hater. And next time around when I decide to redo my loop I will replace everything and will look towards other brands. And on top of that I will make sure to test very carefully radiator ports and other aspects and if any imperfections are found I will immediately return it to take advantage of return policies from places like Amazon instead of getting a stick up the A@@ from companies that do not respect the customer's warranties. It was a five star review but now it goes down to two... because it still performs okay, and looks good but if support is non existent and warranties are trash then there is nothing more to the products offered by this company.<br /><br />My last build I was using some Alphacool Radiators. They performed well but lacked on asthetics big time. So new build is going to be black and white and this radiators seemed to be the perfect fit. Whey I opened the box I was amazed. The radiator just feels like a top end product. The build quality, the painting, the connectors... I dont care if they wont perform as well. This things are amazing. Highly recomend it. Got this 360 and one 240. Once the build is done I will update the review to include the picture."
3.0,"Be very careful when you order this screen protector!  I accidentally ordered the wrong one, because it says &#34;Microsoft Surface Pro 3 12 Inch&#34;.  After looking through reviews on several different types of protectors for the Surface Pro 3, I clicked the order button and must have missed the &#34;not&#34; on a separate line in front of those words.  The outside of the packaging says nothing about the size, just &#34;Surface 3 Screen Prote... Display, 2015 Version) New&#34; which I did check to be sure it was right before opening.  I had no way to know it was the wrong size, before I opened it so now I have wasted the price - unless Sparin comes through for me, and lets me exchange it.  We'll see what happens next."
3.0,Good hard drive but not worth the price. Segate offers a 5TB  external HDD (over twice the space) on amazon for $125: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKFEEBW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER<br />This HDD should cost no more than $60.
1.0,instructions for the custom text could not be found and i paid for this without receiving anything. very confusing.
1.0,D.O.A
4.0,Its a great product does just what it is intended for although I wish it fit just a bit more snugly to my laptop as it is a little flexible which I guess is good to keep it from snapping in half.
5.0,Swapped this into my GoPro and put the 32gb card from there into my S4. In both cases I'm completely satisfied with the cards.
2.0,Stopped working after only a few months!
5.0,I use this to store music/video/pictures in my phone. Works well for that purpose. No hiccups or speed issues. Bueno.
2.0,Didn't make it six months.
2.0,"It was an ok tablet, but it would freeze every time we would try and switch apps. Going from YouTube to a game. Nothing else would be runny. Didn't end up keeping it"
5.0,"Didn't realize this was as small as it was, nice speed and great use cross device with the included adapter.  Lots of storage space for transferring files and films."
5.0,Memory cards arrived on time and I was greatly appreciative of the frustration free packaging. If people would only stop stealing the stuff off shelves then we wouldn't have to deal with the frustration free packing would we!Trued it out in my Samsung smartphone and it worked without a hitch.
3.0,"The tablet is good, no problem so far, but I got a non-functional charger!!! I think they just picked up a random charger, because it is not even manufactured by Samsung! Other than that, I like the tablet. I hope amazon will consider replacing the charger or something..."
3.0,Two defects on screen that looked like bubbles.
3.0,wasn't easy to install and i actually had to install the drives of a huion tablet in order to get this one to work and after that it worked but the pen doesn't feel that great either buttons feel low quality in both the pen and the tablet
3.0,I ordered this for my 6th grader son to use as a school bag because he loves the game. The bag looked ok but it was way to big.
3.0,"I used to use Wi-Fi and Skype would cut out a lot. These don't give me speed as fast as Wi-Fi, but I haven't had any disconnects since I bought them. Great for gaming!"
1.0,"So not 7.1. There aren't enough ports for 7.1. Also, two mic inputs? This was a return."
5.0,I bought one for my daughter and one for my daughter-in-law: they inserted them into their phones and transferred their iTunes to their Galaxy S2 and S3 phones.
3.0,"Headset is comfortable even for long duration use. Sound quality is very good. Battery life was alright, usually around 4-6 hours of use, if charged while in use took about as much time to reach full charge again. Mic was plagued by issues since unboxing, driver issues with Windows 8/10 not picking up the mic as a recording device. On the same note, Windows had issues at first with the wireless connection, but after troubleshooting there were no further issues. On/off button isn't an analog switch, needs to be held down 3-5 sec to turn on/off. On/off button worked inconsistently, some days worked instantly on first try, others took multiple attempts holding down button longer each time. Overall decent headset, but I would recommend other similar headsets."
2.0,slow as Christmas best I could get was slower than USB 2.0. 25 mbs transferring a 20 gb file.
1.0,"I was given these as a gift and am yet to get them to work. The box come with no instructions other than what is printed on the outside which amounts to &#34;plug and play.&#34; Well I tried that and they didn't work. There's absolutely not customer service to speak of (couldn't even find a phone number online let alone with the product packaging) and resorted to going to online forums to search for people with similar issues. Still without a solution, I hope some representative reads this and tries to get in contact with me. I would love to to judge these speakers on their quality and not just their inability to work."
3.0,Fired up just fine simple enough and throughput for wireless and hardwired products is great. However I am very surprised at the archaic interface just barely a GUI at all. And lack of information about connected devices or network monitor is nonexistent. The access control module seems backwards to me. Just my opinion maybe more experience with the product will provide better review.
2.0,Very low end but cheap so it works
1.0,I loved this case ... until I realized that it traps the heat. This destroys laptops.  I recommend a cover with better ventilation for the processor.
2.0,"This headset may be cheap, but it's that way for a reason. Do not recommend this to anyone"
2.0,The scroll wheel is very erratic and difficult to use.
4.0,I have always purchased SanDisk products. This works alright it went bad in 2 months and sandisk replaced it. I have not had any issues with the replacement that Sandisk sent.
5.0,"What else can I say... this SanDisk 32 GB class 10 works like a charm in my Galaxy SII i9100 (unlocked). If you're upgrading from an old smaller microSD card, I did this:1. Create a .img file of the old microSD with HDD Raw Copy Tool (freeware)2. Recover the saved .img file in the new microSD card with HDD Raw Copy Tool* Since the old microSD had only 8 GB, the new microSD card will have only 8 GB D:3. Install Minitool Partition wizard (freeware) and choose the new microSD.4. Choose the Move/Resize option.5. Drag the space to the full size of the new microSD card6. Don't forget to Apply7. Put the microSD in your phone and there you go all your stuff and apps saved to the microSD working."
3.0,Arrived broken in a plastic bag with the lamp pulled apart from the post. I fixed it and superglued it back together. It works fine now.
4.0,"I really like the cover. When I made my purchase, I thought that I was buying a cover that was actually rubber not plastic, but this cover is plastic. Even still, I'm satisfied!"
2.0,mine did not work when i received it. the only reason its 2 stars is because I was able to return it very easily and got my money back quickly.
4.0,"Exactly as advertised. Worked fine in a white unibody Macbook (13-inch, late 2009). Apple still states that the max memory on that model is 4GB (2GB x 2) but as noted elsewhere 4GB x 2 is fine."
4.0,"I purchased this enclosure to build an external drive for my Xbox one. The features are pretty great for the price,  Usb 3.0 and can utilize up to a 4tb drive. Also, it will work with a 2.5&#34; drive as well as a 3.5&#34;. The outer shell is composed of aluminum, and features an asteticly pleasing brushed look.  The inner shell that you attach the drive too is plastic.  I would have preferred aluminum as well for better heat transfer,  but the plastic doesn't seem to really hinder anything.  The front of the enclosure has a small blue led that flashes when  the drive is being utilized and stays a solid blue when it's not.  I do not find it distracting at all. I used the included instructions to attach the drive and build the enclosure,  it only took a couple min.  Before I knew it,  I was plugging it in to the back of my Xbox one and let the Xbox do its thing.  All in all this is one of the few enclosures out there that had everything I needed to build a 3.5&#34; external drive for an Xbox one and is a solid choice for those looking to do the same."
3.0,"I didn't get mine on Amazon. I got mine on the Dell website in 2010. Though it's a 5 years old, for a portable device, it's rugged, and it's way better than having to lug around a large pc."
3.0,after a month it kinda dies fast but it worked
1.0,"Battery was great at first, but then died. Didn't even last a month. Poor product."
2.0,"I received four Kindles. All had some variation of dust under the screen, pin hole dots that light up, or uneven lighting. It's seriously disappointing considering the Kindle Paperwhite 3 is an absolutely amazing product, but the quality control during manufacturing ruins the product."
3.0,"Lasted about 8 months of daily use in my Android phone. But yesterday it stopped performing writes and then failed altogether. While it was working, reads were incredibly fast and writes were pretty good as well."
4.0,it was ok but it came in a really big envelope wastes trees
5.0,Love it in my new Samsung Galaxy S5 phone.
4.0,"Great bag, just really small, my charger can't fit inside the bag"
1.0,The battery stop charging in less then a month time of my purchase
5.0,"Got this for my Galaxy S3 android phone. As with most all San Disk products, it is high quality and I don't expect any problems."
4.0,"Quick little puppy, SanDisk makes nice quality stuff with one exception.The adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after 4 days.Adapters, psh!But my Transformer likes it, treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system (a recent store bought one wiggles?!?)"
5.0,I bought this little memory card reader and it did a great jib.
4.0,I bought one of this tablet for my 1year old son. It is a very good tablet for the price and it is easy to use for a child. Only problem is it doesn't have bluetooth connectivity.
5.0,Ultra quick. You can take several pictures in sequence and this memory keeps it pace. Even at movies it shows its speed.
2.0,It came scratched even the it says it was anti-scratch
3.0,great!
1.0,"Bought this for Galaxy S3, worked like a charm for 3 months & then I started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there, went on like this for a week or so & then one day gone. Initially I thought it was problem with phone. Popped in a 2Gb card from BB & it worked. Popped this one into the BB & same, no detection. After spending so much on an SD card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period."
4.0,Ok - but wan't the best choice for the build so I returned it.  There's nothing wrong with the memory.  It was just going to be a lower end chipset in a high heat environment and I thought better of the choice.
1.0,fell out of the socket by just the weight of the cord.. You had to hold it just right to get a charge.
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for to upgrade the memory of my smartphone. Good transfer speeds to using SanDisk product, and great pricing from Amazon."
1.0,"Setup only took about 20 minutes. Not bad. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was positive about this. I tried to go with the Windows 10 upgrade. After 3 hours, the download part had only progressed about 25%. I stopped the download, and went ahead with my regular light web browsing. Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength.<br />A couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times.<br />This evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was &#34;Welcome&#34; for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back.<br />My tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap. Spend a couple hundred extra, and you probably won't be disappointed. In this case, I definitely got what I paid for, and that is the most expensive paperweight."
1.0,not a good quality one.. i bought is few months back and now its gone .. can't charge my phone ..its gone bad now..
5.0,"With the upgrade to Windows 10, I am totally satisfied.  Big keyboard, number pad, sound, Internet.  All working beyond what, a short time ago, could not have been possible for $300."
3.0,The two credit card slots were not functional because they were not properly cut or slit during production. And there was a reddish ink? stain on the front cover.
5.0,"MikroTik is a serious contender for replacing Cisco 1900, 2900 and 3900 series routers and even newer series Cisco routers.<br /><br />In head-to-head comparisons with a Cisco 2901, the MikroTik CCR sustains much higher packets-per-second and overall throughput with less CPU utilization.  While Cisco enterprise feature set can do more than MikroTik, if you're using Cisco IP base license and even the security license, you should find just about anything you need in a MikroTik CCR.  It will take some time to get used to but you'll be rewarded.  The only drawback in this platform is WAN connectivity.  There is no option to put modems, T1 cards, etc. in the MikroTik.  It is Ethernet only but they don't purposely throttle the performance like Cisco has done for many years.  If you can get T1 delivered in Ethernet via Adtran or similar, use MetroEthernet and Internet connections, you're in a great position to have achieve really great performance at a lower price than Cisco.  I've been using Cisco since the 90's and use them in small, medium and large deployments but sometimes you just need something with higher performance at a great price.  MikroTik has been the best solution.  We have large deployments in networks with over 30 MikroTik routers from the smallest to the CCR and we've been extremely satisfied."
3.0,Used it with Adobe Connect.  The ball unit is very fragile and the gears can strip if you are not careful.
2.0,Not much room inside for a tablet. Especially if you have extra items. Go for the next size up. Besides the space issue its a quality product.
5.0,I tried this both on Android tablets and the MS Surface.Pros:-True Class 10 read and write speeds-Works with Android phones/tablet and the new Surface tabletCons:-None so far.
2.0,one side failed within a year
1.0,"The external itself feels very sturdy and well-made. However, the very first time I did a data transfer from my computer to the external, my computer made an automatic update and restarted during the transfer. Not all of the files got transferred to the external, and there was no trace of ANY of the files in my computer so that I could try transferring them again. The files appear to have been deleted off of my computer. Luckily, for these files, I believe I can re-download them from online storage and get them back, but if they'd been lost forever to me, I would be pissed. Please be aware. Edit: I left 3 stars originally, but now it's a 1. Shortly after I had written this review, the drive failed to be recognized on my Windows computer. I didn't do anything to it, I booted up my computer, attached the USB, and suddenly it won't open. The computer is also fairly new, so I do not believe issues from the computer are the problem. I did not buy this item for more frustration."
3.0,"I bought these so I could plug my earbuds into the female, and plug one male into my phone (for music) and the other male into a desktop at college (for videos). When I have music and a video playing at the same time, the quality of both just turned to crap. I bought three of these, and it's the same for all. I might be able to find another use for them, but they don't work for what I intended them for."
4.0,"I swapped the ram from my MacBook Pro using this device, nothing fried so I assume it works fine. I used it a second time trying to fix a loose hinge and the motherboard unfortunately fried. Although, to be honest, I believe that happened through fault of my own."
2.0,Chinese crap
4.0,"I needed something that could hold two laptops and then some. This fits the bill perfectly. I am holding a windows laptop and a macbook air in the main compartment with room to spare. Plus, it has another compartment and plenty of little pockets to put small stuff like cables, drives, whatever in. Plenty space and it looks great and feels well made. My only complaint is that it does not have a padded should strap."
5.0,Almost a year with this card and no problems so far. I used first with my GN 2 and now with my Note 10 2014 edition. Fingers crossed.
2.0,UNABLE TO UPDATE WINDOWS 10 unless your some sort of computer geek uninstalling and reinstalling and uninstalling... windows update kills the storage space. Out of box after updates i have 10gb of space left
1.0,junk!
3.0,"Very good for the price. I like that it is glare-free. I prefer the controls on the original Kindle, especially the buttons on the sides. Newer kindle has touch screen to change pages which doesn't work very well when using a waterproof bag. Convenient size but screen is too sensitive to touch."
2.0,"The arm is way to stiff, it takes both hands to adjust it."
2.0,"I purchased this keyboard and expected black letters and received hot pink with white letters, very disappointed"
1.0,Very cheap cable with ethernet connectors.  The wires inside are not twisted pair and are very very thin.
3.0,"I ordered a black one, but got a brown one.  No really big deal, it is a dark brown.  Works like it should."
3.0,It worked well with the ipad.
2.0,"I like the idea of this better than the actual item. The joints all require adjustment frequently to hold the position. Each joint requires a different sized tool, all of which are included, but still a bit of a pain."
2.0,I thought these were awesome and it said it was compatible with iPhone but one of the cords doesn't charge because my device says it doesn't support the charger.
4.0,Worked perfectly. Arrived when stated. Worked on Windows 8.1 and also on Windows 10 when upgraded.
2.0,"Backpack felt VERY cheap. The inside dividers were really thin, zippers felt cheap like they would get stuck. Usually AmazonBasics items are great budget items, but I would avoid this one at all costs"
3.0,I like it but it was delivered dirty as if it was used
4.0,What a great value and easy to use.  I bought this to backup my Synology Diskstation.
2.0,Yes its clear but susceptible to getting scratched easily making it less appealing. I will try the clear rubberized case. Just received it and like it already. We'll see how it stands up to everyday use and abuse.
1.0,Flimzy.  Not worthy of the Anker name.  3 out of 6 are already broken at the m-USB side..  These are nowhere close to quality of OEM cables that come with your phones and tablets.
3.0,"The keyboard is delightful, super comfortable, and the separate number pad is super handy.<br /><br />But there are significant issues with &#34;ghosting&#34; where holding down even 2 or 3 keys at the same time can cause weird behavior.<br /><br />For example, a key combination I use frequently - capslock+alt+s (I re-map control to capslock because it's more ergonomic to move my pinky a little bit than to curl it under my wrist) - simply doesn't register at all.  Another combination that I discovered playing a video game: right-arrow+space+d.<br /><br />Many keyboards have issues with ghosting when subjected to stress testing, but this one has a half-dozen combinations I need to consciously work around that I discovered through regular use.  I really hope that Microsoft does another iteration (perhaps with a &#34;gaming&#34; label, since that's what it seems to take to get anti-ghosting configurations) that fixes these issues, because otherwise the keyboard is just fantastic."
4.0,This is pretty much what I wanted. A backpack that was slimmer than the Ful backpack I previously used. I miss the multiple zippered compartments though. I wish there were more quick access front pockets although the lumbar pocket is pretty handy so far.
1.0,"These are only good because its a pack of different lengths.  BUT BEWARE...they stop working after a couple months.  I constantly have to unplug and re-plug or turn the plug over just to get them to work, which kind defeats the purpose of the new lightning cable where you don't have to care which side is up it should work either way.  It is a good product if you only need it for a couple months."
4.0,Nice item
3.0,Works well for my setup and allows for full length GPU. The bad this is the paint job is horrendous. It's like a toddler painted it. I worked for a performance auto parts maker when I was younger and this would have neverrrrr passed QA. I don't think I'd pay $70 for it again. A little disappointing seeing as its the center of my home theater setup.
1.0,Don't work.  I wish I could return it.
2.0,It is a great concept BUT the track ball consistetly skips after a few months even when I clean it.  Over time I find that I am cleaning it every few minutes just to keep it from skipping.  Other than a nonfunctional mouse it is wounderful.
3.0,"This is a neat little tablet. It does just about everything I was hoping it would but I do have some issues with the digitizer not working at times and having to reset the unit to get it to come back. After checking online it looks like this is a common issue. Since I bought it to mainly use the stylus for not taking and project documentation in my shop this was a bit of a disappointment. Also, there are no regular sized USB ports on this device like there are on my 7&#34; winBook. You can use an OTG cable to hook up USB devs but there is only one port for charging/usb/etc. Other than that it's fast, the screen looks good, when the digitizer works it works well and it's a welcomed addition to my workbench where a large full size laptop or tablet would be a nuisance."
5.0,"We got this for a friend, and I gotta say, Synology makes a damn fine product.  While this product probably isn't even made anymore, it's still going strong, and I am still amazed at how useful it is."
1.0,Extremely poor fit. Cables have to be moved back and forth to make connection and even then it's hit or miss.
5.0,"very good product, excellent quality, is the original and it works perfect on the phone. I recommend it to anyone who needs a good memory for your phone."
1.0,"Product does not fix my laptop as CWK description. Can not return or get my refund because I do not have tracking number, I sent it regular mail therefore I do not have tracking number."
3.0,Good price. Works as expected. Nothing much more to say abt a MicroSD card honestly. The frustration free packaging is really good. Definitely better than the retail packaging.
1.0,"This was delivered during the summer at our school.  When it was opened at the beginning of the school year the pen had a battery already inserted inside which had corroded and ruined the pen.  I understand that it was past the time for returns, but it was also suppose to be in unopened box with the pen and battery separate.  I am not looking for any replacements because of the late date."
4.0,Great case for a Raspberry Pi or Pi2. Well made and fits together nicely.
2.0,The plastic material felt cheap and unpleasant to my hands.
1.0,Charger didn't work on arrival. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it so I just bought one at my local electronics store. It did arrive in a speedy fashion though.
3.0,Read speed are nice; write speeds are ridiculously slow.  Beware...
1.0,"I had bought the 32GB card here on sale.  It ran great for the first 4 months.  This afternoon it unmounted from my Samsung SGS III.  I powered the phone down, re-seated the card, powered up and it was still not recognized. Powered back down, pulled the card and popped it into the computer and it showed a single partition of 0 bytes. Mounted the card back into the phone and booted into recovery (my phone is rooted with CWM), where I double checked that it could not be mounted or formatted. I then tried to re-partition the card but no luck. Phone is back up and running fine on a spare 8GB card so no problems there.  It doesn't matter how good or how fast the card is if it dies this quickly. I had most of my stuff backed up so no major loss, but I am out the cost of the card..."
5.0,Works well
5.0,I really loved the display Nd how light weight it is.
1.0,"at first it was great and simple. it was easy to connect and what not but sometimes it would lag a bit and stuff but after a couple of days, for some reason it just refuses to light up and connect with my computer. so its a bit fustrating, its not the best.."
2.0,"The first thing I'd like to point out, is that unlike the picture of this item, the cables I received do not have a rubber guard over the clip, so minus two stars for the false advertising. The next problem, is that the first one they shipped me was non-functional, so I had to return it (minus another star). The replacement cable actually worked, and does what it's supposed to, so no further complaints."
3.0,"I feel a little cheated, they state that this is the best for android phone yet it failed. I never even removed.i have had other memory cards last me years upon years.  Have to look for another one so disappointed. The phone moved smoother but not sure it is worth it"
5.0,I received the item quickly. I installed it using the cd provided and it works great.  It is so small that I forget that it's there.<br /><br />I recommend these for anyone looking for wireless USB adapter.
4.0,"This mouse has a pretty awesome battery life so far.  I think I've been using this for a month now with 1 battery and it's still running strong.  Love the fact I can program and G buttons on the side to whatever I want.  The game detection doesn't work too well in my opinion but the only game I play is League of Legends so I can't say much about other games.  The only thing I don't like about the mouse is that it is quite heavy.  Because of the weight, using the mouse for a long period does take a toll on you.  My wrist and arm would feel tired from using such a heavy mouse and using it to play League of Legends isn't something that would help improve your game.  All in all, I wish the mouse would weigh less and had hyper scrolling but at least the battery life is great."
2.0,Did not work with my MAC as advertised.  I tried working the problem out with the seller with no results.  I returned it to Amazon.
3.0,It's ok I guess I never bought this but I have had good luck with other toshiba products
3.0,Was the right cord for the job. Prime shipping would have given it 5 stars
3.0,"I thought every app could be transferred into the sd card but no. The description said that I would speed up the device a little but I think it got slower, I have samsung device and its not faster at all and not improving it also. I love this sd card I realy do RECOMMEND IT. But there are some pitty partsnto it. Still love it~~"
5.0,Fast recording/downing speed. You can't go wrong wit this. It also can be used with my smartphone.I would recommend this to a friend.
3.0,The mousepad works great. The top surface of the mousepad started peeling back the first week i got it. It is almost peeled halfway off and I've only had it for a couple weeks.
4.0,Not a bad computer for the price. The zoom on this thing goes crazy but I've noticed that most PCs do.
2.0,"Broke after one use. Customer service, well it took awhile, but they have decided I have a faulty cable. They are sending one, said it would take 5 business days.. for a brand new drive...  not cool. If it isn't the cable, then we will see, its still under warranty. PS if you have a Mac as I do you will need to run Disk Utility to format it for Mac. Something it neglects to state in the &#34;dots&#34;."
4.0,"It's ok. Office 365 for one year, except you can't use Power points 2013 on the laptop. HP drop box not worth it . HP is now cancelling their drop box in October 2015, I just purchased HP Stream 13 in April 2015.  Included $25 gift card for the Windows Store from Microsoft however, Microsoft then emails you several times to let you know if you do not use your gift card within the first eight weeks after you register for Office 365, they remove from your Windows Store account the balance of the gift card. The minimum amount for the maintenance on the HP Stream 13 Laptop for one year is $149. There is only 2GB memory, one app from the Windows Store and you are then out of disk space. Microsoft customer support team suggests you purchase he external hard drive for $119 plus tax. T-mobile free 4G data for life except you can only use that for 200MB each month, so make sure there are no other programs running at the time you might need to use your free 200MB broad band connection. You will only be connected for about 20minutes."
4.0,"The card works well. Purchased 64 GB to use in my phone as that will store a lot of pix and tunes! Ah, but the phone does not recognize the 64, and I can only use about half the memory."
2.0,"The product is OK, but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 MB/sec.  Most applications probably don't need to hit 10 MB/sec, but my GoPro Hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes.  As tested, my card got between 8-10 MB/sec using the larger block sizes.  I complained to Sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which I did (and took almost 2 weeks), but the replacement behaved the same way.  I would say this card is OK for most applications, but if you need top end speed, I would go with another card.  I bought my card in May 2013 and had it replaced in August 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now."
5.0,"Well, it's a SanDisk. Never had an issue with one and this one was no exception. Good product. Good price."
3.0,"Mixed feelings on this one. The case exterior is great, thick and very durable. Gasket is good, hinge is good, clasp it solid as a rock. The only problem is that it doesn't hold the SD cards firmly. When you open the case, at least one and usually three cards are flopping around inside. The case has two jobs: 1) protect the cards, and 2) hold the cards. It does #1 exceedingly well. #2, not so much. The picture attached shows what I usually see when I open up the case."
5.0,Love this mouse
5.0,Great
4.0,"Pretty good, I like it. Sturdy enough for my iPad mini."
2.0,Product works but very limited wireless range. I live in a one bedroom apartment and it is not potent enough. Get a router with more range.
5.0,Excellent...
3.0,"The product was fine.  However, it was not delivered as promised...it was delivered a day late.  I know that doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you pay extra for it to be delivered by a certain date...that is what I expect."
1.0,Potentially a great tool. But on my MacBook Pro when I asisgn tasks to a programmable button they all zoom in rather than preform the function. So far tech support can not fix the bug.
2.0,"Charges fine, however the plug is too long for the input and doesn't sit flush to the side of the tablet.<br /><br />You can see in the picture that the adaptor is charging, but sticks out ~3 mm."
1.0,"Bad fit for asus vivo tab, it is way bigger than the actual tablet. I ordered the right one as well because it says the right model type on the outside of packaging. Wouldn't recommend."
1.0,These worked did what they were suppose to but didn't even last 3months. The cord broke where it connect to the controller but you get what you pay for. Will now be buying another headset.
4.0,"Had this item for a week or so now and it seems to be working fine. I haven't put it through any kind of stress or anything, just stuck it in my phone and let it do it's thing. So far, so good."
4.0,Excellent price and quality by RAZER again!
3.0,gift
4.0,My needs are not very taxing for this keyboard/mouse pair. They are both within 5 feet of my computer. I have them on a moving platform that makes having wired units impractical.<br /><br />The keyboard does feel a bit cheap (light/plasticky) when typing but for the price and *my* needs this is fine. I don't think I'd be satisfied if this was my primary keyboard.<br /><br />I dinged this a star due to the occasional pauses that the mouse exhibits while I'm using it. I'm on a pretty high-end Alienware Windows 7 64 Bit machine with 12 GB of RAM and a potent i7 processor.  Yet inexplicably the mouse will pause in mid-swipe now and then for a second or two and then continue on as if nothing had happened.<br /><br />The machine is primarily a flight simulator and so the mouse is largely used for configuration instead of day-to-day surfing and working so this works well enough for my needs.
2.0,"Since Kindle Keyboard, I've been frustrated and unhappy with every model I've tried. I don't use my Keyboard anymore because I need better contrast and lighting. I've been using an iPad Mini with the Kindle App, but have been looking for a lighter-weight alternative.  This time around, despite the nice lighting, light weight, and text clarity, I disliked the haptic page turning. My unit froze while in setup so I had to restart and configure manually, without the tutorial. I was frustrated that once I linked to my Goodreads account, it threw a page of books at me, all check-marked to send samples to my device. I tried to un-check the checks, but that's when it seemed to freeze. After resetting, Goodreads seemed not to let me bypass the samples page, so once I managed to un-check them (extremely slow responsiveness), the button to continue was obscured and so I ended up anyway with a bunch of samples I didn't want, cluttering my Cloud list. Also because I couldn't find out online which ads on my Kindle were considered &#34;recommendations&#34; vs. ads, I had Customer Service call me. It then took an hour for the patient representative (a supervisor) to determine the answer to my question: Was the band of ads at the bottom of the homepage removable with vs. without purchase of ad-removal? After some more resets and such, we discovered the answer together, by default. Finally, with my ad-removal purchase they were gone.  Then I began downloading a couple hundred of my Kindle books, but by the time I got them organized I had realized how slow and unresponsive the device was with page-turns and navigating the menus. That, together with all the other problems and not liking the pre-determined brightness on automatic setting, I just gave up on the whole darned thing."
3.0,"I have purchased two of these drives and am having problems with both drives. I was going to send the first one back via RMA until I realized they want me to pay to ship it back. I have had two other external hard drives by a different well named brand, which are now too small for my needs, that lasted me eight years with no problems, guess I'll go back to the better brand."
4.0,"Pros:<br /> - Well made<br /> - Easy to use<br /> - Charges both my Macbook and any USB powered device (cell phone)<br /> - Decent charge (I get maybe 1 1/2 charges on my laptop)<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Heavier and bulkier than I had hoped<br /> - Too many cables, it takes three cables plus the charging box for full operation, which is too much to travel with. I usually only take the charger and cable that connects to recharge my laptop, which is fine for most cases."
4.0,Bought it as addition to my tablet Samsung Note 10.1 edition 2014. IS great for storing pictures and....... Very good at a reasonable price.
3.0,"Yay windows 7, but seriously, that processor? It gets overwhelmed by everything, not a multi tasker. Struggles with Netflix and I wouldn't dare try photoshop. Aesthetically, it's a nice computer, light and convenient. Decent battery life, not great. Definitely a bargain computer for a reason."
4.0,"I mean, its obvious lies, this whole 64GB thing.. you get maybe 60 if you are lucky..Seems to work ok so far."
4.0,works just well as an addition monitor for my security system
1.0,"Within a week, the rubber ear pieces came off and there is NO way to attach them back on.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"When I removed the drive from the package it was obviously refurbished and handled roughly; it had dents, smudges, and mangled tape.<br />But I installed it anyway.<br />Big surprise... it did not work.<br />It labored to accept discs and spin them.<br />Ultimately, the wii gave me an error.<br />I returned this item."
1.0,"Not as pictured. What is pictured is a high quality OEM cable. What I received is a cheap, made in China junk wire cable which was DOA with one of the power conductors not in continuity (tested with Fluke meter).  No option for return of defective product -- really Amazon?  R U kidding?  Update:  contacted Amazon directly and they immediately issued a refund and just had me discard the bad cable.  I hope they don't have to take the hit for a crappy product but very happy with their customer service!  So....buy from Amazon, just don't buy this!"
2.0,I don't like that I only have a certain amount of time to read a book.
1.0,"As soon as I plug it in, it started making noise. I'm worried that it'll explode or something. Definitely return it!"
5.0,"I needed a place to shove all my music videos for party portability. The write speeds are around 10-12MB a second, so it's no barn burner, but read speeds are good enough to playback 1080p content, and that's what really counts to me."
2.0,"Not what is pictured.  This is a micro to micro extension, NOT a micro to SD extension.  I managed to get it to work, but just be warned."
4.0,great price
4.0,Good price
2.0,"After I inserted the micro SD card to the adapter I can no longer removed it from the adapter. It was stuck inside the adapter permanently. I definitely received a defective item. I also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectors.Another, while I was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an error.Sandisk's quality control department should up their game. They're selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed (not all of them BUT a lot of them). It's just not me. I also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective."
1.0,Would not recommend. The magnet is so strong that if you fold the cover around the back to hold it comfortably it turns the iPad off.  Pretty poor design or manufacturing in my opinion.
5.0,Got this to go in my daughters Microsoft Surface RT and it is doing great! She loaded a movie on it and is happy her device has some extra memory :-)
5.0,"Has worked like an absolute charm in my PSP, and for the on going reduced price, I ended up buying a 2nd for my new Samsung Tab 3 even though I didn't need the extra storage (yet)."
4.0,"Good speed, does what it needs to do without problems. Continuous shots are great with such speedy card."
3.0,"I will begin by saying that I have successfully installed many many screen protectors on different devices, so I know how the process works. Installing this screen protector was by far the most annoying and difficult. Firstly, the steamy shower did nothing to improve the dust situation on the screen of my paperwhite, and neither did the small sticky tape that was provided with the kit. I had so much trouble with my first screen protector, I had to throw it away. It's a good thing I got a 2 pack. I painstakingly repetead the cleaning and dust removal process, but continued seeing lint and dust under the protector. On a whim, I used my own screen cleaning cloth, and the protector finally adhered correctly, with no air bubbles. I am pretty sure that the screen protector itself is fine, but the cleaning cloth that comes with the kit leaves more junk on the screen than it removes. The sticky tape they provide is useless. This protector is on the expensive side, and I am really annoyed with the quality and the size of the cleaning cloth and tape that came with it. The irony of this review is that if (and that's a big IF) by some stroke of luck you manage a flawless installation, this screen protector is great. It is invisible, and  somehow seems to improve the touch performance of the kindle paperwhite screen. There is no glare, the protector does not affect the look of the screen. Some reviewers noted that the protector size was too small, but I disagree, the size is perfect for my 6 generation Kindle Paperwhite. There is a tiny but if a difference, under 1 mm, but it is barely noticeable, and designed so that protector can be removed from the screen."
1.0,Motherboard is awesome. Everything is great. Except one thing. During startup my fans like to turn on and then shutdown. Ive updated everything and it still does it. Buy if you like to heat up your cpu.
4.0,"So far, so good. No complaints, does what it is supposed to do."
5.0,Working as described and what a great price!  Would buy from them again.
1.0,iPhone 6 shows error - cable not certified- does not work
5.0,fast quick does what it's suppose to do. I have placed this card in my GPro Hero 3 Black edition.
5.0,"Liked the first one I purchased so much, I bought a second one. Very, very fast read and write speeds at a good price, plus SanDisk has the best software and device compatibility.  Forget thumb drives - this is your most flexible, durable option.  Use direct in your tablet or smart phone and/or buy a decent usb card reader you can load this in and, voila, instant super-speedy, upgradeable thumb drive.  Works great in my tablet and in my newer card reader - and still kicks the butt of every thumb drive I know of even when used with my old plastic USB 2.0 card reader held together with scotch tape, lol.  Have purchased several microSD cards since they first came out, from 2GB to 32GB, and all still work fine - I cannot say the same re the thumb drives I purchased during that same time period.One point - beware of counterfeits.  Samsung is the number one brand so, unfortunately, they get counterfeited a LOT.  So check reviews and only buy from a reliable seller.  I suggest buying direct from Amazon (or Memory Mogul) - I have purchased from both with no issues."
5.0,"For the price, this is the bast for android phone, very fast and holds alot of stuff on it.I would recomend this for phone or for camera"
5.0,Works well with my dslr. Have never been able to fill it. I guess 16gb would be enough for average use. Go for faster speeds and smaller size.
3.0,Still thankful for  the small speed improvement.
5.0,"SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card one of the best memory card I bought, how quickly and read the data back is amazing"
4.0,"The keyboard came in good condition, with the exception of one of the leveling feet was missing. I was able to remove that item from my old keyboard to make it complete. Otherwise, it functions like a new one."
3.0,"The mouse itself was quite interesting. The comfort was decent, and the size was on the large side. Sadly, it broke after a few months. I could no longer right click with the mouse."
3.0,"Works fine, but a bit noisy."
1.0,"I bought this product to go with my iMac (Late 2013). However, ran into the following problems immediately:<br />- SD card doesn't show up in Finder.  I did make sure that it was inserted correctly and tried several diff cards.<br />- SuperDrive doesn't work. OS X Yosemite showed a notification that the SuperDrive needs to be plugged into the iMac directly.<br />- a wireless mouse that has a USB transmitter doesn't work<br />The only thing that worked with the USB hub is my iPhone. I'm returning this product."
1.0,I used this for two weeks and it kept popping out my iPad. and it is not self turn off as advertised
3.0,"didn't fit my setup, if i ever get the right setup i will give more or less stars"
3.0,ok
5.0,"This card is fast, fast, fast. it also holds more photos and videos than I have been able to take thus far. However, as the number of such items increases, I can see that I will, relatively soon, be looking for a 128 or 256 gb card. Very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,Good carrying case
3.0,"FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. This drive will destroy your data.<br /><br />Plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.ctly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information."
2.0,"This is a great headset and I used it when I was on Windows 7.  The reason I give this 2 stars is that the drivers for this headset are no longer available.  I have upgraded to Windows 10 now, and the microphone does not work.  In addition, this headset is not supported from the U.S. Sades website, as this appears to be a non-U.S piece of hardware.  There are no Windows 10 drivers for this headset, so it is no longer fully functional.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - when this worked, it was great, but a gaming headset without a working mic is not a gaming headset."
3.0,Much smaller than it looked like in the photos. They were very deceiving!  Only reason I didn't send it back was that the posted dimensions were correct.
2.0,returned not needed
2.0,It's great when it works. The wireless degrades constantly. I have to reboot it at least weekly and generally multiple times before my devices will reconnect.
2.0,"Cheap brittle plastic case.  My 2.5 inch ssd flopped around in the case.  Used the extra pad to eliminate movement and all the tiny plastic tabs that make it tool less, broke very easily.<br /><br />Im glad it broke before I could take it out into the world.  One drop, I'm sure the whole case would explode<br /><br />Crap,  don't waste your time and money.<br /><br />Edit:  Inateck got back to me about the review, and offered me two different, replacement device of the same caliber but different design ((http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=551434) and our safe buying guarantee (http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=537868)).<br /><br />I chose the FE2005, it arrives and the drive still flops around.  All though they included an extra foam pad, I honestly didn't have a pair of tweezers to install it in this model.<br /><br />I went instead with the Anker (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H98AXOE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  No flop, didn't need an extra foam pad and it definitely feels sturdier.<br /><br />Edit, edit : they asked for another star for their customer service and I will do that, because they did try to make it right.<br /><br />I would further suggest a better product from them in the future."
5.0,good

1.0,I bought this item for my  MSI GP 70 Leopard 486.  I installed it but my computer  didn't recognize it.  I installed the drivers but still nothing.  I don't know if I need to buy a UBS adapter just send it back because it's defective.  I wrote to technical support  but sorry guys I don't have a 4 year degree in computer science.<br />  I wonder if only geeks buy this item

3.0,"I was actually looking for a wrist rest, and because of the way this pad is packaged, and the way it is shown on its homepage, I thought that's what it was. Oh well, at least it was'nt too expensive, and now I have a nice spare mousepad!"
3.0,"Lenovo Product Management MUST resolve Very Pesky issues that destroy the Experience of using this otherwise great laptop: (1) Disable the goddam Automatic Gesture Recognition feature. There are so many Non-Standard Gestures, that ONLY after you loose data or see weird behavior that you realize that the fricking OS is doing something on its own in the background. Very Frustrating. The system messes up my word processing Everyday. Again, Everyday the mouse jumps around because the Laptop is doing something weird in background and Mis-interprets your commands. Horrible. (2) Sit the frick down and hire some good english-speaking designers to write a Better Manual and Instructions to use the Gesture Recognition.

2.0,Not good for the hard drive because it is little bit shaky once installed it. and not good for long run.
2.0,"First, it's a beautiful case. I got the tree themed case, very pretty in person. I received my kindle paper white and this case on July 3. It's August 28 now and probably about two weeks ago the hard shell that your kindle sits in separated from the outer case. I could probably re-glue it down, but I am sure it would just keep coming apart. I would give this 5 stars if it was a more durable product. For reference, I read on it about an hour daily. Sometimes more on my days off...so I consider that somewhat light usage and would expect the case to hold up better than it has. FYI, getting the kindle out of the hard shell of this case was kind of a pain. I had to really work to get it out. My advice would be to save your money and not purchase this particular case. I have since purchased a Fintie case and I think it will work much better for my needs."
4.0,"I like that it's not bulky and provides a sleek, professional look.  The blue cover looks classy"
2.0,Cant (yet) get this to work. Still trying.
1.0,"Dead on arrival, and its been parked as a paperweight on my desk ....."
2.0,Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn't have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good
5.0,"Works as intended. I use it with my old Sansa MP3 player,and I have another one which is used with my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 android tablet and they both work fine on both devices after being formatted by the android tablet. I'm planning to buy more now since I'm an anime junkie,and anime junkies need their space lol"
3.0,"Tested with AirPort Extreme (ME918LL/A) -- the adapter only supports 5GHz channels with lower numbers (36, 40, 44, 48), which effectively cuts by half the amount of channels AirPort can choose. This is not stated anywhere, and from the first sight it appears as if the adapter just doesn't work. It's good that I have some neighbors with 5GHz networks working on different channels, some of which could be seen by the adapter, so I decided to experiment with choosing the 5GHz channel on my AirPort and made it work with the adapter. I would expect better compatibility with Apple wireless router from a product &#34;designed for Mac&#34;. Real Apple devices support all the channels offered by AirPort Extreme and doesn't require tinkering with settings."
5.0,"This case is WONDERFUL. It came very quickly and was packaged very nicely. The case snapped on very easily and is very easy to take back off if you want to remove it. The keyboard cover lays on the keyboard very nicely, it does take some time to get use to. The keyboard cover is rubbery so it did take some time to get use to but I've been using it for over two weeks now and I love having it. The keyboard cover keeps hair and dust and other things out from under my keys. It helps to keep my keyboard nice and clean. The protective screen is very nice to have, I didn't have scratches on my screen yet but when I saw that it came it was very nice to have as an extra protection."
5.0,"I had bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the 'Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to 'unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first ""Eject"" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media"". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.I cannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone."
2.0,"I bought this router through Best Buy to replace the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 that I fried.  I have a lot of devices that connect, both through wired and WiFi connections, to the internet.  This seemed like it had everything I needed.  I used it for a few weeks and ended up returning it to get the newest Netgear Nighthawk X6. The biggest reason was that this router literally cut my internet speeds in half.  I have a 100 Mbps connection,and when I plug directly into my modem, I was getting that.  I plug in through this router (only connected device, wired connection).  I was getting 50 Mbps.  My old Nighthawk had no loss in speed.  Was not happy.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great mobile app for remote management<br />- Easy to setup using the browser<br />- Smaller physical footprint<br />- Great network management page on router<br /><br />Cons (besides what I mentioned)<br />- Limited functionality when it came to customizing the network<br />- Could not log in via Safari.<br />- Had trouble with DNS on wired devices.  Had to manually set in the router.<br />- Used Flash for parts of router management (I hate Flash)<br />- made me setup an account with Cisco in order to log in to the router for the initial setup.<br /><br />This is marketed (and priced) for high-end users, but performs at a mid-range level."
4.0,"Never had a problem with any sd cards prior, and always had a good track record with sandisk products.Card was working great at first, used exclusively in my Samsung galaxy S3. Enjoyed the extra space(got the 32gb card) and transfers were pretty quick. I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) ""sd card safe to remove"" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the ""unexpected"" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it's own accord. I never thought to check it's temperature after transferring large files so I'm not sure if I had the same issue as another reviewer.Contacted Sandisk, waiting for reply. If they replace the card and it works well, I will revise this review.UPDATE: 2-28-13got a replacement card after about a week and a half, Sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus. I've had the replacement in my S3 for 3.5 months now and still going strong. I've also used it with the adapter in my goPro. Card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so. Updated to 4 stars since I haven't had a single problem with this card (the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing). Maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there."
5.0,"You can't go wrong with Sandisk and you can't go wrong with Maximum space!I love movies, so space is important."
2.0,"When the battery is charged and this 3.34 A Onite charger is providing only replacement power, it stays very hot .  When it was initially charging my fully drained 65w HP 17&#34; Pavilion Laptop battery, the adapter got so hot I could not touch it. It's main redeeming feature is that it has a two prong plug so I can use it with small extension cords when traveling.  I gave it 2 stars because it gets so hot."
1.0,"I purchased Nexus 9 right when it came out and received this cover a bit later. It protects the screen well when covered, and stays in place when it's covering the back. It also looks good. That's it for the good.<br /><br />When folded to prop the Nexus 9 up, the &#34;connection&#34; can be broken too easily with a slight bump. The magnet on either the cover or the Nexus 9 isn't strong enough. I have an iPad 2 to compare it to, and the iPad 2 never had this issue. Without the ability to confidently keep it propped up, it kind of does half of what I needed it for. I had to purchase an Amazon Basics tablet stand instead.<br /><br />Also, while covering the screen, the bottom corner doesn't stay down. It flaps ever so slightly, leaving a slight gap (pictured)."
4.0,"5Ghz light isn't on but setup said it was active??? Otherwise, working ok."
2.0,Have downloaded very little onto it and  I'm low on memory
3.0,"It doesnt like to act normaly with my PC most of the time. I have to lean really far forward sometimes, even on a full battery, to get close to my bluetooth source.Otherwise, its a pretty neat unit! It fit my needs at the ti9me, and I will probably use it again when I set up my home theater system!"
4.0,"Crucial recommended PC3-12800 for my Toshiba L675D, but it would not boot.  When I investigated further, the manufacturer and a couple of other sites said PC3-8500!  Crucial tech support was no help at all.  He said they guaranteed the recommended memory would work and recommended against using this memory &#34;because it's for a Mac.&#34;<br />Well, I've been working on computers for many years, and I know that computers can be very picky about memory.  I've learned to trust manufacturer specifications.<br />I returned the PC3-12800 and decided to try this set, since the specs matched.  (Thank you Amazon for your excellent return policy!)<br />It works!"
1.0,"Honestly I was expecting what the description says and I am so dissatisfied. The PC claims to be a gaming pc but for heroes of the storm which is not a very demanding game, I have to put everything on low and it still has issues keeping up. The keyboard has some keys that take a few times to press to work and its brand new. I was lured in by the stats but I question that those parts are even in this machine because it is not running what it says its suppose to. Would return it if I was able to. Go to best buy and get an asus vivo book instead this one is not worth the money."
2.0,"Failed in a year. Heard a popping sounds today. The plastic was very soft, and deformed under the Made in China sticker. The power supply failed under light use (less than once a week.) This is a poor quality product."
4.0,This is just what my S4 wanted! I have so many songs to take around with me that I had to get a bigger card and this one is great! No memory issues any time soon!
5.0,"Fast, easy, and great amount of capacity!!! XC is pretty quick and I am enjoying mine on my Galaxy S4 :)"
4.0,"Bought this to extend the life of an old laptop with a dead internal fan.  Without the Opolar fan, CPU temps were cresting 170°F.  With the Opolar even running at lowest manual speed, temps rarely go above 120°. With the speed tuned up a few clicks, it's rarely above 110°.  I'm really impressed with the effectiveness.<br />The &#34;auto&#34; fan speed function seems like a great idea, but unfortunately it requires a working laptop fan for it to operate.  This seems odd since I imagine that most people buy this (like I did) to replace the cooling function of a dead fan, not as a fan booster.  The auto fan speed control senses the temperature of the air being directed out of the laptop -- perhaps a future version could incorporate a temperature sensor cable that could be placed inside the laptop vent to directly sense the internal temps and control the auto fan speed that way.<br />Pros:  Simple connect and attach. Works really well at keeping laptop CPU temperatures under control. Reasonably quiet even at high speed.<br />Cons: The arms that clamp the device to the side of the laptop could be longer.  They're short enough that the weight of the Opolar itself can sometimes work them loose.  And the previously mentioned auto-speed function not working without a working internal fan.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a well crafted product and I'd recommend it."
4.0,Package arrived quickly. Heatsinks were easy to install. Great product.
4.0,"Comes with an SD card adapter.  Not much I can say about an SD card, but I would recommend it for the price!"
5.0,"Great name brand class 10 card.  Great price, best on the net at the time I bought this one.  It works perfectly and is fast.  Can't go wrong.  Spend the extra couple of bucks for the real deal.  Don't be fooled by a knock off, slow speed, import."
1.0,"It's cute and I loved that it oscillated, but either I got a defective one or these things are not meant to be used all day while you're at work."
5.0,"I can't say that the applications are loading faster, but I can definitely say that videos and music load much faster in my phone now. I didn't have to reformat the card or anything, just transferred all DATA from old card to this one and popped it in. Considering the small price difference, I'd recommend getting a faster card for sure."
2.0,"the few i tried only had one side that would connect to use,will try more later"
3.0,Flimsy
1.0,Did not fit my Samsung galaxy tab 8.4 not happy.😠
1.0,It just did not work for me.
5.0,"The product shipped fast and actually came in a few days early. I read about some people having problems with this card. When I got it, first thing I did was format it. Also make sure your device is compatible with SDHC cards. I have had no problems. Very fast read/write speeds. A little over 29 GB actually available for storage. I am pleased."
3.0,"good product, good price, does what it's supposed to.  packaging is in korean"
3.0,Not fit 100%
3.0,The case is well made and arrived in two days. The only reason I'm not giving this a higher rating is because there is no mechanism to hold the flap open such as an elastic strap. It's impossible to hold onto the handle and keep the flap open at the same time.
1.0,charger didnot last long and not good quality.
3.0,"working fully and correctly but just a little bit of unexpected issue, its showing 124g instead of 128 that it was suppose to be...."
3.0,"I bought this so I could read while walking on the treadmill.  It certainly works better than a book but it's way too small which means I have to run my finger across it every few seconds to turn the page because I need the font fairly large to see properly.  I also wish it had a handheld wireless page turner/clicker.<br /><br />Used normally, I like it.  Battery lasts a long time.  Works great in the dark or light of day.  Quite a few library books available for Kindle.<br /><br />I think I'd prefer a pair of special glasses or goggles that had book images projected on them which would allow hands-free operation."
5.0,"What more can I say. They always work for me. At one time, they were more expensive than other brands. If you look for deals, that is no longer true."
4.0,Fits like a glove.  Feels good in the hand and the auto off/on function by opening the cover is a plus.  I really like it.
3.0,It charge slow on the powerful slot.
2.0,"This cover is awesome.  It is sturdy and well made. However, it did not fit my new Samsung 7&#34; tablet (it was way too big).  I am going to have to buy another case."
4.0,"excellent tool. gave it to my daughter ,a nd my grandson said it is terrific."
4.0,A cheaper alternative than buying a tablet with more storage. Shipped promptly and the price was reasonable..I will probably purchase another.
4.0,Works great...
3.0,"I bought two of these at different times.  Both of them had the retail packaging with the Android on them and the model number matched the packaging.The first one was 32GB.  I tested this out with dd on my built-in SD card reader on my MBP and on a GFR204SD USB device and couldn't get more than 8 MB/s average write speed.  Would bounce up and down between 6 and 10.  The Class speed is supposed to be the minimum, not the maximum.  R/W off the HDD was above 20, so that wasn't the bottleneck. Neither is UHS compliant, but I should at least be able to get the Class 10 rating out of this.  Read @ 30 MB/s is pretty accurate.The second one (64GB) I tested by just watching Activity monitor to see if it was in the ballpark.  Bounced between 8 and 10 copying from a hard drive or a RAM disk.  Sounds like probably Class 10.  Read speed to RAM disk was about 24 MB/s."
1.0,"Plugged in worked fine was able to use a mice or external hard drive, but broke on the second use,<br />look for a party manufactered product.."
3.0,"Works ok. It's supposed to be the same 12W as the original I got with my iPad, but it doesn't charge nearly as fast, but it serves it's purpose for me to carry with my work bag & be able to leave my iPad charging for a few hours while I'm not using it at the office. Doesn't charge much at all when using the iPad compared to the original Apple adapter though."
5.0,"I placed his SanDisk 64GB Micro SDXC card in my Galaxy S5 phone.  My phone &#34;sees&#34; the card and tells me that the card has 64GB of space available.  So far, so good! - I'll update this review if the card stops working!"
3.0,"The color is true to the color shown on the product. The bottom cover fits, well, but the top cover and the keyboard cover does not fit as well as I would like them too. The keyboard cover can make typing awkward and is hard to push some of the buttons and feels as if the buttons &#34;stick&#34; because of it. The top cover fits a little awkwardly, but is not bad."
1.0,Charged up the case and found that the QWE buttons did not work.  Asked for a replacement and when the replacement case came found that the QWER buttons did not work!  Complete piece of rubbish.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1.0,I never could get this to sync and it was so cheaply manufactured it basically broke in the process.
4.0,nice pfoduct
3.0,"Did not fit my Infocus 10&#34; tablets.  Easy to return, prompt refund. Thanks!"
3.0,"It is ok.  Not what I would say is special. Very quiet, and reasonably fast."
3.0,bay for standred cd/dvd burner is too shallow  burner sticks out from the tower about 2 inches
5.0,This is working great in my AT&T Galaxy Note. I love having extra storage for my music videos and pictures
1.0,This item is was poorly made the connection was a press fit and it didn't have any reinforcement. It is not worth the money we only used it a couple of times and the knob pulled out of the frame.
3.0,"I bought these around 7 months ago and so far I have already sent them in for not working. and a couple weeks after I sent them in they started having more problems like sound cutting out and just sound quality lowering. The headset is some what comfortable and the mic is ok, there is a good amount of bass but the sound isnt that good. The build quality is durable but when I move the headset even slightly it makes loud creaking sounds. I would not reccomend, maybe if the headset was 40 dollars it would be considerable."
3.0,Device worked as promised. Comcast company did not. What is the purpose of an upgrade when the delivery system cannot support.
1.0,"Opened package up, inserted TROND AC2 into my USB port........guess what???  It did NOT WORK!<br /><br />I returned it immediately and will NOT buy another product from this manufacturer."
5.0,I use this to store all my music pictures and HD video on the limited storage of the surface pro and it simply works! at the price point of below 60$ I think its a steal!
3.0,"It's a beautiful case and makes my macbook look gorgeous, however the case started falling apart over last couple days... won't stay on and tabs that hold the case on breaking off. Bummed because it's so pretty. Wished they made it with better quality plastic or something."
4.0,"This kindle works well but the battery goes dead more quickly than you'd expect. Really it is a version of the previous Kindle that weighs less. The internet browser works considerably better than the previous but still has issues loading certain websites. Pop-up ads are a challenge at times. Other than that it is about the same as the older version, a good product that serves its purpose well but I wouldn't rave about it."
5.0,I have used these Sandisk Ultra Micro SDHC 16 GB cards exclusively since buying POV cameras that  require them. I have used them in Gopro Hero 3 and Sony Action Cameras.These cards are great.
4.0,nice
1.0,"Constantly looses connection, no serious PC support, the android app is pretty awful.<br />Overall this is a nice device for geeking out, but not something you could actually use.<br /><br />If they at lrast made some decent improvements to PC connectivity it might become useful"
5.0,"I purchased this to convert a VHS to a DVD, and the product did just that. The adapter worked and the included software, while not particularly fancy, got the job done. For the price, I think it's an amazing value"
4.0,"I really like the performance.  Since I put it into a USB 3.0 adapter, I get about 27MB/s actual measured throughput."
3.0,Too small
1.0,"I was impressed with the Kindle Fire the first couple of months but then it slowly became a pain in the butt to operate. I would turn it off and then try and turn it on and it wouldn't respond at all in any sort of way. I would have to wait fifteen minutes just to get a response.  I would be watching a Video and then shut it off to do some work and then go back and the video won't respond and if it does it would play the video with a black screen with just the sound playing and I would have to hold down the off button just to reset it.  If I was going to buy another Kindle I just wouldn't because I don't think its a very good Tablet in any sort of way.    Update - Now the on/off button doesn't work unless I plug it in and I have no clue why this is happening now, this just cements my feelings of thinking that Kindle Fire is the most useless tablet on the market. I was very impressed at first but then as time goes on the tablet just gets worse and worse."
2.0,"Very weak wi-fi signal.  Went from Century Link to Cox, which meant needing a cable-compatible modem.  We had strong wi-fi signal strength with the old modem, but now have almost no signal strength the other side of the house.  I've tried turning the modem in different directions, raised it up, lowered it, to no avail.  Not a happy camper."
2.0,"For about $25 you can get a true 64GB microSD memory card. For about half that price, you will invariably get a fake.<br /><br />*** YOUR DATA IS AT RISK ***<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Good 64GB SD cards are out there, but they will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.e information."
5.0,Great Price
2.0,Very flimsy plastic but adequate to mount on mini tripod on my desk for use with FaceTime
4.0,Works great.
5.0,"I was upgrading from a mid-tower but didn't want to go with a full-size tower.  This case fir the bill perfectly.  Its the same height and width as a full tower, but roughly the same depth as a mid-tower!  Win!<br /><br />Aesthetically, this thing is very nice.  Its a good solid build that feels really well made.  Everything fits together great.  The case has tons of airflow through it.  I've not had any issues whatsoever with heat dissipation.<br /><br />There is plenty of room for my MSI Gaming 5 and GTX-970.  I use an H100i GTX and there is plenty of room for the double length radiator.  The SSD's mount behind the motherboard panel, which is a nice touch, given the hard-drive cage only has two bays.  No worries about that though.  You won't have any trouble finding places to mount HDD'ss because you can order a part from Rosewill to add 6 (I believe) internal storage bays.<br /><br />All in all, I love this case.  I expect that it will be in service a long time!  If you're on the fence about this case or another, go ahead and pull the trigger on the Rosewill.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />**One note on the other reviewers complaints about the sticker that covers the fan shroud on the bottom of case. Mine had it too, but apparently Rosewill has changed from a paper sticker to a vinyl one. Mine came off with ease and in one piece."
2.0,"Worked for about 10 months.  Then it started working only intermittently, causing my laptop to indicate it had been uplugged and plugged in.  I thought maybe the connector wasn't plugging in properly, but my other chargers worked fine.  Now it mostly doesn't work and when it does the plug gets very hot.  Probably there's a bad connection between the wire and the connector inside the plug that's getting worse."
1.0,They charge my oneplus phone very very slow. At first I thought I had a defective cable so I returned it and got a replacement but its the same problem. I left it charging ask night and it did not charge all the way.  I can't even use the phone while it charges because it will die.
3.0,Much smaller than expected.
3.0,I ordered 2 and 1 was defective. Not happy!
4.0,Soved my problem when other products failed.  Great price too
1.0,These worked for about a month. None of them charge my phone now which is super annoying. Thanks a lot Qable. POS
1.0,You know what Amazon block my first review even though there is nothing wrong with my review but they blocked it because I said I would not buy refurbished would buy brand new instead. You know I have never write a bad review for Amazon but misleading public about for the products you backed for will result a law suit in your behalf. Continue in this path you will lose a long time customer. That is all I have to say.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!  FAKE!!! FAKE!!!!! FAKE!!!!!!  Does NOT come with &#34;hologram&#34; sticker on back, does NOT have bar code on back of chipboard. Chipboard is GREEN!!!!

Don't get me wrong, it might work. bit NOT ALFA..."
4.0,Use this in my GoPro 3 silver edition.  Even at 1080p/30 I get about 9 hours of video.  Write time is great and I have had no problems writing video to this card real-time.  I have been happy with all of my SanDisk purchases.
4.0,So far the tablet has been great! I'm using it for online textbooks and homework! It has treated me well thus far!
4.0,"I recommend anybody to get the 64gb Scandisk Ultra from Amazon, if you are looking to expand your tablet or any device memory. This product was delivered on-time with simple to open packaging. Inserted into my Windows 8 tablet and was able to save, edit, and so on with no problem."
1.0,"Looks nice but that's about it.  Felt cheap, hollow, and clunky.  update:   i like the size, shape, and buttons, but it still feels cheap and hollow it looses bluetooth sync often in windows 10"
5.0,Works
3.0,ok
5.0,I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy phone. I have mounted the card and my apps are using it but I can't seem to get my photos to store there. It works just fine and gives me the added storage capacity I want I now need to figure out how to use it. This brand is really the only brand I would consider buying.
2.0,battery life is too short!
1.0,Slow and poor quality.
2.0,very difficult to put on.  This is the second iCarez product I've gotten and still have the same difficulty. I can't explain exactly but putting it on the ipad was difficult.
4.0,"I really like the case, but I wish I didn't have to pop it out of the bottom two clips in order to use the stand features for the case."
1.0,Bad quality. It had scratches and scuff marks on it. I do not recommend this.
3.0,The quality of the bag is really good but it has less space to keep things.

1.0,"Horrible, was not the right configuration for my laptop model HP G62"
2.0,I purchased this warranty for a webcam. when I thought ut was broken they told me to reach out to the manufacturer because it was still under the manufacturer warranty. I would have been nice if they would have assisted more. I called the manufacturer and they are open very odd hours and no one every answers the phone.
1.0,"I get randomly error messages with my nokia808, ""disk error-"" and the card stops working, its so, so sad.. I bought a cheap 8gb micro sd class 4 that works better than this :("
3.0,"This hub is half-useful. It seems that if there are 4 USBs hooked up, two of them don't work. So really I am just using it for two extra ports."
4.0,I love it so far except 4 stars due to my adaptive lighting does not seem to be working?? I have set it up to use this feature.<br />HELP suggestions appreciated!
1.0,"Seemed to fit in my laptop OK, but it doesn't work right. I leave it plugged in all night with the computer turned off, turn it on in the morning, LEAVE the laptop plugged in, and it still dies after about an hour of use. Thought it might be my chord, so I switched that out as well but it made no difference. Would return to seller and see if the second one they sent me works if I knew how????"
2.0,"After a full charge, I only get about 45-50 minutes of use before battery has to be charged again!"
1.0,"The short version: As network administration major that had two of these cards to try, I can say without a doubt that this product does not perform as advertised. It does not maintain a speed that is reasonable in an environment where other devices perform just fine. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  The long version: I am majoring in Network Administration and Computer Information systems at college, so I have a few basic ideas of how to get a network up and running. I bought two of these cards for two separate computers. They work, but they are dirt slow and cannot maintain a consistent speed. I have a 50Mbps connection coming over a N900 Linkysys router that is only about 20 feet away through one wall. The fastest I can get this card to is 20Mbps at most. Usually it will drop down to 4Mbps.  I have updated the drivers, and rolled them back. I have moved my router closer. I have tried 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and dual-band. I have swapped cards out. I have adjusted antennas in every direction. I have tried no antennas. I have swapped antennas out. I even tried different PCI slots. I have tried more than any reasonable person would to get this product to perform as advertised.  This card advertised 450Mbps, but I only get 4Mbps of my 50Mbps connection. Meanwhile my generic network card,  with no antennas, in my 5 year old laptop pulls 60Mbps in the same location over the same connection. My USB dongle gets a faster connection speed, and I can at least maintain 15Mbps with it. For the record, I had two of these cards to work with so I tried both, and it is the same story with each. I also have a dozen other WiFi devices to prove without a doubt that it is not my router. This product does not perform as advertised. I do not know how it has such high reviews.  Another problem was this cards are the brackets. They were of low quality which made it hard to seat the card properly in the PCIe slot. All in all this card is garbage. Buy a USB adapter if you want a cheap network adapter. Your just wasting your money if you buy this thing. It can't pull full speeds through one wall at 20 feet, so it is worthless.  Update: Installed an ASUS PCE-AC56 card in place of the TP-Link adapter. The ASUS card was about $20 more, but I plugged it in and was pulling 60Mbps down instantly. I didn't even need to install drivers on Windows 10 to get the ASUS adapter to work."
3.0,Build quality issues.  Blue tabs in plug are are more centered than they should be and one broke when I plugged a cable in.
4.0,It works fine in my Verizon Galaxy S3 but has to be formated to FAT32.  Also works in my Canon IXUS 80.
2.0,"The sound of these speakers are okay, but they are so horribly balanced that the slightest knock sends them toppling. One of the bases of the speakers gave in and broke on me just recently and now I already have to find a replacement, even though I've only had these for a few months. Disappointing."
1.0,Way over prices. I would just go with one of the older versions of kindle. It is not worth $400.
1.0,"After purchasing this motherboard and having a few different BIOS issues (even after updating to the latest BIOS), I contacted support, who quickly tried finding any and every possible way to weasle out of saying it is their motherboards fault. I even had multiple different asrock rep's tell me contradictory information about what the issue was and why they would not fix it.  At one point they even told me it was AMD's fault, and they didn't support it... After this the support reps wouldn't even email me back, I haven't been able to get in touch with them since. I would recommend a friend never buy asrock products again, I won't."
5.0,"is everything I need, the best and faster microSD in market, exxecent choice I ordered 2, so I recomended It"
5.0,"Sandisk has made great memory products for a very long time. This is no exception. I bought this to expand the memory of a tablet I bought for my fianc&eacute;e, and it works well. I made sure to buy Class 10 because i want the fastest interaction between the device and the storage. Nothing ruins a user experience like waiting for storage to access and being read from, or written to."
4.0,"Bought it for Lenovo Yoga 3. So far so good: it fits well, the charging is in progress."
2.0,"Needed a new drive and saw this one at a fair price but not even 3 months did this drive survive, you have warranty and what not but I mean, I needed this to work not fail.<br /><br />Packaging was fair for a bare hard drive."
5.0,Works exactly as described and provides more desk space.
5.0,"It's cheap, it's small, and it moves air like a mofo. As long as you don't need to move it around a lot, it's perfect. The light is fairly bright, which might bother some if it's next to your bed, but we use it as a nightlight in our frontroom."
5.0,"Great router for the price, does everything I want it to do and more."
3.0,"Nice basic tablet,easy to use and guick 3g ,but didn't realize it only had a1megapixel camera,wish it was more,but for basic use games internet,its pretty guick thanks!"
4.0,Very good works very good
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:9825228de150770927a29236d46c36bf]] I just received the monitor today. Was very excited to get it setup only to be disappointed. I know things happen and they are sending me a replacement. Hopefully it works, other than the distortion it was easy to setup and easy to use. Has 1 HDMI, 1 VGA and 1 headphone hookup."
3.0,ok  it works.....gets hot
1.0,Didn't fit well at all. The screen protector part was wavy and not smooth. Fell apart after very light use
4.0,"I have a macbook pro 15&#34; retina and it fits perfectly in here, even with a little room to spare, so if you have a case on your laptop, it will fit in there. the inside is a nice velvety fleece. I wish the pocket on the outside were a little bigger so I could fit my charger extension cord in along with my charger, but its still a good case."
1.0,Didn't worked
5.0,I bought it for my galaxy tab 10.1 and formatted it to FAT32.  Works excellent and i have more than enough space for what ever i need on my tablet.  going to buy another one for my Handy cam!
5.0,Easy to use.
2.0,"Do not buy this keyboard...it is advertised with a trackpoint, but it has a rubbish optical trackpoint, which doesn't come close to being the real thing. It isn't nearly as accurate and it is more like a very tiny touchpad than a real trackpoint. The only plus is that it fits my tablet.. the keys are nice, but the main reason i bought this was the trackpoint."
4.0,"Speakers be bumpin, yo. Make sure that sub is clear of debris, and take good care of your equipment."
1.0,"Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn't really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess."
2.0,"Sound coming out of this new design is unacceptably LOUD, probably because of the very thin walled hard plastic case and the loud little fan needed to cool this puppy. I had to relegate this thing to the server room – it was that loud that you really can't have this on your desk.<br />The plastic edges on this are sharp enough to cut or scrape. Disappointing, Seagate."
4.0,"I've ordered two of this monitor. Both of the monitors work perfectly.<br /><br />the only thing I dont like is that the bezel is half an inch into the screen, as well as the frame of the whole monitor. AOC does this a lot though, so its expected."
5.0,"Massive memory boost to my Captivate Glide.Holds all my music, files, etc and i still have 20GB free! O_OTransfer speeds are great!Really worth the price!"
4.0,"Will not fit on the larger HTC one, but the smaller  HTC one it works just fine,my husband  did not like it . Our son loves it."
2.0,"I just reviewed this computer a few days ago. I said it was working well. As it turns out, the computer has no cmos back up if the computer is unpluged. The internal battery does not work or there is a motherboard problem. If the power goes out, date and time must to be reset. If not, I can't get back on line."
2.0,"Bought this and Google Play services is broke.  Google Play Store, Calendar, Hangouts does not work.  Oddly, other Google apps like Gmail, Google Drive work but you can't update apps without Google Play Store.  System Updates stuck at &#60;insert date here&#62;, 1969.  Performed factory resets, re-adding accounts, clearing cache, etc.  Nothing worked.  Probably a bad tablet and will end up returning it.  Assuming it worked, it might still be worth the price paid as long as you can get a working unit."
4.0,"Great for wi fi, the antennae arent significantly obtrusive"
3.0,Shortly after purchase and giving these headphones a good review the 3.5 jack broke inside the computer. I had some complaints about microphone volume being low dispite internal volume being maxed.
4.0,"Its probably better than I think it is. I got this to go in a Samsung tablet which is about to get replaced with an iPad. But the SD memory card portion has not given me any fits yet. The write speed isn't as high as some SD cards and this funky form factor requires an adapter most of the time, so don't expect to pop this into your DSLR."
2.0,"it did not meet my expectation , when i use the multi voltage port the power bank become really hot then went out of battery quickly"
2.0,The bottom part fits perfectly but the top part won't stay.
4.0,"This router works amazingly! I just wish it was a little sturdier and had some more weight to it. I had to tape it down. It is a great way to save $10 a month on rental fees from Comcast! Plus, this modem blows their modem out of the water!"
4.0,Work with my MBP15&#34; 2009-2011.
3.0,can't fit the keyboard very well
5.0,Works great - I purchased two; one for my new cell phone and one for my new tablet.
5.0,We need lots of room in the memory card.  I think there is plenty in this card and San Disk always hss a great product.
1.0,"Avoid this device for now - it's not a finished product.  Tried to install and the Lima was not detected on the main local network. After switching to a different network entirely, the device was detected and made a system update.  Support site is a circular process of moving between two pages that repeat the same information (turn it off and on again, check if you have internet). Rinse and repeat. I did get real human support at one point, but they only repeated the information already shown on the website.  There's no status light on the device so it's hard to tell if it's alive and working properly which is a very poor design decision. You'd think that a light that came on to show power or readiness would be straightforward to include on a device costing $150.  After running for 20 minutes the Lima is quite warm, perhaps even a little hot. I don't know how well it will last with continuous use as a passively cooled device, though after leaving on for a day it did not get any hotter.  Of note is that during the installation process, you are given the chance to add mobile devices, but if you skip this, there is no obvious way to add them later from within the Lima software. You need to go to their website to find the address in order to download the app onto your phone, plus you need to install some third party crash reporting application in order to use the beta app. Also pay attention to the default settings on the phone app - on Android they default to using Wifi + Data to synchronize everything, so if you are on a limited data plan and don't check the settings fully, you could find yourself going over your monthly limit.  If you don't have administrator access to your router, there are two possibilities:  1. Your Lima won't be connected - see the problem I encountered above.  2. You won't be able to set up any port forwarding for the Lima. This means your data will pass through their servers encrypted; as there is no security audit yet on what they do, I guessyou have to take their word for what's going on for encryption. I also don't know what this would mean long term if they decided to turn their servers off or they change business models - maybe you'd need a subscription to keep going when they realize that they need to keep selling devices to keep the servers on. The whole thing is not so clearly explained, and it feels less like you own the device, rather that you have it on loan while they exist.  On the local network transfer speeds look decent, though not fantastic; the real test will be from a remote location.  ***Update*** Depending on what your remote location is, you may not have access to the Lima. I tried in a corporate managed network environment and could not access my Lima; enable tethering on my phone and connect to the tethered network and the Lima pops up. Depending on how you plan to use your Lima, you may not be able to connect to it from all locations - keep this in mind before you buy it as you may not be able to access from a remote location.  For $150 it's not worth it - keep in mind you need to bring your own storage to the table in order to use the Lima, and once the drive is in use on the Lima, you can't unplug it and move the storage to another location and access the same files.  If they continue to add features and capabilities in the future, then it could reach the promised potential, but at the moment you are buying a promise of future functionality rather than a fully realized product that's ready to go."
5.0,Fantastic case with plenty of room for cable management and a large motherboard.  Fans run quietly and the CAM program which monitors the CPU & GPU is a nice touch.  Would definitely recommend.
1.0,"Don't bother buying these, they will just fall off again a few weeks after you install them."
3.0,This modem can't be used for phone service. I wasn't aware of this until I got it.  Probably lack of research on my part.
4.0,"Excellent,  4 stars because not come with the CD, I hope lasts"
2.0,"These seem to be good power jacks, but they did not come with mounting nuts. Only way I see to use them is to drill a hole in a plastic case & screw them into it. Not sure I'll be able to find metric nuts to fit. The picture shows them coming with nuts."
3.0,"With in 30 days, now it turns the screen to black background (on all application) automatically with in 10 from restart. Then i have to go to settings, display, change the option from &#34;standard&#34; to 180 degree view and then revert back to &#34;standard&#34; to get white background."
4.0,Great skin but I wish it had instructions.
3.0,great buy
3.0,"This card is on the short list of cards rated for the GoPro series camera. I found it too slow compared to the new ones out there right now (Aug 2015) which are up to 80GPS from the 45GPS. It worked OK, but you do notice the speed is so much slower which I thought was rather important since you are dealing with 64 GB. 50% fast means several minutes."
1.0,"Speakers arrived with one of them deeply scuffed, directly in the front where it shows. The connecting cable was not included so I went out and purchased one which was pointless because the second speaker was a dud anyway. The water only dances when the sound is turned up so loud that it distorts. I like the shape of them but no good if they don't function."
3.0,"Using as a little boys briefcase for church.  one of the snaps broke the day we got it, but he still uses it and I can force it closed.  The combination doesn't work, as in you can have it on any old number and it will open, but that's probably for the best when little boys are using it.  My son is 2 1/2 and loves to have a briefcase like Daddy.  Its small and light, although add a bible, song book, coloring book, a couple small toys and it gets a little heavy for him.  Great buy for a kid."
3.0,Takes adequate photos for photo ID on my patient's medical charts. Difficult to attach to an iMac so we hand hold it. It needs a more universal bracket. Wide angle lens makes the nose appear larger. Big problem now is it does not operate when I upgraded my medical soft ware recently & will check with the software support. It's cheap enough that I could replace but will need to know if a new one will work.
4.0,No complaints as yet.....It came with an adapter as advertised. I wished that I had purchased two instead of one.
2.0,well the price was right
5.0,"Does the job, works perfectly."
1.0,One of the RAMs  was defective. My computer started giving me issues shortly after a week. I went to apple store for a checkup where they told me that your RAM was defective.
2.0,"Ok, so about a month ago I bought this product. When it came to my house I put it in my xbox. The main reason that I bought it was for the motor to open the disk tray since my other one was broken. When the motor worked I expected everything to go well. But of course it didn't. This disk drive won't read my games at all. I checked all the chords but still, it doesn't work."
4.0,"This bag fits my Surface Pro 3 perfectly. I purchased this bag before a business trip and it stood the test. I even had room to carry a USB mouse, Bluetooth stylus, a charging cable and 2 HDMI adapters. This bag does not have room for full letter-sized papers or pads of paper, but a small notebook could fit in the extra pocket. My only complaint is that the carrying straps and handles don't quite match the fabric of the bag, but it is not too terribly off (I bought the grey bag)."
4.0,"Fits well, seems to work okay, battery life hasn't changed much-still about 3 to 4 hours with my model Toshiba."
3.0,"Works good its as long as it says but ,it is however very low end on the built."
4.0,this product has worked well with my go pro 3 black edition not slow or glitchy love the products and do reccomend
2.0,"Great idea, but extremely poor execution. I have two of these pens. Both are not working properly; one is completely dead, and the other has a bad display. I would not recommend these pens unless they are brand new, and you don't mind dealing with bad hardware, poorly written software, and below average customer support. I think they can do better. Livescribe, it would be nice if you offered extended support for your products.<br /><br />Notice my pen below. It is fully charged and on...the display is black---this is the 2GB Pulse Pen. It has actually had very little use, and still looks brand new."
2.0,"I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but the device seems pretty slow. I haven't seen any real performance boost vs. my old card even on bulk file copies. I have another 8GB samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this card.I'm using it anyway. I don't really have the time to return it or anything."
3.0,so so
3.0,Had it for about four months and it was great at first. I take good care of my laptop and I'm not rough with it but the corners of the bottom chipped off making the bottom plate unusable. It happened after about 3-4 months of gentle use. Top plate has held up fine and is in good condition.
5.0,So far so good. Fit right into the slot on my Samsung S5
1.0,The power button broke off easy!
5.0,"Awesome lightweight small 1TB device from SAMSUNG with Super high speed interface, but you must use a USB 3.0 cable, or the one that comes with it to get full speed.  Check any other USB cable that claims to have all the wires in it - many do not and they reduce speed by more than a factor of 10."
1.0,Bad product.  Had to return as hard disk failed.
4.0,Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter which i believe will let you use it on your Wii or 3DS.
3.0,"This product works as described.  It's just not super quick.  I would recommend this product, especially, if you get it on sale."
1.0,This mouse has hardware problems that make it difficult to use for gaming.
2.0,Bought several. Half quit working within 2 months.
1.0,"Feels cheap.  Very light, Would have been better if built into the laptop, or, at least, provide longer cords."
2.0,Las esquinas golpeadas
3.0,Did not fit fit my iPad 2 as it said it would
4.0,Great replacement battery for my HP Envy dv6 7323cl laptop at a fraction of the price of a new battery from HP!  Longer battery life than the original battery! Update: battery lasted for 8 months.  I am now in need of a new one.
4.0,"I was surprised by this monitor. I was really not expecting something so good. It is sturdy, the resolution is amazing and it seems to work just great."
4.0,so glad this was all I needed to bring my computer back to life! :)
3.0,"It is a good price but it does not fit perfectly, smooth. Also when I have shorts and use the laptop in my lap and I open the computer the case pinch my skin and is SUPER painful...."
2.0,"I purchased this case hoping that it would be as the previous reviewers described it. However, it does not securely fit my 15 inch MacBook Pro. It is loose on one side and that is very frustrating. The keyboard cover is not lined up properly. The letters and numbers are not even in the middle of the squares. I will be returning this case and I will not recommend this product in the future."
2.0,"After just a couple of months of having this backpack, the top handle and zipper tore.  When I tried to contact Belkin for an exchange, the experience was long and weirdly confusing and ultimately, I did not get an exchange.  Sorely disappointing because the slim design is nice and I would have liked this to last longer than it did."
1.0,"The adapter didn't work at all.  It would heat up when plugged in, so juice was running through it, but the device manager didn't recognize it on either of the two computers I used."
1.0,Junk!!! The picture showed a cable but the ones I received were just the plugs..<br />Couldn't get them to work and one of the plugs came off into my phone.. This isn't an apple product. Lies!!
4.0,Well worth the price.
3.0,"My wrist still hurts , but not as bad as the naked table."
4.0,Great but a little problem to fit
2.0,It have a problems about not recognized by SSE 3 engine its is a great mice but if you cant to use fully function its useless Gaming mouse.
2.0,The white beads inside the cushion portion started spilling out along a seam.  I had to superglue an edge to keep it from losing all its filling.
5.0,Perfect
3.0,"Simple to use.  I like that it comes with additional foam pads.  This is not the best product for use with the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 - 4th generation because it partially blocks the rear facing camera.  The FDX is also thinner then previous Kindles so the extra foam pads helped to anchor the tablet into the Ipow adapter.  With that said, as a Kindle Fire HDX 7 and 8.9 user/owner I would purchase this product again."
2.0,"I bought this Tablet for Christmas gift to my daughther, The device worked OK initially, however it seems to have problems with the OS of the device, the Tablet emit sounds however the display is  always black, so from december 25 Th I cannot use the tablet. It would be useful to communicate with people of Toshiba in order to sove this situation"
5.0,"People often ask me about bargain-basement pricing on no-name brands of media, and you know I just have to cite my own experiences with cheap media, and it's just that, cheap media, prone to failure or worse if it's a complex format as this one is, the SDXC format. They have crammed a TON of memory modules in that little bujgger, you know? I say go with experience, go with a leader in the field, so there's pretty much SanDisk at the top of the heap, and the rest trail far, far behind in volume and precision assembly techniques...so I vote for SanDisk every time, and unless my experience is changed  by some anomaly I'll keep on recommending SanDisk above all others.It's rated at 40MB/sec write speed, which is enough to keep up with even the fastest real camera or phone camera out there in the wild, and it certainly keeps up with my Samsung Note 3's 13-mega-pixel rocket camera, one that shoots up to 8fps in burst mode taking certain shots, so if it works for that camera perfect, chances are it will work for your setup great also!Buying the SanDisk memory module costs what, $5-$7 more than the others max, right? I say buy this one here, it's a winner in all respects.Wavey Davey 1-12-2014"
1.0,"I wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky. Well it sucks being one of them. I cannot get this card to format not matter what device, software or technique I use. The mistake I made was that I didn't use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I'm out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don't know if it's quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it's write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway?  Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone."
3.0,It's to easy to get what you don't want on the screen. I liked the old one better with the controls on the side.
5.0,"Lots of room, enough speed and everything that I need portable is going along for the ride. No loss of data for me."
2.0,It not for a MarAir
5.0,love these. I now own two.
5.0,This product is the only one I had bought like this that has worked will recommend to all family and friends
4.0,Not fast but so useful... and discrete.
1.0,"Defective product, would not power on. ARRIS support was no help, only told me to return product to Amazon. Looks like I missed out on a great price, as the current price is now $25 more than I paid."
1.0,"Major issues, bought FROM san disk but only worked briefly, now when I try to reformat it reports itself as a 30 meg removeable drive in both windows and macos--not sure if its defective or a mislabeled one--but got direct from amazon so just very disapointed. Will stick with transcend from now on I think."
5.0,Its so small you forget you already inserted it.
5.0,"Everything worked and the imperfections (scratches) were negligible. I ordered two units. One came with a dual VGA connector and the other unit came with a dual DVI connector. Try to request the one you want so you don't have to scrounge around for the right one. N.B., the DVI connector is not marketed anymore; I had to buy it on Ebay."
2.0,I was very disappointed because the number board stopped working after a couple of weeks and the space bar  doe not work the first time you hit it so I have a lot of errors that I have to go back and fix
5.0,Great for my small lipstick chargers for my iPhone to keep in my pocketbook
2.0,"It had a textured top, something that wouldn't work for me in this instance."
2.0,The battery life is the worst.  It doesn't last more then a couple hours if that.  Not impressed by it.  I regret purchasing it.
4.0,if you like the Thermaltake brand (as i do) and you want the best head set out there this is the one to get. i think 100 bucks is alittle much / over priced but i wanted it soo...<br /><br />the software is easy enough to use but there are no videos on youtube or guides online to tell you how to set it up and i kinda wish there was because im not sure if im getting the most out of it (i have no idea how to set up sound stuff)... because honestly i cant even tell its surround sound.<br /><br />it looks sexy as hell though which is the real reason i bought it.
2.0,Bought one of these to fix My Granddaughters tablet. The glass is bonded to a plastic frame that You will need to repair Your broken glass. It cannot be taken apart to put the new glass in. Cant be repaired without the plastic frame.
3.0,"Lasted me a year. Up until about a month ago it worked terrifically for me and I had no complaints. Cheap and simple. It met my simple needs for Dota, CS:GO, and other less intensive games. Now the wire is beginning to fail and if the usb or the wire near the usb gets even gently moved it has trouble reconnecting to my computer. Not great but it's okay. Still works, but I'm replacing it because it can be a pain."
1.0,"randomly erases all my data and asks me to format card on my unmodified unrooted sprint Galaxy SIII ,i dont know how scandisk is selling these,i trusted the brand and it didnt work"
2.0,"This tablet is a very good one but for one thing, it does not have Google Play as advertised."
2.0,Heatsink too small for todays northbridges this may fit a south bridge then your graphics card won't seat. Also the rpms on the fan suck barely moves air....
1.0,"The light does not work with my Kindle, which was very disappointing as that was the whole reason I bought it!"
1.0,Appeared to be too large in that I could not get the entire length to adhere to the screen of my iPhone 6 plus.  About a third of one end of the screen looked to have one large air bubble.  I checked to insure that it was properly aligned at both ends which it was.  Using a credit card to slowly force out the large air bubble only accomplished the cracking of the glass in one corner.  It was advertised as being just a little bit smaller than the iPhone screen but results don't support that.
2.0,"very cheaply put together. not made well, very flimsy no room for anything extra in here"
3.0,They need one of these for 12-13 inch laptops as to not have too much width and to have a smaller lip. The lip should also have some kind of padding. The legs on my product were not even either as if it was warped. Otherwise it's perfect.
2.0,There was absolutely no paperwork that came with the product. That was very disappointing.
4.0,"We actually have several of these cases made by different manufacturers.  This one is designed like the others and the construction is comparable but, for $11 and change, the price is better.  There is not a lot of storage provided for the game cartridges if you prefer to store them separate from one another (not just tossed all together in a zipper compartment) so we purchase these:[[ASIN:B004K6LQAS Nintendo 3DS Game Card Case 24 - Black]] to use with the bag."
1.0,This item died 3 months after purchase...not happy at all
3.0,"I love it! !!  BUT the pad fits too small on the case and the back looks like it was created for sn ipad. Other than that, I love it!"
5.0,"It's 64GB and it's in my phone.  Really, that's all you need for a review.  What more could you want?  I have all my music, several movies and I can record stuff on camera at full HD without worrying about running out of space.  No issues at all.  Did I mention it's 64GB?"
2.0,"I've had the Wrath for a few years.  While the sound and comfort is excellent, they recently broke as the cheap piece of plastic at the base of the band, secured by two small screws, pulled through.  It is a minor problem right?  There are screws for removing and replacing parts giving the appearance that the unit is readily repairable.  However - Creative sells NO parts.  Check it out for yourself.  They offer no repair parts for their products.  If it breaks and it is out of the short warranty, then buy something new.  This is their tech support suggestion.  I will forever more steer clear of any Creative product."
3.0,ok
3.0,"Dear Kindle:<br /><br />I'm disappointed this version (and probably all newer ones) is a commercial to buy things as much as anything else. Where are the lovely drawings and etchings that one finds when kindle is in sleep mode or just awakens? While this version is a little more convenient to use-- I'm sad you don't have the courage to stay with simple and sublime. All the reader needs and not more is not a place to shop, nor overly complicated &#34;convenience&#34; as though it is a computer (we have enough of those). But instead a simple motif for those who like to read--some beautiful imagery in black and white and one's chosen  library.  &#62;sigh&#60;  Won't be buying much…I can guarantee you that."
3.0,good
4.0,Bought this for my girlfriend.The card works very nice and is a great way to up your storage on your cell phone.this is currently in a Samsung Galaxy S4.
1.0,Lags and makes everything slow
4.0,My son loves it but it eats batteries. Probably have to change twice a month. But it does get heavy use. And you can turn the lights off on it to save battery.
2.0,Can't use the camera when the IPad is in the case.
4.0,"I don't know what or why Other people are having them break and malfunction. Mine works great, charges quickly, and is pretty durable. My only issue is that it fits my tablet a little snugly. So it takes more force to eject it. But otherwise no problem."
3.0,This case wears out quickly and slides off my Surface RT when opening.
5.0,"It is amazing how well this little device works. My modem is in a room which is almost like a &#34;semi-basement&#34; so,the wifi signal reaches only the most adjacent rooms. With this Netgear device, I have a very good signal in the rest of the house.<br /><br />Setting it up was not an easy task, but I got very good support from Net Gear's tech. people.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, great value for the price"
1.0,Did not hold charge for long as days passed. Speakers not loud enough. Do not buy.
1.0,I haven't even been using this product for two months before it stopped working. This is a piece of crap and a waste of money. No I did not drop it or damage it. It just stopped working. I'm extremely disappointed.
1.0,the case i got was broken in the corner
3.0,I get the occasional dropped frames when using it to record HD video in HD camera. Solid for the 1 couple of weeks. Time will tell.
4.0,"Perfect for what it is, and the price. Performs better than I expected."
1.0,This product sucks the drivers on the cd won't even install. I just keep getting an error telling me path can not be found.
3.0,"does not fit well into usb port, just a bit too short"
3.0,This product was suggested with the LaCie external hard drive i purchased. Case was slightly too small to it does not zip all the way. Quality product just be careful with product dimensions.
3.0,The extender not solve my problem on 2nd floor
1.0,Product worked for a few days then failed had to retirn it...
3.0,After about a year the outer rubber cover became soft and began tearing. Also the stand is flimsy. It broke easily. However it's hard to find a reasonably priced better case.
4.0,"It does what its suppose to do.  I use it in my Samsung laptop, I never remove it so its never a problem."
5.0,very good
2.0,Does not seem to lie flat. Always curls up on edges.
3.0,I'm not a fan of the matte after trying it. Really degrades the screen resolution.
5.0,"The moment I got this, I just plugged it into my SGS3 cellphone. I transferred some videos from my cellphone memory directly to the SanDisk Ultra, and it copied real fast. I plan to replace this soon with a higher capacity 32GB variant. Highly recommended brand."
5.0,"This was purchased as a gift and so far the individual is very pleased. I've helped them get it setup and they are enjoying it. So far, the speed works great and it is the perfect size needed."
2.0,"Don't waste your money buying a kindle fire hd 7&#34;. You'll do 100 better buying any other tablet on the market. The Kindle is limited by Amazon and purposely doesn't allow downloads of apps that aren't on Amazon market place.  This tablet has soooo many problems !! AS in :  slow connection to internet, NO connection to internet possible much of the time, slow or no connection to videos, games, etc. NO support!!! Just reading other problems from other owners.  So, do yourself a huge favor and buy ANYTHING ELSE!!!  Mine was a gift from my well-meaning son."
3.0,Worked but cabling is difficult to route.
3.0,I'm so sorry that my review doesn't meet your expectation. I'm having personal problems right now and can not try this product out. My laptop was stolen..... I don't have INTERNET set up. I don't have a home computer right now . That's in storage. I'm sure it's good. I have not bought anything that was in poor condition as of today.
3.0,"Quick review: One broke within the first week of being used, the other two work good. ;("
5.0,I didn't really need this for my phone but I figured I may as well get it. Got to love 32gb of storage. Works good for when recording 1080P video.
2.0,"Lately everything freezes up and we have to unplug it from the computer and power, wait a few minutes and then reconnected to get anything to recognized. Including our wireless keyboard and mouse.<br />Doesn't work with our Nexus 6 for syncing. I know it says it wont charge tablets and this is a big phone. But syncing to get full resolution photos off is a must!"
5.0,Love it - can't put it down - so user-friendly
4.0,Speed squeaks in at a bare minimum of a class 10. Good for tablets and smartphones wouldn't recommend it for Picture or Video Camera's
5.0,"Seemed to work well at first.  Then, I noticed the phone started mounting/unmounting the card. When I tried to update some music files on the card, I think it has failed.  My computer can no longer see it in the phone when the two are connected.Okay - an update here. Since I posted the problem on Amazon I was contacted by Sandisk. I made one phone call, they took my information, e-mailed me a pre-paid UPS label, and I sent the card in. I couldn't believe it, but I think I had a new and improved card in about three days!  Yes, the first one lasted a little over twelve months, but the replacement was tendered no questions asked. Great service that can only be five stars.By the way, the replacement is working great!  I ordered a 64gb Sandisk microSDHC Card as well!"
1.0,Slowwwwww
1.0,"I put this in my Galaxy Note II and put a bunch of music and PDFs on it.  I also used it to save videos and photos.  It worked well for about 2 months then, on Christmas Day (today), it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank.  My phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the SDHC reader of my laptop doesn't work.If this is SanDisk Quality, then I am not impressed.  I am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but I'd rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after 2 months..."
1.0,WASTE OF MONEY THE END CAME  OFF 3 OF THEM IN 1 WEEK
5.0,Lives up the billing of very fast data transfer speeds.  I love that I can just plug my Note 2 into my PC and drop stuff onto this thing to my hearts content.  Access speeds are very good and I've had no issues using it.
4.0,Very nice little tablet for my 6 year old grandchild to play games on.
3.0,"Very nice headset, fully worth the price, right up until the point where the left side stopped working. Seems like a broken wire in the cord, as the sound comes back briefly if I jiggle it. 3 years old, so out of warranty. A shame. :( Would have been 4 (it IS pricey) or 5 (it IS a great headset) otherwise."
1.0,"I thought I was getting a really good deal when I've bought 128GB version for $30 - WRONG. The only things that's good about this drive is it's size.<br />When writing any file over ~2GB it gets extremely hot (&#62;120F) and write speed drops to below 3MB/sec (not, it's not a typo!) using either USB2 or USB3 ports. Compare that real-life sequential write speed to &#34;up to 40MB/sec&#34; claimed by SanDisk.<br />Spend some more but don't buy this piece of electronic junk. If I can return it I certaily will."
2.0,"It was good at first, but then the little metal tabs fell out of one side of the case and now the magnetic<br />clasp does not keep the case closed"
2.0,Cheap flimsy crap. It works but who knows for how long.
1.0,Was dead on arrival and would not charge
3.0,Love the case till one of the bands broke after 7 months of gently use.
1.0,Poor
5.0,Great price on this product.  Half of what Samsung was charging for the same memory card. Works just fine in my Notewith no pproblems what so ever.
2.0,Decent looking and fitting.  The case basically provides no drop protection.  Several keys stopped functioning after a few months. So this is essentially a temporary throw away product.  Although I had the same experience with the Zagg it replaced
2.0,"If you have a gopro, get a different card, it worked in mine for a while then stopped, turns out the gopro fried it, no fault of gopro but through sandisks error, sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again. I've read up on it and it's a common issue, so if you use this for a gopro, get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side."
3.0,"Right now I am only give it 3 stars because I have not really used it a lot and I am not very tech oriented.  So it will take me a while to give you a honest report on the Kindle Voyage.  I will say I do love the case I bought for the Kindle it is a Vintage case made of PU Leather.  I have no idea<br />what PU Leather is but it is very well made and holds and protects the Kindle quite well.  I will say I am not happy with the color purple I choose as it is darker than the picture.  I would have choose the turquoise one if I had known that the purple was that dark.  On the computer it looked like a nice<br />royal purple but upon receiving it, it turned out to be a dark purple.  But hey for $12.95 I cant complain and it is too much trouble to send back for just<br />the color."
1.0,"Rip off, do not buy this!"
1.0,"My mother bought this and it started having problems 8 months after she bought it, well it quit working 8 days after the 1 year mark and they REFUSE to replace it (told us she has to pay for a replacement).  They said that they don't even fix their products...Why would you sell a product that you cannot repair.  Mom is on a fixed income and cannot afford to buy another one.  I have 4 different Kindle products at this moment and now will be getting rid of ALL of them and going to the Ipads (at least they fix their products)"
3.0,"The camera part of this product works great,  The microphone is inadequate.  At a distance of less than 18 inches it can barely pick up my voice and I speak loudly as it is."
4.0,Works as advertised
4.0,"Great product - lap side is comfortable and soft without having it sink into your legs (and therefor making you hot), both fans work well and don't seem to use a lot of laptops power.  Worth the money"
3.0,i returned item
4.0,Not crazy about silk. Would prefer another browser. Also can't link my Google account.
2.0,The fit is not great.  There are already bubbles over the space bar and both shift keys.  This is my second Kuzy and the first one was perfect.  I wore a hole in the &#34;e&#34; key over about four years.  Sorry they changed the product.
2.0,"It was a little smaller than i thought. Buttons didnt seem t be in the right place. I especially didnt like the the homescreen, i couldn't arrange it the way i wanted it."
5.0,Unbelievable room in a tiny package.  So far have been able to store and retrieve hi-def video with no problems.
4.0,A+
4.0,Doing the job so far what more can you ask.
3.0,It's a nice tablet but the battery went bad rtight after 30 days that I had to send in to ASUS service center for repair.
2.0,"I built a computer in 2013 with this as the power supply. When first starting the computer, it worked perfectly. Started to install Windows 7, and it needed to restart. Upon trying to restart it, I discover the computer will not boot without resetting the CMOS. So for the next two years, every time I needed to restart, I had to reset the CMOS. I assumed it was the motherboard's problem.<br /><br />More recently, I started getting odd crashes. No blue screen, instead every external device shuts down but the computer it'self is still on, which is a common issue with power supplies at a lower wattage than what the system needs. This is a 600W power supply that can't provide enough power for a 450W system? Plus it had been fine two years. The issue with my motherboard was most likely caused by it as well, and the motherboard is now permanently damaged.<br /><br />It's my top priority to get a better power supply so I don't continue to do more damage to my system, but I already suspect it has messed up my graphics card. I try not to shop by brand, but I've only heard bad things about Apevia PSUs, plus all of the issues I've had. I will not be getting another power supply by Apevia ever. Not only could it damage other parts of your computer but it's probably a fire hazard on top of that."
1.0,"I got this laptop at Walmart a few years ago because I needed a cheap one, fast. You get what you pay for. I think my old dial-up desktop was faster than this!!"
4.0,"It is a good match for the Sansung ATIV.  I don't know that I have used it yet but, it's in there."
5.0,Works great. My phone is happy. I'm happy because I can put more music and pictures on it.  The price was perfect.
5.0,"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this. The amount of storage space is fantastic.There are options for using this on older devices, that don't necessarily support MicroSDXC formats. Windows, by default, will only allow you to format the card as exFat or NTFS. These formats will work for most new devices, but some may have issue.If you use FAT32 as the filesystem instead, you can use this card for older devices, and it still works great with Android. I've been using this card on my old Sandisk Sansa Fuze (running Rockbox) and it works great. I was not expecting that, but I am very happy with it!"
2.0,"Worked great for 5 months. Now it's completely dead at 0% and I have to plug in just to power on. Bought another from a different Amazon seller, installed last night and it lost 11% in sleep mode by morning. I'll buy one more, and then if that fails, my beloved EP121 will be retired. No warranty info comes with the product, and good luck contacting the seller."
5.0,"Works great and faster than a conventional memory card. videos, pictures and access run smoother. highly recomnended for those who are in need of great space."
4.0,Good choice
4.0,Works well so far only had for 1 month.
5.0,"Surprisingly pleased with this wireless mouse.  Works great and have not had any complaints.  I'm kind of clumsy so it has been dropped several times, kicked a few, etc, and is still holding up well.  The batteries that were included from Amazon have actually lasted longer than I expected they would as well.  Would buy again if needed, but its still working great."
5.0,SanDisk is the best brand. This chip does exactly what it should do and does it at very good speed. My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 loves this chip.
2.0,"Sorry folks.  The cables/jackets are inordinately stiff compared to [more expensive] C2G equivalents.<br /><br />If your sanity and reputation depends on anything, AVOID these.  Case closed—end of discussion..."
1.0,The cords are not held tightly and fall out. Spacing is too wide.
5.0,"I bought this to expand my 32GB Dell XPS 10 to 64GB. It fits easily into the Micro SD slot and was recognized by Windows RT upon boot up. I did reformat the card (old habit), and haven't had any problems at all."
4.0,It's pretty good.
4.0,pretty! and very useful
1.0,This was a piece of crap. The edges of it wore off within a month and so my iPad has been sliding out of the case. I would not recommend it at all.
2.0,Tedious to align. Several air bubbles. If you don't get it right the first time subsequent attempts are more difficult.
5.0,"This product is a great value. It looks clean and professional; when closed, it provides outstanding protection, and when open, you can prop it at several angles."
4.0,"I put this in my mom's ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR to provide an ample amount of storage for all pictures, music, and movies. This performs very well and we've experience 0 lag so far. Great product."
1.0,"I have bought this item twice now.  The first one worked great, but then broke after about 2 months.  Specifically, some of the keys stopped working...random letters.  This renders the keyboard totally useless because you just can't type anything when you're missing part of the alphabet.<br /><br />I decided to buy another one, thinking the first one was a fluke.  But, the second broke after almost the exact same amount of time, and in the exact same way!  The keys that stopped working are different, but it's definitely broken again.<br /><br />This product is NOT worth it.  If they sold it for $1, you could justify using it for a few weeks before it breaks, and then buying a new one.  But, the quality of this product is so poor that you're better off finding another brand that builds products to last.<br /><br />BTW - buyer beware - don't just go off the 5-star reviews unless it says &#34;verified purchase&#34;.  It's easy for the company to generate fake reviews of itself that are immaculate.  Everyone who has left 1-star reviews is seeing the same problem with this product.  It breaks down pretty soon after you buy it!"
3.0,"Reliable and inexpensive. However, it's quite slow, far, far slower than the 64GB samsung pro microsdxc. The Samsung works well for interactive use while I would only use this Sandisk card for applications where speed isn't important."
5.0,"Got a really good deal on this humongous capacity card on Black Friday, Thanks Amazon, been waiting for the price to go down.Using this on a Galaxy S3 as FAT 32. I was unable to get this recognized in the phone as an ExFat. Anyone having problems with this in the Galaxy Lineup of phones might want to try the FAT 32 formatting."
4.0,I really like this SD card. It's fast and it looks good. Great value too. What more can be said?
4.0,Charges laptop fine. Wish jack was L shaped or a little longer like the original charger. I notice this one gets unplugged easier.
5.0,"Bought this for my Galaxy S4, works great but doesn't support UHS1.Benchmark test:Phone- 19.4MB/s read, 9.2MB/s writeUSB 2.0- 18MB/s read, 6.3MB/s writeUSB 3.0- 30.2MB/s read, 11.3MB/s write"
5.0,Great
5.0,Rolled the camera on the highest settings and till battery died. Card was fast and no complaints. Bought Two of these for my GoPro.
2.0,"This case does not fit the Razor Deathstalker Ultimate case at all. I was hoping that it would have enough stretch in it to fit the keyboard, but it doesn't come close. I would further warn against using it for any larger full sized keyboard.  Over all build quality is decent, this is definitely not a bargain at $15, but I don't feel like it is over priced either."
4.0,"Pro:  Small, fast, and priced OK.  This is basically a class 10 card; file access is noticeably faster than a class 4 I was using before.Con:  not really noticed anything."
4.0,"For the money, it's really not bad."
2.0,Very cheap and poorly made.  The light does not provide adequate light to read.
2.0,"I really like the keyboard and mouse. However, the battery just died on me and I purchased it only 6 months ago. I thought the description said last for 18 months for mouse and 3 year for keyboard. This is not the case."
5.0,"I use this in my Hero3 white edition camera for FPV.  I've done about 20 videos to date, without a single problem."
2.0,"Was great, for a while.  At first I was getting exceptional battery life.  I have had it for about a year and have hesitated to write up until now because I feel that these type of products need a good length of time before giving an honest review.<br /><br />I bought this for my Late 2008 Macbook and it was great at first.  I use this Mac infrequently but it was good for when I did use it.  Now after only having 39 charge cycles on it, I am lucky to get an hour of charge on this battery.  I would expect such a short time if I was using my Mac for processor heavy things such as video editing or video playback, but this happens after only browsing the web.  I am getting the same battery life as I did with the original battery, which prompted me to order this one.  Perhaps seek another product if you want it to last more than a year, not sure the typical life of these things but considering I have very low charge cycles it seems it went quick."
3.0,"Great basic mouse, although expect a delay when trying to connect to your computer.​"
4.0,"Works well. Lighting on keys is good. I prefer a flat keyboard so it's a bit tough for me to type on, but for gaming it works quite well."
5.0,"My son loves it.  It especially fast now that I have swapped out the original hybrid drive for a Samsung EVO SSD.  It is a shame that they sell these at all with a standard drive.  With the SSD, the computer boots in 5 seconds or less every time."
4.0,delivery was fast and product works
5.0,"I purchased this for a Galaxy Tab 10.1 but didn't like it - I returned the tablet (and accidently left the memory card in it).  So this is the second one I've purchased, it is now in use in an ASUS T1000 tablet/notebook and I am entirely satisfied."
3.0,"I like the product, but maybe I did something wrong when placing it because the last corner didn't stick and now is lifting up little by little. I would probably have to order a new one soon."
3.0,Really hard to remove it once it's on.
4.0,"fit great,and looks good."
4.0,"Review for: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A),This product arrived via USPS, its not in any individual packing from the manufacturer, it was placed in an SD case together with the adapter.  So, I am unable to verify warranties or authenticity. The Samsung S3 recognized and formatted this with no problem.  It sees it as an external memory with 59GB.  The Six GB is probably allocated for FAT/File allocation table.  Will order again from this seller!"
1.0,"Bought it 11 months ago. Konked out. Will not charge. Runs really slow.<br /><br />2017 - Still worst purchase I ever made on amazon.  Runs slowly. Touchscreen never responded well.  I can read books on it, and that's it.  When I tap on a book it takes 3-5 minutes for the book to come up.  My next tablet will be an android tablet and I will just use Kindle Reader.  I cannot in good conscience recommend a Kindle of any generation to anyone else based on the fiasco this turned out to be."
2.0,Ok product. Tore up quickly
3.0,"The cable works fine, for the most part. However, the glue holding the magnet in place wasn't too strong, and the magnet came loose. This gives me pause and I don't entirely trust the cable. However, once I pushed the magnet back in, it's worked pretty consistently."
3.0,It was thin and light but did not make me feel safer with my phone
5.0,Added additional storage on my Surface Tablet.  It allows me the storage of items that I want or need to transport to other devices.
1.0,This product is garbage!!
3.0,"Its probably not the batteries fault but I've been having a flickering power source problem. I bought a battery and a new charger. Charger works great, when I plug it in. Power goes through and hasn't blown up yet. But. When I put in the new battery, it does the same thing my old one did. The charge stops going into the battery and says &#34;charger not plugged in&#34; and my computer goes dim. If it was my charger, without my battery in, my computer would shut on and off, but has lasted 12 hours without a crisis while plugged in without a battery. then i put in the battery my screen turns  dim and the battery is losing power because it isn't plugged in. Maybe its my battery port? theres nothing visably wrong with it, I never tampered with it at all. Maybe i bought and have 2 defective batteries?"
5.0,"Im using this on my HTC Inspire 4G works well, copies extremely fast, and no lag on Video Camera App. Worked right out of the box when installed in my HTC and can now enjoy HD Video instead of pixelated youtube quality. SD Card Adapter works too; no problems. Extremely recommend for such an affordable yet genuine Micro SD Card."
3.0,It is what it is. :) Good enough for protection around the house or quick travel in a bag.
1.0,Terrible experience! I typed in the part number from the original battery. The battery worked for a few weeks and then the computer died. We took the computer to a computer place and they said the mother board was burned because we had installed the wrong battery. :((
5.0,upgraded from a class4  to this can feel the difference on both a S2 and S3. Fast read and write speed really help when downloading large files as well from the internet with speed.
2.0,"I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card."
2.0,"I ordered this card as part of a lighning deal back in November. The card was working fine in my galaxy s3 until a few weeks ago where it would intermittently not be recognized by my phone or my desktop computer and today, 4 months later, it died completely. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
2.0,"Bought this in Feb of this year and its already breaking. Will stop working after about 15 minutes of use, have to unplug and plug it back in to get it to work. I have my old mouse and used it in its place and that old mouse still works no problem. No support on finalmouse website that I can find :-("
1.0,Stopped working on my iPad and iPhone after a week.
5.0,"We ordered two of them, one for me and one for my sun.We use them on our Galaxy 3 phones and have never hada problem.  I never worry about space on my phone now."
1.0,"Nothing wrong with it, just did not like exterior finish - looked too plastic"
1.0,"Please don't be naive like me and believe these bogus reviews. The Same day I received this is the same day it said &#34;not charging&#34; when I tried to use it. I knew better but I'm a college student on a budget and thought I'd give it a try. But this does not work, please save your money and time. The real chargers sold by Apple are expensive but at least they work, spend the extra money. So frustrated and I hate sending things back but there's no use in keeping it if it doesn't work !"
5.0,"Looks like journal on my ipad, was the exact look i was going for."
1.0,missing usb adaptor..box messed up..sent back...
1.0,"Died within 6 months! Stopped being able to read or write :( When I went to destroy it, it crumbled easily into tiny pieces. Never again."
2.0,"Worked great, for about 3 months then it just died, no power to the unit at all. It's unfortunate because besides the build quality I can't fault the device on it's performance."
4.0,Great computer but sometimes the cursor gets stuck like right now.
1.0,broke REAL quick
1.0,This is the worst case ever!! The top part went on fine but the bottom part wouldn't even snap into place properly. Overall it just feels like a cheaply made product at a high price. Returning.
1.0,very difficult to use.  Could not make it work and returned
4.0,"Good quality.  Has a design flaw.  The front support pegs push up into the case, cause the case to fall over (forward)."
4.0,works fine
4.0,Display is large and clear.  Easy to operate.  A bargain.
2.0,"As far as sound and overall build integrity go, these things are fantastic. I love everything about the set. The only gripe I have about them is the cord, which completely failed on me. It developed a moderate bend after only a few months of careful use. I doubt that the braided cords of the higher-end models are as fragile, so when I have enough money to do so, I'll be moving up to the 7.1 Chroma.  Update: The adjuster band broke after I set the headset down. I did nothing out of the ordinary. It just snapped."
3.0,"I bought 5 of these to give to officemates.  They only worked when they were straight and would not when bent to send the air where you wanted it.  After playing around with it, I got a small bend tat the fan worked but, I also had to move the computer to get the best air flow as if I bent the fan anymore it wouldn't work.  It also has a loud sound. Once I worked this all out, the fan is ok.  I do have 2 out of 5 fans that don't work at all!"
5.0,"This SD card does work with the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.  I was unable to format with a windows 7 machine, however utilized my macbook pro disk utility to format.  Works greats reads and writes videos and pics fast.  I have not tested saving apps yet, but will adjust the review when I get the chance."
1.0,Not happy with the case. Thought it would be thicker and front of case would have better protection. Front of case only will protect against scratches.
2.0,"Needed smaller connection, and the size is misleading in the ads"
2.0,These are baby slippers. Junk!
1.0,"I love the styling, but this was completely worthless for a small drop with a 2-week old tablet. 4 year old dropped it from her waist height (about 20 inches) facedown onto a hard floor. The entire screen shattered. Now I'm looking at a $200+ repair bill."
2.0,"I ordered a 128 GB microSD card and was sent a 32 Gb microSD card.<br />It is a microSD card, but does not have the memory I wanted. Now I have to go through the hassle and expense of returning it and getting a replacement. What a huge hassle!"
2.0,Tried this with its adapter on DSLR Camera and got some errors at times while trying to save data to card.  It is ok for other uses like computer external data.
3.0,It don't work right
4.0,"Once I finally got the Range Extender properly configured and located in the right spot, it is providing exactly the performance for which I was looking.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the installation may not be as turnkey as most users would like. I am retired but am still fairly technical. I have a computer science degree, worked as a systems engineer for a computer company, worked in R&D for a computer company, and managed systems and software development for two companies. I usually have no difficulty getting a new device installed and properly configured.<br /><br />It simply would not work for me with the supplied installation CD. I went on the Linksys web site and downloaded the latest firmware (build 6) but going to 192.168.1.1 didn't take me to the Range Extender set up; it took me to my wireless router set up. I went into the Control Panel into the Network and Sharing Center and clicked on See Full Map. The map itself does not show the Range Extender but below the map is listed the devices discovered that could not be placed on the map. There I found the RE4000W. By right-clicking on that icon, you get the option to View Device Webpage. Clicking on that, I was indeed brought to the set up screen for the Range Extender. For me, its ip address was 192.168.1.247. This allowed me to log in (username blank, password admin), install the latest firmware and change the device's password to something other than the default admin for security purposes.<br /><br />I then downloaded the latest product installation program from the Linksys web site and ran it to install/configure the Range Extender. Note that it did not connect the first time, but the installation screen lists a number of possible reasons. One of the reasons is that you don't want your installation device (a laptop in my case) too close to the Range Extender itself. I was about five feet away. When I moved into another room, I was able to get a successful installation.<br /><br />Now the challenge was where to located the Range Extender &#34;permanently&#34; in the home. My wireless router is located in our basement, and I purchased this Range Extender to help my laptop connectivity from my home office on the main level of the house. Prior to the Range Extender installation, if I used my laptop in the kitchen which is directly above the wireless router location in the basement, I got a five bar connection and speedtest.net showed a 24 mbps download speed (I pay for a 20 mbps connection). If I moved my laptop to my home office, I got a two bar connection and speedtest.net showed that my download speed dropped to 1.8 mbps. My hope was that the Range Extender would allow me to get 24 mbps download speed in the home office.<br /><br />My first thought was to place the Range Extender in the kitchen directly above the wireless router location. That gave the Range Extender a five bar connection at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz. However, the laptop in my office only showed a three bar connection the the Range Extender and the download speed was only 2.6 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through six walls.) I then moved the Range Extender to the office and observed the reverse of the problem - a good connection from my laptop to the Range Extender and a poor connection from the Range Extender to the wireless router (no connectivity at 5.0 Ghz and two bars at 2.4 Ghz).<br /><br />I then changed the Range Extender location to be on a wall in the kitchen between the original location and the home office. It gave me connectivity at both 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 Ghz but the speed was almost the same: 2.8 mbps. (Note that in this location the signal needed to go through four walls.) My &#34;last&#34; spot to try was putting the Range Extender in the wall outlet on our kitchen island. This location has a direct line of sight from the laptop to the Range Extender and is just 30 feet away. Voila!!! The connection from the Range Extender to the wireless routerhas five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation. However, I can well imagine that other home configurations may not be so forgiving. If I take my laptop to our master bedroom on the second floor of the house, my download speed drops to 20 mbps. If take it to the second floor bedroom on the opposite side of the house, the download speed drops to 2.0 mbps. Clearly, its range is significantly affected by the number of walls through which the signal must pass as well as what is in those walls.has five bars at 2.4 Ghz and four bars at 5.0 Ghz, and the connection from the Range Extender to the laptop has a five bar connection and a download speed of 25 mbps - exactly what I had expected.<br /><br />I rate this Very Good, because it is able to achieve the performance objective for my situation.

1.0,"Acquired this card a month ago for use in my phone Samsung Galaxy S4 and only have taken issues with it.The micro sd card is really bad, the camera takes a long time to be ready and repeatedly resets the phone. Absolutely not recommend it in my previous phone (S3) used a micro sd card 32GB Samsung brand and never had problems with it.To correct the problem of instability recommend formatting the card, I did and the problem remains the same.Live outside the U.S. and I must acquire excellent quality products because the cost of returning it exceeds the cost of the product.Next time buy a card SAMSUNG brand that never gave me problems."
1.0,Couldn't get it to work following instructions to the tee.
1.0,"the enclosure looks very nice and the design makes it very easy to use, but very very unfortunately it did not work, at all.  I couldn't read the disk.<br />This is an update to my first review.  The Customer Service of Inateck contacted me right away with recommendations to test the enclosure to make sure that it doesn't work, and an offer to replace it, if it didn't work.  Unfortunately, I couldn't have followed their recommendations, because I did not have a HHD anymore, as I used the one in the enclosure to replace the internal HHD in my laptop.  At this point, I must rescind my previous review, because I wasn't able to test the enclosure all the way, and conclude its functionality.  I want to thank Inateck for the quick response to my comment and their technical support."
1.0,I ordered a slot-in disc drive. The one I received was not a slot-in.
4.0,it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before
4.0,Small but cheap. I went overboard installing an Arctic cooler for the CPU. Hardly any room for two hard drives. Works though.
2.0,Looking at the picture you would think this is a 2 part case with both front and back covers but you only get the back cover. The picture shows 2 back covers so there is no cover to protect the screen. I thought I was getting something like the cell phone holsters but not so.
2.0,"For me, the chips malfunctioned, causing continuous crashing of all programs. When I removed them and re-installed the original apple chips, all operations ran smoothly again. I purchased the chips because of the great price point, however, if there are any issues and you bring your computer to Apple, it can create issues with your Apple protection plan."
2.0,"This charger was great right up until it quit working less than 4 months after I received it.  Too bad, because I really liked the extra long cord.  BAck to the search bar to find a different one."
1.0,"No green confirmation light, waste of money."
4.0,"I installed this card in a Nook Tablet and attempted to transfer videos to the card from my Windows xp computer - - some transferred okay, others not. Thinking the card was defective I bought another one (same card type) and installed it with the same result. I have had no problems transferring videos to this card from my Windows 7 computer."
5.0,They shipped it out to me right away. Was packaged well and it works very well in my GoPro camera.
2.0,The &#34;padding strips&#34; on the sides that hold the tablet have already come off Twice.  Not very pleased with the fact that it will not hold my 8&#34; tablet securely in place without re-adjusting it repeatedly.
4.0,My iPad fits snug in the case and the strap really helps keep it together when I'm on the go. The case is very light and I can prop my iPad into portriat mode a bunch of different ways with the folds to watch shows and movies.
3.0,A little to tight but very nice
5.0,Perfect for my Dell 7420 12&#34; laptop.  Love that zipper is on the end as I use this in conjunction with my Everki backpack to lug all the computer equipment around.  I can remove the small laptop without pulling the whole thing out of my backpack.
4.0,Does everything it's advertised to do and love the kick stand on the back. Made of sturdy materials should last life of phone
1.0,This is a piece of crap. This is my 3rd card in 3 months. This is ridiculous.Do not buy this crap
1.0,Did not fit the device
4.0,ok. 4 star
2.0,Sandisk 8GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter are not those received are different
3.0,"Even though it says my review is for the 32gb version it's for the 64gb. Not sure why it says 32gb above.I received this card to use in my 2013 MacBook Air for extra storage. I liked that the speeds were up to 30 MB/s. I figured there would be a little bit of a fudge factor but not this much.While I can consistently get almost 45 MB/s read speeds, the write speeds were only around 10.5 MB/s.I guess you could average these together but I don't think that's really the point. :-)I didn't see a review that dealt with this specifically so hopefully this will help someone else out in the future.Update: Only now did I go back and read the tiny print that ""Write speeds may be slower"". Well, that is obvious now but I think 1/4 of the speed is a lot slower."
1.0,This case did not fit my Ipad Air 2 and I needed a new case and now I have to start all over again!!!!! This is such a inconvenience for me!!
1.0,It failed after about one year of using on a samsung Galaxy s4. Now I contacted Sandisk for a potential replacement. I can't format it or do anythin wiith it.
5.0,"My wife really likes the on-off function and the color, I find it a little difficult to remember how to fold the back so it stands up, but it's my wife's and she is happy with it, so that's what counts!"
2.0,"No written directions came with it, and a week after I purchased it, it went on sale for $30.00 less, oh well. I'll give it to one of my grandkids."
1.0,"Did not last 6 months of home use; in a word..Junk.  First the little cushion &#34;feet&#34; fell off in the first month...I should have returned then as a sign of junk.  Now the case is peeling at the edges and loose.  I did not expect magic, but I did expect it to last at least a year of non-rough use."
4.0,I was a little disappoint that my keyboard will not connect but it will plug into the dock. over all I would recommend it.
1.0,Did not work. Got a refund.
2.0,"It doesn't do what I bought it to do... It arrived on time and was nicely packaged.  I bought it to act as a hub between my TimeCapsule and my LaCie Porsche Design P'9233 USB 3.0 Desktop Hard Drive.  My old Anker hub stopped working after about a year and I thought maybe it was just fluke, but my external hard drive doesn't even show up on my network with this new hub.  I tried a different, smaller external hard drive and that also did not show up.  The only thing that showed up on my network when plugged into this Anker USB Hub, which was plugged into my TimeCapsule, was a thumb drive.  I tried several of the standard plugs and all of the IQ plugs."
3.0,average quality based on price
1.0,Scam
4.0,Good product.
5.0,"I've had this card for over a year, and it has worked great as a backup storage source for our digital camcorder (1080p/60).  It seems to keep up just fine, and functions perfectly.The only (albeit minor) nit is that the microSDHC to SDHC adapter seems to not work in all card readers.  I'm not sure why, but it wasn't worth removing a star for that."
2.0,"I've owned two of the Logitech H800 the first pair would no longer charge when the charging port wore out after about 4 months, on the second pair the mic gave out after three months.  I won't be purchasing this product again."
3.0,Pretty good. I've had it for a few months now. My only problem is that the red glow never turns off unless the mouse is unplugged or the power supply is off. Other than that I've had zero problems.
3.0,The range isn't what I expected.
3.0,Needed the small &#34;guides&#34; to make wiring easier.
2.0,"It was nice when it came out of the box, but after a few dozen uses the cover is falling apart. The outside &#34;seams&#34; are coming off and the front is peeling -- something I wouldn't have expected from what is surely light use."
5.0,"I bought this Class 10 SD card for my GoPro 3 Black and it works great! I only recorded with 1080p 60fps with ProTunes and never had any problems. In the past in my GoPro Hero2 it was very picky with the SD card that you use. But so far this card works great. I do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome (card reader, USB version, hard drives, and etc)."

2.0,"Dead in first 90 days, this is not an expensive product and clearly mfg may have cut corners to get the lower price point. This work fine early on but subsequently started to mis-behave and now is simply dead."
4.0,"This memory card is exactly as advertised.  Being Class 10 it is nice and fast.  This card has been in heavy use in my GPSr since I bought it, and I've had no issues with it."
1.0,"I ordered this memory card for my Drift Ghost-S action camera. I started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem. I assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera. Same errors. I switched to a SanDisk Extreme card and never had problems again.If you're going to be recording HD video, especially at high frame rates then do not get this card. I'm sure it would be fine in any other scenario though, but it's advertised as a class 10/UHS 1 card and it's just not as fast as other class 10/UHS 1 cards.Drift Innovation (the company that makes the Ghost-S camera I use) has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any ""SanDisk Ultra cards"" because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors. They work ok until you try recording 1080p video at higher frame rates."
2.0,stopped working after couple of month. Disappointed.
5.0,Compact and works great!!
5.0,I use it to store my music on my android. Works great. Doesn't use that much battery power and doesn't slow down the phone much at all.
4.0,so far so good
5.0,Work out fine.
1.0,The wire began to fray on the inside in about 2 weeks making the noise cut in and out.
1.0,Wasn't supported by Ubuntu Linux 15.04.  Tried to re-compile drivers to no avail!
3.0,Colors not as pictured! Hard case is nice bright yellow. Soft case is kind of a sickly yellow. Mouse is orange.
4.0,"As a tablet, I'm not really fan when it comes to using the Fire for apps. It is great for Amazon Kindle features like Books, Instant Video and Music. Also pretty good for internet usage. A lot of value for the money."
5.0,I got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great!  Inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so I can use it in applications without a micro-SD slot.  This expands its versatility.
4.0,It does what it is supposed to do and the pockets are nice.
2.0,"Might be a good router, but a LOT of compromises. First off, TP-Link relies on a special website address to help configured the router, and they let the domain name lapse! So, if you try to access http://tplinklogin.net, you'll get a domain parking page.<br />Luckily, I've configured a few routers, so I was able to access this by IP address and get started. But, if you're new to setting up routers, forget it, you won't stand a chance. To make matters worse, the TP-Link website is a dumpster fire. Just try to find PDF documentation, etc... For some reason, this website wants to open a new window on nearly every link, circular navigation, etc... its a mess."
2.0,"When I first purchased my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 I so loved it.  I had access to the internet thru my AT&T account anywhere.  I had my books, movies, pictures, documents.  I even used it for work when I went on trips.  It was awesome except for not being able to use google but with all the apps available I was able to do most anything I needed anyway.  Well a little over a year (about a year and 2 or 3 months) after I bought it, therefore, no longer under warranty, I was playing a game right after taking it off the charger and after what looked like an upgrade had happened and it completely died.  There was no way of getting it to even attempt to light up.  I called customer service and they went thru everything with me (40 second hold of the button, etc)  There only suggestion was for me to buy a brand new one for a small discount or I could buy it at regular price over time.  I am sorry to say but that is not a good option.  I have been using Kindle's for years and purchased the very first Keyboard when it was &#62; $200 and that lasted longer than this which cost me ~$600.  I am not spending $600 for something that will only last me a little over a year and then again have the chance of loosing all my .pdf's etc for work.  Thank goodness for the cloud that I was able to get some of my things like my books and pictures.  I truly love my Kindles but this was a great unexpected disappointment!"
2.0,Not working well as disconnects from devices very often and not connecting back.<br />Tried to get replacement but did not get good support.

5.0,"What else can I say? That it is light and small? Not the fastest card on the market, but does the job. Copying files onto it is slow, but it is fast enough to play music or movies from it on your cellphone or other devices."
3.0,Looks good
4.0,"great product,great value  cons would be, product has a weird chemical odor that can be pretty strong.Hopefully it will dissipate with time. trying to fit a mini mouse and power adapter into the slim pocket causes a bump that if anything is placed on top might damage the contents of the pouch or cause the mouse buttons to continually be depressed. My mouse (TEKNET) also sold on Amazon and an awesome product at a great price with tremendous battery life (almost a year) and quality, uses a sleep mode function. After a set time interval of idle activity, the mouse sleeps and is activated by your initial press of the mouse buttons. With no provision in the case to isolate the mouse from external bumps or accidental depression of the keys, you can end up with a dead battery in the peripheral mouse which, when away from a replenishment battery, will leave you stuck with using the trackpad. Not a deal breaker, one might also opt to remove the mouse battery every time after use, but that is not an acceptable solution for me. The Amcase is lightweight, well made and exceptional value for the cost. Customer service from the manufacturer initiated contact with me after my purchase to ensure my satisfaction, that alone should tell you the Amcase people care about their consumers. I would consider this product a definite buy for the daily Chromebook user. I will definitely buy another for my next Chromebook."
2.0,"Poor quality, seems like parts were glued together and the part where the volume keys were suppose to go was bent... So I know what last long. Expect a long wait to receive"
3.0,"This SanDisk UHS-1 TF Card is in good quality.However, it is not working as fast as the Class 10 standard. For operating a series of 4KB files, it can only read at ~2.6MB/s and write at 1.5MB/s.Compared to the SAMSUNG UHS-1 microsd, the SAMSUNG UHS-1 card can at least process 5MB of 4KB files per second, either reading or writing. For reading/writing giant files, This Sandisk card can reach &#62;30MB/S for reading and &#62;15MB/s for writing, which is acceptable for this price, but still a bit lower than SAMSUNG."
4.0,It works perfect👍🏻. Thanks

5.0,"I use this (with a Nifty MiniDrive, [...] to extend the built in SSD in my MacBook Pro. I highly recommend it for anyone needing a speedy flash card."
1.0,I used this as a replacement for an Asus RT-AC66R that failed recently.  The AC66R was a replacement for another AC66R that failed a couple of years ago.  This one worked for two weeks.  All of these were being used as wireless extenders connected to another RT-AC66R configured as a router.  The AC-66R configured is a router is still working.  My experience with Asus products has been a failure rate of 75%.<br /><br />Each of these exhibited the same behavior of dropping random client connections and dropping the connection to the router.  This one is being returned to Amazon.  I'll use the refund to do what I should have done after the first failure and buy a different brand.  My recommendation to anyone looking for a new router is to avoid ASUS products.
5.0,I use it to put my music videos and movies on. Works great with my tablet and there is no stalling on the movies or videos.
4.0,On the smallish side for size 9 hands

5.0,Fast and Reliable micro SD. Very happy with this. And a huge storage capacity for a price that makes me happy.
5.0,OK so far with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I initially received one that seemed to have an issue. It would intermittently save a photo here and there that would become corrupt a short time later. (The DropBox auto upload was fine so I know it was stored OK initially.)Amazon (excellent support) quickly shipped out a new one. The replacement has been working great so far! No sign of the issue I had with the first one.The only con is the time to display contents and read it in MTP mode if it has a lot of files.*** This is NOT the fault of the card. It's a known issue with phones in MTP mode.Note to Rooted GS3 users...I also tried putting the phone in the old unmounted USB mode. I was unable to read it but was able to read a 32GB version of the same card. It appears the GS3 does not support over 32GB in the old USB mode. Possibly part of the reason why they did not include a USB option via phone settings.

It was out of warranty by then... bugger. If it were still here and working, it'd be getting 4 stars. I went the CoolerMaster route when I bought its replacement and, although I don't like THAT keyboard as much, it feels like it'll last a lot longer. Here's hoping..."

Poor engineering It doesn't stay on the base of the computer securely and has cracked from falling off so many times. Extremely disappointed, I buy brands for quality and this is a let down."
5.0,"either it works or it doesn't -- it works, it was a fair price and I am happy with it"
4.0,Excellent cards. I have this one in my ASUS Transformer  and a 16 GB one in my camera. Both work flaulessly.
3.0,Unfortunately the power plug ripped out during the installation proccess.  It looks like it's not glued down so you have to take apart the unit to plug it back it.  Outside of that it works.
5.0,"class 10 is about the best there is and SanDisk hasn't let me down, except that one time when a lock/unlock broke off of a 32gig SDHC card I once bought. Well, out of about a hundred different memory cards I'de say that ain't a bad run. This works GREAT in my son's/wife's touch pad. If you can get one on sale they are GREAT!"
3.0,"The case itself is nice, has a good fit and feel and would definitely offer added protection. The screen protector on the other hand is poorly designed and tested! When the screen protector is attached an air bubble is formed and will get trapped between it and the Kindle screen.  Once trapped it move where your fingers scroll and eventually alters the look and feel of the entire screen. I ended up cutting the screen protector screen out and using just the outer rim. Because the case itself is so nice I still gave it 3 stars, this should be a 5 star product with a little R&D"
2.0,Charge doesn't last long
5.0,I got this to upgrade my tablet to 40GB with the micro SD card. The tablet is a Ainol AX1 with 8GB of storage. I thought i needed more storage for movies. Seems to work just fine.
5.0,I love this kindle!  it's fantastic!
4.0,Works quite well with my iOS devices. Paired without difficulty. Key feel is pretty good for a bargain-priced keyboard. No complaints.
4.0,"This was far tinier than I expected it to be.  In transferring large files, it went a little slower than I would have liked it to, but in the end, it got the job done, which is what counts.  For the price, it couldn't be beat."
3.0,"This is the second Arc Mouse I purchased.  The old white one was wonderful till it stopped working after a few years.  This red one however, has a rubbery covering on the bottom, that scratches and comes off easily with normal use,  after a while it looks ugly, and feels gunky.  So I spent a half hour scraping that rubbery covering off, and like it better now."
3.0,"I bought this card to replace a lost 16 gig in my phone, (HTC G2). Seems to be working perfectly, so I will recommend to all. WAIT!!! read on...I had this card in my phone for a little over a month when it messed up. The phone stop recognizing the card, tried it in the computer and it was not recognized either. I contacted San-disk and they did send me out a replacement but I lost the few pictures I had on the original card. I could have sent the card to San-disk's data recovery people and they would have charged me $275.00 if they were able to recover the data and nothing if they couldn't. A bit to rich for me so I passed and unfortunately lost the photos."
4.0,"My only gripe is I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you never need something like this when it's on sale."
1.0,I was better off with my 32gig card.  This thing was nothing but problems.  The phone does not see it half the time and it is SLOW.  The phone keeps asking to Re- format it.  I got it to see the card after a reboot.  It is still SLOW.I will be buying the Samsung 64gig card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 1.  I have seen good things from Samsung.
4.0,Fits and serves its purpose....satisfied
2.0,"I was expecting SOME link to SOME software, however,  you get a black box with a cable.  No documentation, no web link.  Useless without any type of guidance to a complete system."
1.0,As soon as I installed the battery my computer sent the message that I should replace the battery.  The battery holds a charge for about an hour.
1.0,"Has awful smell, so strong I had to return it.  It smells like a lot of rubber products out of China. I bought two, and they both had the same issue."
3.0,I've only had it for a month.  It works. well enough.  Give me a year and half beyond warranties and I'll really let you know.
4.0,"The mouse is beautiful, and I adore it. It responds well, and the center red button adjusts the mouse sensitivity. I have had 0 issues in the month I've owned it besides the actual blue lights draining batteries like candy. However that is the only issue I've had."
4.0,Pretty decent. It's good at cancelling outside noises. The sound sounds nice and sound hehe.
5.0,I got a few of these for tablets and phones and they have been fine. I loaded them with movies for a trip and they playback was perfect. I used one in a camera for video and it was plenty fast enough for the clips I was taking.
5.0,"This iDeaUSA tablet cover is ideal for a 7 inch tablet. It is made of high quality leather. It is beautiful and has a sleek design. I got it as a sample a month ago, and I can say it's very durable. It does a great job protecting my tablet from dust, scratches, and any type of damage. The cover is water resistant, so it's an overall protection. A perfect case."
5.0,"The subject says it all.  Does what it's supposed to do ... at a great price.  When it's on sale, buy it."
4.0,"Performs as it is supposed to. 16gb is quite a lot of storage plus my Samsung Galaxy has 15 gb of internal memory for a total of 32 gb. That's plenty enough to store hundreds of hours of music,"
4.0,"I just bought two of these for our two new Samsung Galaxy IV smart phones.  The adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these MicroSD cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the USB &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now I don't worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips I might want to show someone on the phones."
5.0,Product shipped on time. Part worked well
5.0,its 64 gigs it works great not sure what else to say about it really. Not much else to say.
2.0,Did not come in correct color but did not have time to send it back
4.0,"Good computer.  Not as speedy as I was expecting.  Many problems installing Windows 10, but can't fault the laptop for that.  Just can't figure out why it is so slow."
2.0,I need to constantly unplug and plug it back in for it to work :-(
2.0,"I ordered this and tried to set it up with my CenturyLink VDSL connection. I was unsuccessful so I called CenturyLink. They asked if I had set VPI to 0 and VCI to 32. The Trendnet AC750 only showed VPI/VCI as N/A. So I called Trendnet and they told me there was no way to set VPI and VCI on the their modems. They advised me to return it which I did. I give it 2 stars since the customer service as very helpful and the set up menu was easy to use, but it does not work with CenturyLink VDSL."
4.0,"Works exactly as advertised. I do, however, wish they would have made it REALLY clear what the abilities of this thing are in terms of power and how much load you can put on this thing. If I hook up an external 2TB hard drive I have, it is unable to supply enough power for my xbox 360 wireless dongle. Or, it comes in and out so it is not reliable or stable. BUT, I was sort of wondering if this would even work that way or not. It still allows for me to use at least 1 USB device and have hard wired connection for ethernet with my surface pro 3 (originally only 1 usb port) so I'll be keeping it and using it for that.<br /><br />CON: the device itself was showing exposed wires where the cable meets the hub. It's not lose or anything, just a minor, professional looking con that I have to ding for."
5.0,"This has got to be by far the BEST microSD card on the market. It is very fast, was easy to set it up. I am using it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works flawlessly. Well worth the money."
1.0,This thing is not working properly- I will need to send it back and get another one.
3.0,"When I bought this a year ago, I had problems with it working properly in my Sprint E4GT (Galaxy SII).  The card kept waking up the phone to be read, over and over.  SanDisk acknowledged this problem in &#34;some&#34; android devices and shipped me a new card once I returned this one to them.  The new card still had the same problem, so I gave up.  The card is fast, and I got a good deal on the price, so I am pretty disappointed about it."
1.0,"This charger gets extremely hot when being used, makes a buzzing sound, and is not safe. I would not recommend this device to anyone! DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,This is a horrible laptop do not recommended I got it and I've had problems with it since day one not satisfied not worth the price😠😠😠
4.0,Great item.
4.0,Works great. Kids love it
1.0,"Was working fine for 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Is not recognized by my computer or cell phone. I am beyond the Amazon return window, so this absolutely sucks.Wasted my money."
4.0,great deal
5.0,Not much else to say - an SD card is an SD card - performance met expectations - have had good luck with Sandisk
1.0,"Ordered this for a Galaxy S3.  Lasted a few months and then broke.  Is not accessible on several different PC's.Says ""limited lifetime"" warranty - BS.  You have ONE MONTH for Eco Zone.  Not only did I lose pictures but now I am out $$ because of a crappy return policy.In the future I will be buying Kingston, not Sandisk.-----------------Update:  Amazon Customer service made good and refunded my purchase price.  I still will not be buying any more Sandisk memory cards however..."
1.0,"This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely. I have tried every possibility to get this to work, but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones. Every workaround I have tried to get this card to work, it still causes my phone to freeze."
2.0,"this mat is &#34;meh&#34; for me. I know two other gamers who own and like this exact mat, so I gave it a shot. Of the three of us, I'm the only one with a Razer mouse, both of them have the same strange issue of &#34;lagging&#34; on the pad, as if i was using a magazine as a mat. aside from that, which may end up being a hardware issue (however unlikely, having un/reinstalled all drivers and calibration etc), I find it to be much too thin and light, and it slides around my desk with normal use. The size is nice, but that hardly makes up for it's shortcomings in my opinion. in short, there are better mats at walmart for a similar price."
5.0,"This memory works great on Surface Pro 2, no problems at all, transfer rates are acceptable. Before the Surface Pro 2's firmware update, the memory was disconnecting itself, I had to take it off and put it on again, but after the firmware update, I have no problems, the memory always stay there."
2.0,"Worked well the first day, now it doesn't work at all. Wouldn't recommend. Its cheap feeling and its better if you shell out a few extra bucks for a decent brand, not this generic china crap."
3.0,"to be completely honest, it's pretty s***ty, but it gets the job done. For $10 I'm not complaining but it's only worth about that. It came a little bit broken - which doesn't really matter as it only makes it click a little bit when I type and I'm just using it until I find a better one I like, but I definitely wouldn't use this long-term. It's really cute though, and the color is exactly what it looked like in the picture."
3.0,I've using two of these on my new TS-253p for a week now and it looks like they are performing like expected.<br />WD and Amazon are advertising these drives as NASware 3.0 but I received one 2.0 manufactured in 2013 and another with 3.0 manufactured in 2015. Based on what I read it looks like is not a big deal in an event of a failure but still the description from the manufacturer is misleading. I will also post some feedback to the seller about the way Amazon ships drives.
5.0,"Basically a good 3-button mouse.  It works, does what it's supposed to do."
5.0,Quick and easy! Works great.
4.0,colors are awesome and even in bright light this is super bright and visible. only thing is a couple of the keys stick
4.0,Snapped into place easily and seems secure.  Haven't had it very long yet so I cannot comment on durability.
1.0,"The connection piece that goes from the headset to the controller does not work, people can hear me but I cannot hear them, I'm dissatisfied because after all, I paid for one day shipping, and still had to switch to my old mic."
2.0,The product was great then I noticed the charging port broke last week. I've only used it 4 times so I am a bit sad. I only charge it in my home and I don't believe I am forceful...very confused and concerned.
2.0,"This mouse is low priced and works good. It's not full sized but not as small as a travel mouse. However, after a couple of months of normal use, it's starting to act erratically: The scroll wheel has gotten weird and sometimes causes the the page to go in the opposite direction that you want. The cursor will move around mysteriously if the mouse isn't perfectly flat on the mousepad. The left-click button works intermittently now that the mouse has some wear and tear on it.  I'll keep it as a spare, but it got so annoying that I spent a little more and got another Logitech mouse that will probably last forever unless I physically break it somehow."
3.0,"Does its job. But it is not sensitive enough, always have a bit delay. Also, when make a click the cursor sometime jumps to another position.<br />I always love logitech 's products, and I feel disappointed this time."
1.0,Single worse product I have ever ordered.  I ordered 4 and each of them failed in the same way and failed immediately.  They are junk and the screws do not hold and they do not stay in the cheap plastic.  This is not effective as a security device nor can it even hold a tablet on the wall.  This would be an awful April fools joke to play on someone.
1.0,"Worse router I've used. Almost traded in my linksys for their rebate thing and I'm glad I didnt.<br /><br />The setup was easy very very simple and it's fast but then exactly 24 hours later none of my devices would connect, over wifi that is. A quick reboot fixed the problem but do you really want to reboot your router everyday!?<br /><br />My old router is still good and I wanted to replace it to have a better range. Maybe they can fix the issue with a software update because everything else was perfect especially the range."
3.0,none
2.0,"When it works, its great. But every few days, when I go to open it, its just a blank white screen.  I looked online and contacted asua support and no one had an answer. Asus told me to do a factory reset, which solved nothing. Now I can't send it in to get repaired because I need it everyday for college.<br /><br />Buy if you're willing to gamble. Maybe it'll be reliable, maybe not. Asus tech support was slow and unhelpful."
2.0,It worked well for about a month then my girlfriend broke it. Keep in mind this made cheaply and will break easily if you are not gentle with it. I got it for the gym I goto since they use the Apple connectors and I have the G4.
2.0,"This laptop came with a sticky W key, which is very annoying when you play 3D shooters with WASD keys. W sticks and gets stuck for about half a second, then unsticks with a bit of a rubber sound. I returned the 1st laptop and got replacement from Amazon (Amazon was great!). The 2nd laptop came with the same defect. All keys are OK, but W is sticky. Not sure how Asus tries to position it as a &#34;gaming laptop&#34; when one of the most important keys is broken. Not sure what to do next... return probably. Also, the laptop comes with lots of crapware including one known &#34;antivirus&#34;... Asus should be ashamed to sell this subpar laptop for that much money."
4.0,"Nice case, somewhat thick"
5.0,"SanDisk SDSDQUA-064G-U46A Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card.  Not much to say about this card other then the fact that it is working well.  My research had me believe that this was a good and fast card and I have no complaints using it in my Galaxy Note 3.Using Samsung's 'Kies' files transfer app on my Mac, I've had no problems transferring music, videos, docs, and other files to and from this card."
5.0,"Well I was almost going for less space memory for my Sony Xperia ZL, but wow 32 GB of memory is a must these days I love my choice and this product works very good! Excellent."
2.0,"It worked great for the first few months.  Then started having issues with the touch screen.  Then the charging port went bad and I had to send it to ASUS for repair.  The charging problem was fixed but the touch screen issues were not.  It seems to be temperature sensitive-in cooler environments it functions properly but when it's warmer the touch screen won't work at all.  Also, the charging port that got replaced is going bad again.  This tablet would get five stars if it actually worked properly."
5.0,I bought 3 when they were on sale but I did buy 1 prior to the sell. I use it in my go pro and it works great. (I can't compare to others tho because this is the only memory card I've used before)
4.0,It's good. Great size. I love it for the most part. Don't like that it can't play audio books. Don't like the adds but that's  ok if you get the Amazon kindle case and disable the lock screen by  typing ~ds in the search bar.
3.0,"After having the switch for a little over a year, the USB switch part frequently just stops working.  Initially it worked great, now, I have to pull the power, pull USB cables, power it up and re-insert the USB cables.  I'm shopping for a new one."
2.0,This didn't work as expected.
2.0,"With a full battery, one of the fire tablets i purchased will shut off b for no reason and not turn back on"
2.0,"First and foremost, ignore the crossed out $199 price tag that Amazon is for some reason letting these crooks display on their website.  This tablet has never and will never be a $200 quality tablet.  You basically get what you pay for here, which is a $60 tablet that functions like you would expect from a $60 tablet...  And that's not good.  Especially when these are clearly advertised for you to buy for your child.  If your child is under the age of say 3, this might be an appropriate first tablet.  Children older than 3, or ones smart enough to know a piece of junk when they see it, will likely just hate you for being so cheap.  The battery life is abysmal.  If your child gets 2-3 hours of play before it dies, they will be lucky.  Similarly, the amount of time the battery takes to charge just as terrible, if not worse.  It has virtually no storage space, so you'll spend most of your time trying to convince your child that they have to erase games they have no interest in erasing.  And chances are once you get something new installed, it's going to run so slow that it's virtually unplayable.  The only reason I gave it a second star is because it hasn't entirely died as of yet, and because miraculously it's reasonably sturdy when it comes to being dropped/abused in ways that most young children handle their toys.  So again, you're basically getting exactly what you pay for.  A cheap tablet at a cheap price.  If you are generally trying to buy something for a child you actually care about, spend another $40 and get them a legitimate tablet.  These people posting 4/5 star reviews must really dislike their kids."
2.0,"Venue 11 Pro 7130 I5.  Great design, quality material, fit was tight and secure.  However, if you put the tablet in as shown in the picture, the charging port was blocked, and if you flipped it, the &#34;Windows&#34; button and cooling vents were blocked.  Completely un-usable for the 7130 I5.  This could have been a fantastic product as everything about it is quality.  It just doesn't fit the intended tablet.  Unfortunately, I had to return it."
4.0,"This little drive is great for storing files so I can access them which ever computer I'm using at the time. I switch from one computer to the other because of chronic pain, and got tired to not having the file I wanted to work on right then where I was (and I always forget to carry the USB sticks from one computer to the other). This has cured that problem.<br /><br />I had no problem getting it to work on the laptop & desktop (both PCs), but had trouble with my iPad. I have an old iPad II and the driver I found for it at the App Store is apparently an older one or something because the user manual shows features my drive does not have, and while I can access files *from* the iPad, I cannot move any files from the iPad on to the drive so I can access them on the PCs. Hopefully another driver shows up so I can have full access to everything. If it would do that, I would give it five stars!"
5.0,You may  think that it is not worth spending the extra few bucks for this version of micro SD but trust me it is this transferred about 8 gbs of music in 10 minutes with the original  version it took about 25 minutes on the same computer. So it is definitely worth the extra few bucks.
3.0,It's a little &#34;loose.&#34;  I presume but don't know for certain that Evercase markets this one for the Asus Zenbook UX303 13.3 and the same one for other sized laptops around 13-14 inches.
3.0,"Works ok, better than the old battery I replaced. Does not lost very long at around 3 hours though, and I carefully followed the directions. Of running it down to 7% then charging and the back to 7% three times. Get what you pay for I guess."
2.0,It's extremely thin.  I can barely get it to zip up with the laptop and power cord.
4.0,SanDisk makes some great memory chips for a decent price. I can' recommend no names brands because of their error frequency.
4.0,good product
4.0,For the price these cards provide a good compromise in terms of speed and cost.  I use them with IOGear USB 3.0 adapters and they work well in that capacity.
1.0,"Got here really, really fast!  I guessed when I first bought this that the $13 for this meant it wouldn't work. Money down the toilet. But in case it did, it would be a GREAT deal!  Got it (again, really, really fast!); plugged it in and charged it for 24 hours. No charge. None at all.  Attached it to another like computer and plugged that in for 24 hours. No charge. None at all.  $13? Yeah, not worth sending it back."
2.0,too small
1.0,"Defective product, didn't work with W540 laptop.  Didn't fit flush, which isn't a problem, it just failed to function.<br /><br />Probably a defective unit. Returned it and am going to buy a different one which actually works and fits flush and looks better (the fake panel on the side says all kinds of dumb garbage.)"
3.0,"It is well made and looks good but, the speaker holes do not line up. No matter how I put the tablet in."
2.0,My daughter still found a way to crack her screen while in this case w the screen protector on :(
1.0,THE Tablet Is GOOD But THE CHARGER Doesn't CHARGE. I have to use my charger to my phone.l need another charger sent to me...
1.0,"Does not work already. Sparked last,time I plugged it in."
1.0,Skips all over and can't control mouse-Returned
3.0,"This isn't the greatest product in the world, but it works. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get the Bluetooth connection going on my iPod Classic, but it does indeed work.<br /><br />Besides the occasionally fiddly connection problem, my only complaint is that if you're listening to your iPod via this thing, you cannot adjust the volume on the iPod - you have to do it on whatever the Bluetooth is interfacing with, like the wireless speaker...which can be a problem if you have a certain kind of speaker that only gets so loud.<br /><br />Beware: this thing is VERY EASY TO LOSE!<br /><br />But hey, for the purchase price, this is a pretty good deal."
4.0,"Fast card, reliable performance.  Got this card for my Galaxy S3, no compatibility issues.  Would buy again for in a heart beat."
3.0,Nice marterial and product however it was much smaller than expected. Even the water bottle and phone slot is smaller than standard. There are a lot of pockets so there is room to put things else.  It'll still be useful. Just not for what was originally intended.
2.0,"I bought this to use with my Thinkpad T440 laptop and 26&#34; monitor, which supports only DVI and dsub connectors.  When run through the DVI cable, this adapter produced horizontal green lines and dots all across the image, which made it unusable.  I tried a DVI to HDMI adapter and ran an HDMI cable to this, and still received green dots on the screen, although less than with DVI.  In screen mirroring mode, it was usable.  But if I tried to &#34;Extend&#34; the displays, the horizontal green lines came back.  I know it's not the quality of the cable, because a different brand DP to HDMI adapter works flawlessly with the exact same components and cables.  I may have got a defective one, YMMV."
3.0,It's cheap feeling but most certainly get the job done.  Some keys like to stick though not often but it does happen
2.0,"Cute, but batterytakes all night to charge, and runs down quickly.  Camera is bad, don't bother using it."
2.0,"This device works fairly well in router mode but I bought it so I could use it in Bridge Mode when travelling to get around motel Internet sign-on screens and use my Chromecast.  I expected it to be a little slower but when in Bridge Mode it is usually unbearable slow, I say usually because a few times it seemed OK but generally I have found it to be unusable for this purpose.  At the last Motel I tried it at the normal connection speed (using the OOKLA speed test) was 15Mb Down and 5 Mb Up. Connecting via this device made it .9Mb Down and .9Mb Up and it was continually disconnecting.  I tried the latest Firmware with no change in performance.  The HooToo web site provides little or no useful support information.  I will continue to watch for updates but for now I am going to try the Netgear Trek, hoping I get better results."
4.0,The drive itself is an excellent product. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is the cable interface. The cable it does with is very short and for many uses a longer cable is needed. It has a non-standard USB interface which necessitates buying a special cable not readily available locally.
4.0,"Case fits great. Others have said the bottom didn't fit right but so far it fits great. The color is more of an orange color. Take your time putting the case on (no instructions included), I accidentally put the screen cover on upside down and was very hard to remove."
4.0,"It definitely fit my laptop, an HP Pavilion g7 2220us, and was pretty easy to install. I just followed a video on youtube and it took about 20-30 minutes. However, I noticed that this screen was not as glossy as the OEM and that the colors were not as bright and vivid. It sort of looks like a hybrid half glossy, half matte, if that's even a thing. Either way, it was worth the money I saved. I don't know what the OEM cost of the screen is but this one is on par with other replacement screens I've seen online."
4.0,Never had any issues with sandisk adapter card or devices. They work great and this one is no exception. Very small media for my big fingers but I manage. to do what I need to with it and it works well. Last thing is that Amazon's prices are hard to beat!
5.0,Great product
1.0,"Horrible piece of junk!! Only used twice and it failed disastrously! Just quit working, no indicator light, nothing. Same thing happened with a PNY 32GB &#34;Attache&#34;. These were for my desktop computer; never carried anywhere, never exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. I own, or have owned dozens of flash drives, by many of the leading makers and these PNY's are the only ones to have just plain failed. Stay away from PNY!"
2.0,"The height of the cable end seems too high, because when trying it with my Macbook Pro's ethernet port, it doesn't fit in all the way and snap into place. While it works, if I move my laptop it will come undone and I lose my ethernet connection. I tried it in my router as well, and it won't fit all the way like and click like my other ethernet cables. It doesn't seem to be a manufacturing defect, since I've bought several of this exact cable. Seems like a huge oversight and large inconvenience. That said, the price and quality of the connection is good."
2.0,Caps lock key doesn't work.
1.0,next to my router it cant even play hd videos. has no gain and it gets me about .25 gb down and .01 up. my other 14 inch antennas het me perfect 30 up 30 down
4.0,Works...after almost a year I started to lose internet even with full signal from extender.  It turns out that there are more wifi signals in the neighborhood which caused interference.  A friend suggested changing the channel on the router.  Now I have no problems.  Most people use the default channel 1 and everyone was interfering each other.
5.0,As promised!
3.0,Not bad but was hoping to get a little more distance between the keyboard and player. Anything more than 5 feet and it would get pretty jumpy on the mouse movements
2.0,Product works with all but windows 2000 OS.  Your system must be XP or later for this to work correctly.
2.0,"I was disappointed to find that it was for a 13&#34; Macbook ONLY. Unfortunately the description says it fits 13&#34; or larger, which technically is true, but Jordan is too far from touching the bottom of the computer, which makes him look obviously too small for my 15&#34;, and it's awkwardly disrespectful to cut off the limbs of the greatest basketball player of all time. I decided to toss my purchase. If you have a larger computer, save your money for another product. The product itself is okay, you get what you pay for, but the description could have been updated to reflect what should actually be expected for the &#34;or larger&#34; part."
3.0,"An ok design except for one thing: The fan intakes are flush with the bottom of the unit, so if it's being used on your lap or any other soft surface, the fans can't bring in enough air to pump out. I tried it. It's not that the fans don't run, they just won't put out enough air from the top surface. Since laptops run hot I'd rather have fans pumping full the whole time. There are two pop-out stands to put the unit at an angle, but they only work on a hard surface. I didn't want to but I ended up returning it to Amazon."
3.0,"Won't stay connected to the WiFi, am having to constantly log in no matter where I am (public, home, etc)."
2.0,I may have gotten a defective unit.  It didn't pass the speed test when I compared it to my other old wires.
5.0,After I ordered my GoPro Hero 3 Black  I started searching for a good MicroSD card and everywhere I looked they wanted like $80for a 64GB  and digging around on eBay get's retarded at times  then by chance I found this one for $55 TTD  and the performance is awesomeI tell you all if you are in the market for a GoPro Hero3 Black  get this card to go with it  you wont be sorry....
5.0,Sandisk class 10 as far as memory cards to me is the best! As for the price of $20+ this card is all you need for advance cameras phones ext. I bought it for my Go Pro Black edition and it worked flawlessly without and buffering error. For my money Sandisk is where I would put my money on before any other memory card...
1.0,"Horrible, never worked in any of my devices.  Kept being mounted and unmounted."
2.0,Dead after 8 months.
2.0,"It may be the specific keyboard I received and not the product in general, but the E, R, and T keys are much stiffer than the other keys (and much stiffer than keys on a keyboard should be) and this makes typing a misery, since I either have to hit those keys very hard, or I end up with missed letters. Since I use my keyboard constantly for my work, I will be replacing this keyboard tout suite."
4.0,Purchased two 32 GBcards  for the two new Samsung S4s in or family.  After using for several weeks no issues at all saving a variety of files - photos and Office documents.
4.0,Good cover like it a lot
1.0,"Poor quality product. I thought I was getting a great deal, unfortunately the adapter did not work. No return = $5 I am never getting back.<br /><br />I would suggest finding another higher quality product that does actually work."
2.0,I like the device but the app that goes with it has issues (Android) it will not read/write to the external SD card that is in your phone or tablet. My guess it's a port from iOS so doesn't even know that such a thing exist. If you have a device with an external SD card forget it you'll have to use a 3rd party app to transfer files to or from your SC card.
4.0,I love the tablet. I do wish that I could load an sd card though to put my son's movies on for when we travel. The audio and graphics are very clear.
1.0,Motherboard fried at 1 year & 28 days. I will not buy Dell anymore.
1.0,It was the wrong size and was difficult to put on.
3.0,"So far have to give it a 3/5, its a great little computer but have been have major issues with it so far.  The biggest one being that sometimes when I try and log on it will just get stuck in loading and will never actually log me on."
3.0,"When I bought this I did not know just how small it would be, which is my own fault. It works fine, but is incredibly awkward because its smaller than an outstretched hand. Hard to tell if you hit a button or not or if you hit multiple buttons because there is no feedback."
2.0,I received that tablet pretty fast. But once I start and put 1 app on it  it went down hill after that. This is after a full day of charging it. The touch keypad was to sensitive. It would jump from one page to another as soon as I started it. It would open apps with out even touching the screen. It would even turn on and off over and over again all day long without even touching it.
2.0,"This is my first Kindle Tablet although I've used the Kindle and Audible programs for years.<br /><br />I have a Nook HD and a Kobo Aura but I was looking for a size a little bigger than my phone and smaller than my other tablets. When the 6 inch went on sale I got it.<br /><br />I've had it for three weeks and have used it nearly every day for mainly audio books.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />The screen though small provides vivid pictures and is super responsive. The Whispersync feature is a huge bonus for me and the one thing that will keep me with Kindle when all else fails. The selection of books and movies is staggering, which is what drew me to owning one.<br /><br />However there are some deficiencies I can't overlook. First, for a tablet so small it's extremely heavy. It's harder to hold up than my hardback copy of Gone with the Wind. It's heavier than my Nooh HD 7 inch and that has a protective case. Plus when you use it over an hour or so it gets hot...like burn-your-hands hot and I have to prop it up with a pillow instead of holding it. Then finally the audio book interface is less interactive then the downloaded version on my phone. As an readers I've never been impressed with Kindle. Nook and Kobo are far superior but the whispering technology was what set them apart. But if their tablet  isn't any better than the program I can download on my Nook, why would I purchase a Kindle?<br /><br />I expected better and was disappointed."
4.0,Good enough for the price!!!
5.0,This is an absolutely gorgeous cover and is well-made of quality materials. I have severe arthritis in my hands and the wide elastic band helps me to hold my kindle on create comfort. It's a great buy--can't recommend highly enough!!!
3.0,Neat idea in a world where you can't always trust your computer to not watch you.  I'm not paranoid but I am a technologist and I have children and I know I can't always make sure that they don't accidentally download a RAT or something else that might allow someone to peep on them.  So I just stuck these on their computers and told them to make sure to close them when they're not using them.
4.0,"It's a very great case though on the edges it has started to fade😓that's really sad because I love this case and everything about it. Very protective, I have dropped it a little but it protected great"
4.0,Types very nicely and Extra keys provide shortcuts which is a timesaver. The only feature that would be helpful is if the case had a latch to keep the case closed when not in use. I would still highly recommend this product.
5.0,"I bought this item to use in my gopro hero 3 because it's what they sell on the gopro website, but can be had a lot cheaper on Amazon.  Have yet to have problems with the card."
4.0,good !
1.0,Fell apart ver quickly!
2.0,"This was probably the sweetest looking mouse I had ever seen looking at it in its clear packaging but the unfortunate reality is that this thing feels cheap as hell. The unit is really light to the point where it feels like a cheap hollow shell. Very quickly, the plastic texture will start to visibly show where your fingers and palm rest on it, with  a dark mark, making it look dirty even if you clean it. It often makes really awful squeaking when you click. This is caused  by crumbs getting  under the buttons and can be corrected but it can be pretty  difficult and I find myself having to do so so often that I just gave up. Its just always squeaky. This is an ambidextrous mouse but it is implemented very poorly. The grips that keep your fingers from dragging on the mousepad, that were a major selling point for me, can't really both be used at the same time because both are curved to fit a thumb. Its really uncomfortable for the other fingers and while you can of course swap that side for the alternate grip, your fingers will then drag on the mouse pad. I also think it looks pretty unappealing aesthetically when you have mismatched side grips. The battery life is pretty bad too. From a full charge I can get 4, maybe 5 hours of use out of it. The laser often performs very poorly. It sometimes will fail to detect mouse movement, it will randomly lower the dpi level without input and it fails to recognize when you try to adjust it with the buttons. Really frustrating when you're in the middle of a game of league. And all this in under a weeks worth of use, I went right back to my Rat MMO. Huge waste of money, the price is absolutely absurd considering the build quality. This would be more appropriately priced at around $40. If you want a high end gaming mouse (like &#62;$100) you would be better off with any of the other razer micete"
1.0,"I'm a retired IT Professional that spent over 30 years in IT with a primary focus on data communications. I'm technically competent enough to understand router technologies. Linksys has either idiots on the Technical Support for this router or the router has some serious design flaws.<br />I bought one from amazon and don't have any issue with them. BUT, after several lengthy conversations, the only way they determined that could resolve my problem was to send a replacement. Replacement has the same issue - consistent speed problems that kept my iMac at about 30mbps with a speed out of my Motorola cable modem in the 90mbps. I run an iMac A7 which screams and needs the more bandwidth than this router can provide. Only other item running through the router is an iPad OR my wife's Dell laptop. Finally replaced with a Netgear product that works like a champ. STAY AWAY from this router if you need a WiFi Router that works at higher speeds."
3.0,"Cover is cute and durable, but the magnet that's supposed to put your iPad in sleep mode doesn't work. I have to remember to lock my iPad before closing the cover or it'll stay on and use my battery."
1.0,"I put this NEW sd card in my NEW GS4 for the first time, and now the metal contacts are scratched and it randomly unmounts from the phone!  My older 32GB SanDisk works just fine, so I'm thinking its the thicker paint or something causing this...  I don't know, but its ruined!  It scratched the first day, but I'm just now noticing the unmounts now that I have my music on it, every few songs it will unmount and remount, interupting my music...  I'll never buy another expensive SanDisk.  I'm going to order a different brand, just make sure I can find one without paint on it....  Sucks, I really thought this was going to be a good one!  I love the colors, and its so fast to transfer files to.... too bad its broken.  And I didn't find out about it until after the return date, so i'm screwed.  Oh well.  Never again, I'll give my business to someone else...."
1.0,5G did not work. Returned it for refund.
2.0,"I've had this keyboard for about 2 weeks now. Its not a very good keyboard. I suggest you save your money and buy something else. The keys constantly get stuck and you need to press certain keys like the ctrl button at a certain angle otherwise they will get stuck as well. The function keys are also positioned in a certain way that some might be uncomfortable with. The good thing I can say about this keyboard is that it is sturdy, but other than that, its pretty horrible."
3.0,"Doesn't  fit  as snugly  as an otterbox, but still  is great for the price."
1.0,"I would not recommend this computer to anyone. I bought mine new yet it had problems from day one which never got fixed. It came that way too because I have never damaged it. I mailed my laptop to Lenovo repair twice in the first 6 months of owning it but they never actually fixed the problems. They tried to tell me I was out of warranty when I sent it to them 3 months after I bought it new! What a trick! I tried to like Lenovo and I gave the company every chance to keep me as a customer but I got nothing but bad repair jobs and poor communication from them, as if they never even opened the box but sent it right back to me. This machine is terrible, glitches all the time, suddenly turns off then won't turn back on, is very flakey if it wants to connect to my home wifi or not so I never know if I'll have Internet access, has problems saving documents, won't respond to clicks on icons, is very slow, is not user friendly, has a very confusing app layout and is not easy to figure out at all. It all around is the worst computer I have ever owned and I am switching to Mac permanently. Done with Lenovo."
5.0,The card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam. Would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card.
5.0,"The Sandisk Ultra 64GB Micro Card is a great addition to maximize the Samsung Galaxy IIIS, whatever version you got 16GB or 32GB. Is a very fast memory at a great price. Plenty space for pictures, videos and Android Applications. Good for the 1080 videos that the Galaxy IIIS use. Super Fast. If you got the most advanced smartphone in the market as I do, this is the memory to get at the right price."
3.0,screen protector does help with glare.  the problem with this product is it's slightly too big.  I would trim a couple millimeters off the side and end to make install easier.  hard/ impossible to get all the bubbles out because it covers the screen entirely.  product should be made slightly smaller.  no need to cover every micron of your screen.
2.0,Nice for gaming but my USB 3.0 is not recognized by the computer and also I already tried to install the windows 10 twice and it weren`t able to complete both times. Also the sound sometimes is defective
1.0,My wifi got worse.
4.0,all what I was looking for
3.0,Only reason i gave it 3 stars is the fact that it sparks every time i plug it in. You can still use it but i dont know if you can leave it on the whole day.
1.0,This is junk and I will never buy it again.
3.0,Is it cool? Yes. Does it worth the money? Nope. I may say though that I'm an apple fan so I may be a little bias.<br /><br />The product is great and I wish it was at a lower price where it'll crush the competition. It's versatility is a great advantage over others but the price man....the price...
3.0,It only charges my laptop up to 93% and stops.
4.0,I was able to use this microSD card with my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I just had to format it when it was in the phone.  The only reason not a 5 star is that it's not as fast as the more expensive versions.
1.0,"so small, it's laughable."
4.0,I like the older version ... The book index was much easier to control.  Very nice new features.
2.0,Bought two of these backpacks because they were big and could fit all of my stuff for weekend trips.  The first bag's stitching around the main zipper came undone and then broke rendering the backpack useless.  Then I bought a second and the stitching on the arm let go within the first few months again rendering this bag useless.  I am so frustrated with this backpack as I have spent around $110 on buying this bag twice and both fell apartment on me pretty quickly.
3.0,They function as they are described but the springs hold onto your head too tightly and unless you have a real skinny head it makes them very uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time ..
4.0,"The pendant was beautiful but the chain was broken and stuffed into the back of the pendant.  It arrived in a round tin box which had several bumps and dings.  I planned to give this as a gift but couldn't due to the damage.  Returned for refund, no problems."
1.0,Junk! Purchased for sons bd and it quit working within a month! My seller was poor at communicating and taking care of the issue. Do not recommend!
1.0,Though it says Apple MFi certified - I see the warning comes up saying this is not a supported cable.
5.0,Product works perfectly.
4.0,"Love how it looks!  At first it would not stay snapped on to the laptop, but now it stays securely attached.  Won't protect much against damage caused by impact but protects against spills and dirt."
2.0,"Personally I really didn't like this case for it's style, quality and price. Nothing is wrong with it for protecting your device. I personally didn't like it"
5.0,I have used and tested this memory card on GoPro Hero3 Black Edition and everything works great. No problem at all.
4.0,Good device. Great price
5.0,"Installed as sublimental memory for Samsung Tab 3 8 inch tablet.  Doesn't look like apps can be installed on the card, but that is a Tab 3 issue, not a San Disk issue.  Something to think about when chosing your tablet.  I plan on installing a lot of memory hogging field guide apps, so theTab 3's 16 GB built in memory may be a problem for me.  On the other hand, I have a lot of music, so the SD card will be useful."
5.0,"It is a great addition to a smart phone with huge capacity to store data. Also it is pretty fast to record video, no lag at all during recording."
2.0,get what you pay for! sound is good but mic barley works
3.0,Package came really wrinkled
5.0,"Excellent reliability, etc."
4.0,"Good quality SD memory. The speed suggested is true for the Read speed. The write speed is slower, around 15MB/s."
5.0,"Bought it for my phone, a Samsung Galaxy SIII. Seems to work just fine. Not much else to say. It does what it is suppose to do."
3.0,"The device itself is good, but it suffers tremendously by the lack of a proper strap to attach it to keys, etc."
2.0,I haven't had any luck getting drivers to work with any of the Macs I've tried to install this on across multiple versions of Mac OS X. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it.
1.0,did not work with my laptop. started getting bluescreen
4.0,"I've had this computer for a bit more than a month, and it's done a great job for the most part. People seem to complain about Windows 8.1, but I actually like it with a touchscreen computer. In short, here's my impression:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fast processor: the computer performs well when doing CPU-heavy tasks.<br />- Lovely screen: Photos and videos look really nice on this machine, the touchscreen is responsive and fun to use.<br />- Keyboard: I really like the feel of the keyboard, it has smooth press-action while feeling solid and precise.<br />- USB 3.0: The processor and USB3 ports make for fast file transfers to external drives.<br />- Size: I think the size and weight of this laptop are ideal for traveling. It's thin and light, making it very comfortable to use while out and about.<br />- Noise: Compared to my old laptop, this thing produces minimal noise. It doesn't get hot, therefor is comfortable to use on your lap.<br />- Fast start/shut down: This laptop turns on from being all the way shut off quickly, a huge improvement over my old Win7 laptop.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Touchpad: Something odd happens with the touchpad; even if I disable it, it comes back on. This makes typing annoying at times since if I accidentally swipe the pad it moves my cursor potentially messing with what I'm working on. There's no way to disable the driver for the touchpad either. I've tried everything! Other than that, it's a good touchpad, I'm simply irritated I can't turn it off.<br />- Power cord: The one it comes with is a bit shorter than I like, so I had to buy an extension.<br />- Battery: Depends on what your standards for battery life are, I get on average 4-5 hours out of a full charge if I'm doing a typical workload (1-2 browses open with many tabs, spreadsheets, iTunes, FileExplorer, Adobe software, etc). I suppose this really isn't that bad, but then again compared to a Mac this may not be enough for some people (i.e. 8-9 hours with a MacBook Pro, however it's twice the price).<br />- Shift key: Lastly, and perhaps a little nit-picky, the right shift key is smaller than the left one so it's taken some practice to not hit the wrong key.<br />-I have found NO WAY to disable the automatic screen dimming feature, it's driving me nuts. I've tried several different methods to turn it off, even editing the registry, but nothing worked."
3.0,"For $6 it is kind of worth it in a pinch, but this will fail on you. I got about 3 months on this particular charger, but I didn't know how much longer I was going to keep using my old laptop, so it worked out for me at the time.<br /><br />If you keep this charger stationary it may last a lot longer as the cord from the power brick part to the laptop is the one that will fail. After a while I had to wrap the charger cord around the laptop to get the charger to work, and then it finally stopped working all together."
4.0,To be honest i purchased this because my son said I needed it with my tablet...I'm sure it will be fine...
1.0,"UPDATE:This card stopped working as of late February 2013, after only about 2 months of regular use.  There are 492 similar complaints about this card (now 493...) and this is 17.5% of 1 star out of 2918 reviews...  At first I thought it was my phone not being able to find it, or the card would often spontaneously dismount, and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card.  Formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two...  Plugged it into the desktop directly, and the same thing happened.  Got another card of another brand, and everything has been working well since early March 2013 with the other card. So it was not the phone but the card that is at fault.  Very poor longevity. The price is right, but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it.  Amazon only covers 30 days..., so consider this a very expensive 60 day experiment if you are willing to try this brand of card...  Would NOT recommend."
4.0,good batteries
1.0,Was not a 6 ft cord and didn't fit the laptop
1.0,Stopped working in less than a week. Don't waste your money
3.0,The fan itself is great but mounting kit definitely not! The fan has plastic mounting kit on the fan case so the screw might be the broke the plastic hole (which happened to me) and you definitely have to be careful while installing this. Corsair should have change that plastic hole!
1.0,WARNING: This will NOT fit a 2015 Kindle Fire HD7. The camera opening and speakers seemed to be reversed on my model.
5.0,"What else does one need, right?And it does come with the adapter in case you want to use it on the SD slot. or put it into a flash drive adapter to use on your usd PC port.Great price here!!!"
2.0,"Dull finish, not very attractive. I got it because I didnt like the silver color of my laptop. Doesnt seem to ofer any significant protection against bumps. Goes on easily despite lack of instructions."
1.0,"Table slipped out the holder, hit the floor and cracked. Not very secure at all."
1.0,Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging or I'd be returning it. Camera and home button don't line up. Doesn't &#34;stand&#34; right. Pretty worthless. Don't bother.
3.0,"Works fine.  Not a stand out product and not a bad product, but my email is much more difficult to open with this mouse than my former Mouse.<br />Otherwise, it is functional and serves purpose."
4.0,"Love it. Obviously there are a few things that could be better, but they probably have them in the more inclusive models."
1.0,"I dunno if it's a bad copy or what but When I try to transfer files like 2GB or 3GB it doesn't copy! It ejects itself and then mounts itself again. I had to transfer all my songs from my PC through Airdroid which was a pain in the a$$ I can't transfer movies from my PC and by the way I tried formatting it and checking for some errors but same issue but I can move smaller files like 20MB or soVery disappointing especially for such price!UPDATE: Now I have more problems! My phone tells me every now and then that the ""SD card was unexpectedly removed"" and I tried on other phones with the same problem"
3.0,Is fine but a bit cheap made
1.0,"Known bugs and issues with this product. Similar to other reviewers, it worked for a bit, then I began having boot issues."
4.0,"Purchased for use in a dash-camera. Have been using for 2.5 months now without any issues. Not sure what else to say about it, hopefully I get a couple years worth of use out of it."
5.0,very good.But why i do not have packing slip？
2.0,Bottom came with one of the hooks broken...
1.0,"This battery unfortunately worked for a few days, then it just died. I was very disappointed."
5.0,I wanted extra storage for my phone and this 16 GB is a perfect fit and the price was quite reasonable plus it comes from a quality manufacture of memory products.
1.0,"Even i chose the cover for iPad mini, I got the one for a normal iPad."
1.0,"&#60;Standard would be less than one star if it could be&#62; I really tried to like this headset and when it was performing, I liked the quality of the sound ok. BUT. This headset loses connection. It loses it after  minutes, hours, you name it. I tried every driver fix, tried changing the manifest, changed the audio rate, changed my wireless router channel, reset the USB dongle. None of these fixes worked. There is really no answer from Logitech and now with the new headsets coming out, good luck getting any answers from them.<br />TL;DR Avoid this headset, it disconnects and you will want to punch a baby."
3.0,"Just received this monitor and hooked it up. They provided all 3 cables which was nice. This monitor does have speakers built-in which are so-so but I use external speakers anyway. Everything seems great, EXCEPT when I tried to lower the brightness, I hear this high pitch whirring sound. Has anyone else had this problem? If the brightness is anything lower than 98 (out of 100) I hear a high pitch sound. Very odd. I'm contemplating sending it back, unless I can solve this problem.<br /><br />Thanks."
4.0,Perfect starter tool kit.
4.0,Nice.
5.0,For the one that are afraid of buying it to use with your tablet: good news. Is tiny piece of memory works fine with samsung galaxy note N8000. I had to do nothing. Just plug it. no problems at all. It runs smooth so far.
2.0,"This keyboard works as advertised but the right shift key is too small for touch typing. There's simply no way to hit it consistently and the keys around it are functional in ways that will change the field, page or even the screen you're working on. It's so frustrating to be typing away and then look up to find out you're no longer even in the same application you thought you were typing into."
1.0,I bought this mouse only 2 weeks ago and all of a sudden the mouse stopped working. I have switched out the USB many time and changed the batteries over and over. Would not suggest anyone buy this!
5.0,I got this micro sd card strictly to hold music on my HTC One M8. I was able to fit approx 840 albums ripped at 192kbps vbr in AAC format using dBpoweramp. Couldn't ask for anything better. 5 stars.
1.0,"low quality, it stop charging the battery at the second day of use, it just stopped detecting its own power adapter as a valid one and refuses to charge the batter.<br /><br />Not buying DELL again, their AC jack is to poor quality."
2.0,Not good quality. Very visible tiger striping and the adhesive wasn't great.
4.0,"The price was great.  Since this is an SDXC Class 10 card,I expected pretty decent write speeds.  I copied about 30GB of data from my computer HD to this card and it took over 8 hours.Of course, since that was a one-time thing, I didn't really mind.  It works great in my Microsoft Surface Pro.  I just cannot believe that I could find a 64GB micro SDXC card for under $50.  The sale is over, of course, and I've not been able to find them this cheap since.I would buy another one if it were comparably priced."
5.0,"Using the included adaptor on my MacBook Pro to transfer files, I was impressed with the speed of this card."
1.0,I would go no stars if I could.  'Nuf said.
4.0,I added this to my Samsung S3 32gb phone and it works great. I can store most of my music for when i travel. I will nevery have to listen to the same thing on a signal trip.
2.0,"I was so hoping these cords would work well with my iphone, but within a month they began to only charge sporadically.  It seems to be getting worse, so my guess is that within a month, they won't be working at all.  I constantly hear the &#34;ding&#34; going off in my phone telling me that it is connecting then disconnecting over and over.  Buy something else."
1.0,Did not work with AT&T.  Could not program it.
2.0,"I bought two of these adaptors principally due to the very low price. While the materials seem to be of good quality, one of the two has already failed after only a few months of very occasional use (I have had them for about 6 months). One is working fine still, but the other is causing the audio to be garbled and lower volume. I've tried reconnecting the plugs that are plugged into each end as well as trying different cables, etc and the results are the same. It's like something inside has come loose (cold solder joint maybe?).<br /><br />I can't say I can recommend these for this reason. As simple a device as this should be, it should not fail 6 months in especially given the low use of it and the pristine environmental conditions I use it in."
4.0,Mostly Good. I like the capacity though it does seem a bit in the slow side when writing a lot of data to it. It's working well as a backup drive for me.
1.0,Drive failed after 2 months. All 2 TB of data lost. Thanks Seagate for a quality product.
4.0,I like how this worked and protected my tablet...in fact it is the 2nd one I bought...its a decent product...1st one lasted about a year
5.0,Feels great and the program runs smooth
2.0,One just broke after a day of use. So don't think the quality of this product is very high and would not recommend it!
1.0,"FAIL.  Plugged it in, set up the switch, watched the blue light come on and flicker.  Wanted to use it as a network bridge and filesharing hub.  But... it doesn't work.  The advertised network came up briefly, then went away again.  Switched cables, switched outlets, switched everything.  There is no there there.  Just doesn't work :("
1.0,It's not waterproof!
4.0,"Comes as advertised, you get what you pay for, although the construction feels a bit on the flimsy side - so one should handle them with care, the audio quality and comfort is very good, I hardly feel them on. The mic is practical and works great once you get the proper updates from Logitech. I would fully recommend this as an affordable PC surround sound headset."
5.0,good
3.0,"I bought this card excited to expand the 16GB of storage that come with the phone.  However, this card had issues mounting when I would start the phone.  After some research, it looks like SanDisk had a large batch of bad cards.  If formatted as FAT32 the issue rarely occurred.  But when formatted as exFAT, like is ideal for mobile devices, it would happen every time the phone was reset.  Take caution with these cards.  The bad batch should be over, I have read, but if looking to use in a Samsung phone, maybe considering buying a different type of card, as this is the only brand I have seen with issues.  Other than that, it is a good card with great size."
2.0,"The SDHC card standard is valid up to a max capacity of 32GB. You risk losing some or all of your valuable data If you buy this card.<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />Be especially wary of cards with a stated capacity of 64GB or above marked as &#34;SDHC&#34; (not &#34;SDXC&#34;). The SD card association controls and licenses the SD card standards and they define &#34;SDHC&#34; up to a maximum capacity of 32GB. For larger capacity cards, only the &#34;SDXC&#34; standard is valid.<br /><br />Good 64GB SD cards are out there, but they will conform to the SDXC standard and will be clearly marked as such. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

2.0,Nice wose but quality no so best one! Better turtles beach
1.0,I only got this because amazon said its was it was the only I shouldn't buy with the  tablet I getting an it don't work.
5.0,such a good mic using it for my new you tube channel
1.0,The cables feel great. But one failed to charge anything right out of the box. The other two failed over the next three weeks.
5.0,"This was ordered as extra memory for my wif'e's tablet. Provides lots of extra space for storage, beyond the onboard RAM."
2.0,"The extra long cord is a plus but this inexpensive adaptor fails to charge my son's Hp touchscreen laptop's battery.  Powers the laptop fine, but fails to charge the battery.  Not recommended."
5.0,"The first couple of days, this product was kind of noisy...after that break end period, quiet as a mouse. Love it."
1.0,Will not charge Apples iPad or iPhone
3.0,"Decent wireless mouse, but the scroll &#34;surface&#34; is a bit annoying. It is a kind of track pad with haptic feedback (vibration), and it makes scrolling difficult. I would actually prefer a true scroll wheel. When reading thru documents I tend to use my laptop's trackpad instead, which somewhat takes away from the purpose of having a standalone mouse."
1.0,"Most of my reviews are positive.  This product failed (could not read on my device (a Galaxy S3) nor on my computer with 2 different readers) in less than 30 days.  The customer support is also unhelpful, as they would only replace the card after many questions, they would not provide a refund (I did not want a replacement of a card that failed so quickly).I would suggest buying a different card, it is not worth the hassle and lost data to save a couple of dollars with buying this one."
4.0,This does not lock in perfectly into a Surface 2. It locks in but you have to force it. Other than that it gives you about 59gb once installed.
3.0,"To start off with you probably shouldn't set your expecations to high in this sound speaker as it may not actually be what you expect.<br /><br />In my case i just wanted something simple which these speakers seem to do the job but they are not any better than the previous speakers i was using ( some cheap $10 sony ones) so i cannot with good sense advise these unless you want to save space.<br /><br />Speaking about space this is exactly why i bought them to take out the other speakers i had and mount this unit to the desktop monitor. I actually bought the one that came with the external power however it sound bar gets sufficient power from the monitor without the need of the external power so i never bothered using it.<br /><br />There is a light in the middle of this unit when you turn on the speaker this can either be a good or bad thing. For me its actually a bad feature since it bugs the heck out of me having to look at the light while i am using my monitor i had to get electrical tape to cover it because it was so distracting when i would browse on my dell monitor.<br /><br />The quality of the soundbar is low mediocre at best , it does go pretty loud for its size but the sound starts  breaking up more once you crank it really loud.<br /><br />If anything there is mostly intended for low usage and space saving , i occasionally have hooked it up as another audio streamer for a phone or mp3 using its external power however its isn't really convenient as its too large to carry around than a mini speaker."
4.0,"Like another reviewer wrote, it is just ok and The track pad is very low quality. Buy a mouse.<br />Otherwise, it's a nice little lightweight computer for the price.<br />I will be exchanging mine though, it has a default in the screen display that makes it look like someone keyed the screen"
3.0,"Great little card.  The only problem I have experienced may not even be related to the card, but Android OS itself.  I experience buffering/'hiccups'/pauses when watching a video if I also have my utorrent client in the background downloading.  I am not sure if this is limited to the card itself and possibly a faster write speed is needed, or it's the fault of the phone's OS.  However, I am confident that it's operating within spec.Card looks good too.. too bad it's in the case of my phone never to be seen."
3.0,"I've used this on two week-long vacations, carrying it every day. For the price, it's probably a good bag, though if you load it up, the thin leather doesn't inspire trust that it will last. I've noticed one thing about this that has greatly frustrated me more than anything else. There are just TOO many similar pockets that have you zipping and unzipping over and over to find what you're looking for. Along with that, it's awkward to access compartments, depending on which one of the many, while wearing it over one shoulder. You have to take it off. Some compartments have two zippers, some one. and the criss-crossing of straps on the side make it difficult to maneuver some zippers. It's just a frustrating bag for me."
5.0,"This works well with my Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II. It has a lot of storage space, good for all your videos, music, and pictures. It comes with an adapter so if you wanted you could use it in a spot for a regular SD card, but it really is meant for use in a voice or data recorder, a camcorder, or phone. It is class 10 so it handles recording and playback of HD quality video which is important as newer phones can record that way. Very good card"
4.0,Good don't use it must but seems to work as avertised
5.0,"Awesome, just awesome. Great speed also. I use this in a Nikon DSLR, taking 24MP pictures, and this thing rips though them like nothing. I haven't had any heat issues at all or data loss."
5.0,"Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for this card.Seriously, you spend all that money on a nice phone and it's like you're only using it at 1/4 or 1/3 of it's capability.Get this memory card and enjoy your phone how it's supposed to be run."
5.0,"I have purchased several Sandisk sd cards for its reliability and function. This is just one of the purchases and I will be ordering more. It works for my tablet, camera and computer. Love it !"
3.0,It is a sturdy case but hard to remove once on and hard to swipe text.
2.0,not enough storage for my macbook pro
1.0,"I returned it.......... Loved the color but didn't house the I pad well, not protective.."
3.0,"Has lasted about a year so far- It's still working for the moment, but starting to flake out unless the cord is jiggled.  I've had my laptop battery die several times now, because the power brick will just cut off randomly.<br /><br />The biggest thing about this for me is that this thing is completely unshielded.  No matter what power you plug it into- wall AC, battery backup, or otherwise, it will send harsh static/AC power fluctuating noises through your speakers.  This is not a 'ground loop' issue- the noise comes from the power brick itself.<br /><br />I use my laptop to record audio, so this is a deal-breaker for me.  If you are doing anything with audio on your laptop, I highly suggest spending the extra money on the ASUS original power brick.  That's what I'm about to do & keep this as a backup until it dies, which I'm expecting to happen soon."
3.0,"Strange cover, weird leather rubber combo, the old Keyboard model covers with the draw string and soft interior were way better. A piece of the rubber in the corner ripped off like in the first week and the outside scratches easy."
3.0,This sleeve fits just about any laptop - I had no trouble getting my Gateway with a 14&#34; screen to fit in it with room to spare.  I think I could also slide a pad of paper in too.  Neoprene should provide protection against light rain but I would not go so far as to say this is waterproof.  The external padding provides some protection against bumps and scratches but will not help much against really rough treatment.
4.0,"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk."
5.0,"Used this ram on my old HP media center computer. I was looking to use it for some basic functions and run a few programs for my work. Of course the computer was slow and would lag a lot. With the add ram, it's so much quickerIIno issues now. Couldn't be happier for the price"
3.0,"Problems with DVD, needs up grade did not expect. Sound  issues. Need more time with the lap top hopefully no more issues than already stated."
3.0,"I bought it because it was supposed to be delivered with a EU plug, but it did not. Product not as described.  Now I have to attach an adapter to the plug which is bothersome and sometimes does not connect well."
2.0,Very disappointed.  This power cord stopped working 3 days ago.  Unfortunately a waste of a few dollars.
1.0,"I got this product exactly 1 month and 3 days ago. Prior to today, it was working fine. Out of nowhere, my Micro SD card can't be read anymore. I've tried several phones, and 3 different laptops (both OSX and Windows 7), and it doesn't even show up anymore. Be weary of the product. You may end up with a lemon."
1.0,Worked for about a week and then quit. Glad I didn't pay much at all but it would have been nice to have an extra charger for my phone.
1.0,"UPDATE: I received the replacement today, and my 5Ghz problem is resolved, but now I have a different problem - when I select channel 11, the router doesn't transmit!  This creates a problem, because in order to get away from other wifi signals, I need to use channel 11.<br /><br />I monitored the router output using WiFi Analyzer, and when channel 11 is set, the carrier disappears. Set channel 10 or any other channel, and the transmitted carrier reappears. I also verified by attempting to connect when set to 11. No go. It connects on all other channels.<br /><br />So, I'm giving up on this Netgear model. It's going back to Amazon tomorrow. Two different failure modes on two different examples is not a good sign.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I suddenly found myself in the market for a new router after my TP-Link router rolled over and died after about a year (no surprise). I settled on this Netgear R6400, primarily because it seemed to have the best reviews of it's competitors.<br /><br />It has built in setup software that works really well, and it automatically detected that I had an external router, and that I probably wanted to operate in Access Point mode (which I did).  Setup proceeded without any issues, which hasn't always been the case with older routers/access points.<br /><br />So, I was now up and running, and the 2.4Ghz coverage was great. However, 5Ghz coverage was basically nonexistent. I could successfully connect when I was within about 6  feet of the router - any further and I couldn't connect.<br /><br />I tried moving the router to three completely different locations - same result.  I tried repositioning the (permanently attached) antennas. No change. I tried different 5Ghz channels. Some improvement, but not enough to allow consistent connects.<br /><br />So, I'm returning it for replacement. I'm hoping that I just got a defective unit. Thanks to Amazon's fantastic Returns policy and procedures, I'll know in two days when the replacement gets here.<br /><br />If possible, I'll update this review with the results for the replacement."
1.0,The front was like melted a bit and the buttons didn't work and I the thing for the dead didn't work ether
3.0,"This is a well designed bag and I have been very happy with it. My only complaint is that the dye from the leather rubbed off on my pants the first day I carried it using the shoulder strap - making it look like I was wearing very dirty pants. So I haven't used the shoulder strap sonce, which is a bit inconvenient and disappointing. Also glue is visible where the zipper meets the leather.<br /><br />All that aside, I really do like the setup of the bag and the leather feels well made. The laptop sleeve does not fit a realistically-sizes laptop, but I don't think any briefcases this size do. My 16&#34; laptop fits comfortably in the main pocket."
1.0,My batter died in about a months time. As the month went on the battery progressively held less and less charge until it no longer held a charge. So the laptop only worked with the charger plugged in. So I'm now buying a new battery. Would not recommend this or any knock-off brand charger. They probably aren't regulated and fry the battery.<br /><br />Laptop: Asus X53U model<br />Li-Ion Battery Pack A32-K53 (specs: 10.8V 5200mAh 56Wh.)
4.0,"Even the website ([...] had this card in the picture of what i'd be ordering. When i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes, and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one. Turns out android HATE class 10 cards and much more prefers Class 4 cards because of the way the OS accesses LOTS of files at once, and Class 4 timing is just better for their computations. Only the 1 star off because of my own expectations.Otherwise this is gonna make a great camera card, hopefully the pics take faster (it's certainly a size upgrade atleast!)."
2.0,Don't buy this product. It doesn't charge your phone all the time.
4.0,Really nice case for my surface.
1.0,Always get a busy signal.  Was forced to purchase another device for hot spot
1.0,The charger broke within a day
5.0,This micro SD with adapter works fine.  I have no complaints.  If there was one thing I would wish for is a little less packaging --- it was over packaged for something sent mail order.
4.0,"I updated my old computer because I was unable to play some of the newer games on the market. This was reasonably priced and gets the job done. It's not the newest and the best, but it does what I want. And you can't beat the price."
4.0,nice inexpensive functional part.
3.0,"The hard drive is separated into 2 separate drives, not 1 750-gb drive list most other computer. the keyboard is very nice, although it turns off very quickly if the computer receives no input. i'd give it a solid 20 seconds of light after you stop touching the computer before it turns off the keyboard lights. it is easy to press the home button during normal typing and going back to the beginning of a sentence, however the end button is placed on the &#34;1&#34; key on the numpad, and pressing Fn doesn't let you select end. you have to turn off num lock to use end, which ticks me off, especially since the Fn key works for the calculator, &#34;Enter&#34; and delete (period) keys. also, there are 2 insert and delete keys...why?? the normal delete(insert) key on the top of the keyboard, as well as the &#34;0&#34; and &#34;period&#34; keys functioning as insert and delete respectively. i have, in the month or so since i've received the laptop, had 3 driver failures, and 2 instances of the laptop not charging, and needing to be unplugged for about 5 minutes or so being being plugged back in the charge correctly, and 1 instance of not connecting to the internet, even though the icon showed the wireless bars as having 4 of the 5 filled showing a good signal, and when i went to the wireless center, it simply said &#34;no networks available&#34; without even giving the normal options of turning wifi on/off or airplane mode on/off. i had to restart the computer to fix the issue, which was a pain, as i was in the middle of class and needed the info yesterday. in addition, even though, since the moment i noticed the hard drives are separated into 2, with the OS being saved onto the C drive, i have installed all new programs solely on the D drive, the computer has exponentially slowed down, as if i had installed everything onto the OS drive. however, even with the slowdown in normal tasks, it still retains the approx 2 second startup and wakeup times.there is a slight bit of lagging on some of the higher end games with graphics on high (not max, or ultimate, just high) and despite what you may think when you see the wireless card advertised as having wireless n capability, it does not, in fact, connect to 5.0 Ghz networks, even though wireless b/g/n SHOULD be able to see and connect to them. overall, if you can afford it, go for $200 or $300 more expensive model, to actually get what you want, or pay less money for a cheaper model, because either way you won't get what you want :/<br /><br />unfortunately it's too late for me to return the laptop, and even if it wasn't, i need it for schoolwork, so i couldn't return it anyway, because i wouldn't get a new one on time for classes.<br /><br />oh yeah, one more thing, when using the touchpad for the mouse, it's kind of...different...than any other laptop touchpad i've ever used, so you'll have to get used to it.clicks are kinda weird, and when you right-click (or double finger tap) there is a slight lag before you can move the mouse again to select the option you wanted."
4.0,"I needed to direct light directly over where my laptop docking station sits.  This little device does that nicely. Nothing fancy, it comes on when the computer is powered up."
3.0,"The case fits the Ipad Air 2 great and works well with the auto wake and sleep function. I didn't think I cared about whether or not the interior was microfiber, but the matte rubber finish on the inside leaves marks on the screen. The marks are basically the fold lines of the cover. The marks are not damaging and can be wiped off, but when your screen is dim, those lines can be kind of annoying. I returned this one for the gray."
1.0,"I bought this product and the 1TB Samsung EVO 850 Pro. The PC only acknowledges &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; There wasn't even a Letter assigned to the SSD until I read how to manually do that. But the USB still acknowledges it as &#34;ASMT1051.&#34; I read a StarTech employee comment say USB 3.0 supplies only 1,500 mA in power and does not work with some 2.5&#34; SSD drives. The EVO 850 Pro requires 1.5A, which is 1,500mA. Perhaps this is why it doesn't work. Windows 10 is not compatible with the Samsung Magician software or the Samsung Data Recovery software to Clone your Hard Drive. So if you have Windows 10, stay FAR away from Samsung! It is simply unforgivable that Samsung would make a SSD that cannot be identified by Windows 10."
1.0,"Doesn't work - in fact, causes interference with our network. Instructions were almost indecipherable - online videos helped, but don't waste your money on this product."
5.0,Tested it by storing some apps and taking a few pics and videos.I am not techie enuf to run any specific tests.
4.0,Fit well no complaints.
5.0,"Great price and works great.  If you want more storage at a  reasonable price, I would highly recommend this product."
2.0,couldn't get it to work
4.0,It's bigger than I thought but it does the job.
4.0,Good disk
2.0,"I was going to deploy this on a job, but realized that it's overkill and not needed, plus the power and data wire doesn't fit it really well when you try and put them all together the way you want to. It's still in the junk box."
3.0,"Doesn't have a screen protector, a bit bulky, but it works for my 2.5yo daughter. She get's limited screen time so she's not carting it around too much and hasn't had a chance to really test the shock proof since we make her sit while using it."
5.0,It's A good reliable product that I can always rely upon. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a micro sd.
1.0,Not up to mark.sound quality is really bad
2.0,doesn't work will not copy any dvds period. always says not enough space!
5.0,"Excellent quality memory; good deal for the price! It functioned perfectly, good speed, and meets all my needs. I would definitely recommend for anyone using tablets. I am planning to buy another one shortly."
3.0,magnets damaged quickly
3.0,"Does not match Asus zenbook, too spacey"
5.0,"I love this card. It is fast...... and enough space to hold more than I will use. I can put movies on there with plenty of space for music, pictures, ect."
1.0,Bought a 3-pack and all the cords quit charging within a couple of weeks of purchase. They also get so hot I was concerned about a potential fire hazard. Not Apple certified either and phones stopped recognizing the cord.
4.0,"Purchased to add to the memory for my Windows 8.1 tablet (Dell Venue Pro) and it works like a charm!  Also, I shopped aroundand it was the best price I found!"
5.0,"I'm running a live Linux system off of this card right now, via a USB port.  Seems to have good read/write speeds and is durable."
5.0,"Works Great!  I was running out of room on my 32GB card on my Galaxy Note 3.  This solved my problems nicely!  Now I have enough space for movies, music and photos on my device!  I don't think I will be running out of space for a while!"
3.0,"It works fine with my galaxy note 8.0... it is hard to review now for performance, but the price is good... I think."
3.0,"I did not care for this case, I did not like all the flaps on the back that access the iPad 4 features. It was a heavy case and it did protect the iPad 4 if dropped but I found it hard to attach the screen protector and just did not like it. I bought a supcase that had a built in screen protector and was lighter weight and fit my tablet better."
4.0,"Purchased it for use on my Samsung Tab 2 as well as my Note 3.The msd card came with 3 possible formatting : NTFS / FAT /exFAT. The default is exFAT, and there seemed to be some comments saying that certain devices might not be able to read exFAT.Being the smart alec I am, i decided to format it to NTFS, assuming that my android devices will work with it. Tab2 was not able to read NTFS, and I had to reformat it back to FAT in order to get it work.Subsequently, I tried using those USB-SD card reader (those that looks like a tiny usb drive)and realised that apparently the SD card formatting is too new, and it simply will not register as 64GB, but can only read up to 32GB.Have not tried on Note 3 yet, but should work seeing that the technology is pretty on par."
4.0,Binding is fragile  I have broken 3.  Customer service  made good  with replacements each time
1.0,This case might be OK if you take out the screen protector. Then again you could probably find a cheaper one that doesn't come with one. When I installed the case it made the screen protector bubble out in the middle. Not only did this affect the touch but also made the images distorted if you looked at screen from any angle other than straight on. Plus it really seems to show finger prints and has bad glare.
4.0,It works well as a replacement power supply for my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.  It even came with a nice bag.
5.0,"I'm using this in a NOOK HD+ (Customized Android OS). I use it mostly for music, a few docs. It works as expected with no problems. I have several SanDisk MicroSD cards, but this is the only XC card. They have all performed as expected. I have been pleased with both his memory card, as well as the other SanDisk cards."
3.0,"Have been using it for a year now and its still in good condition, nothing (that I'm aware of) has torn and neither have the zippers gotten stuck or have broken. Even with a couple of notebooks and the 15.6 laptop, the straps help ease the load, but you will start to feel it weighing you down and hurting your shoulders after a while.  EDIT 12/29/2016: I bought this bag in November 15, 2014, and is now tearing at the straps. What I carried is still the same as above. Not sure if a life expectancy of 2 years for a backpack like this is normal, but I'm going to bring this from a 4 star to a 3 star."
3.0,"nice, but doesn't stay on good."
5.0,"I use this card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and have not had any issues with it at all. I have had other brand memory cards which have failed and become unreadable in the past, this however has accepted anything I throw at it. I use it to store all pictures that I take on the phone (currently 1,700+), music and videos. I have mp3's and a few movies on it and there is never any lag or random un-mounts. I highly recommend it."
5.0,"This 32GB microSDHC card replaces a 16GB card.  Ordering was easy, the price was good and the product arrived well packaged and fully functional."
1.0,the think did not work it was a piece of garbage.  The charger when you plunged into the wall did not work at all.  Bad purchase<br /><br />Richard Vallone
4.0,Just dropped right into the phone with no proble.  Disk works great and give me plenty of room for storage.
4.0,Fits my Fire perfectly  Wish it had a good elastic piece to hold my stylus
5.0,"This SDHC is fast. Great for cameras, the pictures take nothing to record and the next shot is quick and easy. I use it with Raspberry Pi, that needs fast media. Works perfectly."
3.0,After reading a ton of reviews for the Kids Kindle I decided to go for this one as it seems that many parents would have prefered to go this route. I am used to more user friendly tablets but this was on sale and decided to give it a go. My son is utterly disinterested and so am I. Using this definitely takes some getting used to.
2.0,"I was excited about this when I ordered it since reviews said the Mac didn't need a separately installed driver.  Clearly they didn't do anything to test it since Yosemite came out about a year ago.  I thought perhaps the info hadn't been updated.  The unit regularly stops functioning and is hot.  A restart will get it working again.  However, if you're copying files over your network and it locks up, you'll have to discard the partially copied items and start over or nearly over.<br />I contacted Linksys and they said they hadn't tested it with Yosemite.  I asked why since it came out almost a year ago, and got no response.  The person then suggested I change the MTU value to below 1500 for the whole network.  I'll give it a try, but that's a workaround not a solution.<br />Use this ONLY if you occasionally have to wire up for something.  Don't use it for your primary network connection."
3.0,Expensive... but it does the job.  Only complain is that it doesnt lock.  Could be easy to loose.
4.0,"I bought these in hopes to replace my standard Sandisk 64gb models for quickness.  I'm not saying they are lightning fast, but they are definitely faster than the standard version.  I bought one for each of my phones and my tablets,  They work great.  When the 128gb is available, I will try the faster version of those also."
3.0,Instructions are there but vague. I will try the removable ones.
2.0,Very little memory.
1.0,The devise works great its the connection cable thats giving problems. if you mowe the laptop or the just think about moving the ssd disconnects and now you have to reconnect. also in the beginning it would nor recognize the devise and I would have to re install it few times. now using it for few months. some new developments. my laptop doesnt regognise it and it has to be reinstalled almost every time I do not have administrative rights to my laptop so it is a PAIN and if I'm out of the country it becomes useless.
5.0,It's worked great with my Galaxy S4 cell phone. Videos and photos taken with the phone automatically get stored to the memory card after it was installed as do may apps.  No issues.
5.0,I have this sd card for awhile now and I would have to say its awesome. The service was great. The product got to me at a reasonable time. My overall experience is 10/10. Thanks.
4.0,"I just pre-ordered it and can't wait to get my hands on it! Really the only reason why I bought this is because how it looks and I needed a gaming mouse.<br />For anyone wondering, Corsair Scimitar will be available 10/22/2015 (according to Newegg.com)<br />I actually like the yellow accent on this mouse, and its a bit disappointing that there isn't a couple color variation. If Corsair came out with a different color scheme I probably would look into it. (black and white, or red and black)<br />Also, because of the yellow accent, I don't know why this mouse is rgb, any other color than white or yellow will have a color clash."
3.0,"Bought it for my old Mac laptop. After connecting to the wifi network, the usb adapter is getting hot. The internet connection speed is very slow compared to the wireless card came with the laptop."
5.0,Bought this for use in my dash camera upgrade.Working very well and faster than the 4 GB card that came with the camera.  Also will work in my other digital cameras.
3.0,"The product arrived on time, well packaged.  The unit is nice but previous reviews are correct. The light is REALLY hard to get out.  Resorted to getting pen out to get the light to pop out."
3.0,"I think it's okay.  I couldn't get my device to talk to the computer, but it might be my driver.  Not sure."
4.0,What can I say - its a memory card. It remembers what its supposed to. At least it remembers as well or better than I do.Only problem I have with these Micro SD cards is - they're so small they're easy to lose. If these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something.
3.0,Bought this for someone who didn't know how to use a device. But they use it all the time!
4.0,"Purchase this for my asus tablet, read and write times are excellent, no problems so far.  came with case and adapter.  good price."
2.0,"waste of money ,its not working for me ,anyone I don't know,its a cheap product .don't buy it"
4.0,Does its job.
3.0,its okay i highly recommend a new battery and a new graphics card the battery will have shot outs and i'm not the only one that has these problems so the min i got the computer i changed the battery for it didint even bother with the battery
5.0,"Set up was a breeze. Used it as a range extender to get a better signal for streaming from my blue-ray player. I had nothing but problems trying to stream anything for many months until I learned of this product. I set it up in my living room and voila, no more problems!! It works with my xfinity wireless gateway router. At first set up, I was still having some problems streaming, but went on You Tube to see if I overlooked something, because there were so many good reviews, I thought something is not right here. What I overlooked was that after easy set up, I needed to go to my settings in the blue-ray player and connect with the securifi almond instead of leaving it connected to my home network. O.K. I'm not the most tech savvy person, but now it works great!! Love it! I can even play my music files from my computer on my t.v. now which I couldn't do before, even on those days when it did stream. Would highly recommend!"
3.0,"if you need a basic keyboard, this is the one! NO 2nd function.  you got what you paid for, but if you stretch a little more of your budget....you will get a better 2nd function keyboard."
5.0,Great product as promised. Slipped right into my Samsung Galaxy S4 with no issues and I like the adapter they provided in case I want to load data from my laptop directly into the card. I have not done any serious benchmarking around how media performs running off of the card vs. on-board memory but I have not noticed any difference.
3.0,"Not the most nicest one but for the price, I can said anything bad. I found an issue to install the SD and Graphics Card GTX 960. I have removed the plastic cover where the SD goes in order to keep wires pressing against the card. The 2 fans with lights by the side was a great idea but there are so many opens that there is not vacuum inside the case."
4.0,"If you are looking for a fist time starter game machine this is a very good machine, It also it works as your home computer as well. So Far my wife is getting used to it .These CYBERTRON  computers vary in degrees of  speed and accessories. I like this one&#62;7.1 Audio as well."
1.0,Fjxx
3.0,Pretty good.
5.0,Works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - no need to format (although I did) - recognized as soon as it was popped in 59.47GB usable.Arrived really fast and nicely packaged.  I would order again.
5.0,Bought this to add memory to my phone.  No problems installing and it works great.  Don't know if I could ask for anything more.
5.0,"I recently upgraded from a nearly three-year-old HTC Windows Phone to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and decided to give it a huge memory boost. This card filled the bill perfectly. Add a good file manager to your App collection so you can use it effectively. Recommended.As an aside, I would have upgraded to another Windows Phone if WP8 permitted number blocking for nuisance callers. But it doesn't, so they lost me to Android."
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
2.0,Very unhappy about not being able to order without ads and 16gb in the colors of my choice also the parental controls are a joke! You can't even lock the kids out of the settings! Really? It still pops up with store suggestions even though they can't 'buy' them. I am really disappointed. (& we bought 3!)
3.0,It's OK a bit of problem to put on. Left some bubbles. For the most part it gets the job done.
2.0,One stopped working after a couple of days.
4.0,"Is very stable and when i use this product in my samsung galaxy 7, sometimes the tablet don't recongnize the memory but the problem is maybe the tablet not the memory i think"
5.0,"Fits well, looks great, and works perfectly"
4.0,Once I plugged it in to charge the battery for a full day it worked fine.  It's not very accurate though.  The time drifts a few seconds per day.
5.0,"I didn't realize what small memory I had on my old phone T-mobile My Touch 3G Slide! I mean the thing was so slow and not accepting downloading stuff anymore! I figured later than the memory might be small. Sure it was! I looked up for a SanDisk memory card on Amazon and ordered one! Was surprised it was much cheaper than I had seen in a store! Installed it in my phone, worked like a champ! I can still use my phone for different downloads with that much memory!"
3.0,it does not fit fully with the Otterbox Defender / mini Ipad. I have to make sure that the mini Ipad case is in a perfect center otherwise during the action will fall down...
2.0,The fans do not run consistently and my laptop is as hot (perhaps even hotter) than when I don't use the &#34;cooling&#34; pad.
1.0,Battery failed.  Bought new battery.  Battery failed.  System would not charge battery.  Took 32 days to find this out.  Cannot return after 30 days.  Computer shop wants to charge me $300 for repairs.
5.0,very affordable memory with a lot of storage this was an excellent purchase that was worth it thank every one
3.0,The range is short. Won't work well for 5ft distance
5.0,works great for all the different needs we have
2.0,"When I first received these cables I was impressed by the build quality and the beauty in the design, but after using them for a week I've realized they charge realllllllllllly slowly, like way slower than my lg cable that came with my lg g3. I wish I could love them, but :/ it takes like 5 hours to charge my phone with these cables. :C"
2.0,"I loved how the keys are laid out nicely and it had the office style Enter key (not that fat reverse L type enter key) but I found it to be shoddily made as it easily flexes with the slightest amount of pressure and I have naturally acidic skin so no keyboard stands up to my typing (no, I have clean hands not gunky ones) but this keyboard's letters started to wear off in a month, or two, and after 10 months I have no A, and the S is almost gone and E is next to go then C and my M is starting to go.<br /><br />I thought from Logitech I would get better but that was the old Logitech not this new garbage they have been churning out for the last 6 or so years.  Now I am on here looking for a new keyboard so I would have to say I wasted my money but never again a Logitech as I know many who have had a ton of minor to major issues with the new Logitech stuff and this keyboard for me taught me to just stay away.  Probably rebadged Chinese garbage now."
4.0,"I've gotten four of these for both of my Nikon D7000's and have had little bit of an issue with the adapter cards being out of spec and sticking in the Nikon Camera SD Slots, and one of my card readers. Sure enough, i sanded one down carefully and it fit perfectly.Performance wise, these things scream over regular Class 10 or Class 6 cards and perform nearly excellent. I cant complain other than I wish they were faster, but I'm not getting that for a while at $23 per card."
4.0,no complaints
5.0,great replacement battery. Works like a charm for now.
3.0,MEH
4.0,"Well not much to say...its a good mmc and its fast enough and that's about all you can ask for, using for more storage on my tablet.Update: stopped working after a while, computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour I could not fix, it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters I used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn't even read because of the error. It stopped working after amazons very short return policy so I was out of luck with them, luckily SanDisk has a very long (10-lifetime) for its ultra brands, even though it was a hassle and all through email only I got a replacement and that's why I only took one star off"
5.0,Even at a higher price this case would be a very good buy. It's large enough so that the Surface slides in and out easily.
1.0,"Good:<br />-- Backlighting is great.<br />-- USB response faster than a wireless (I'd suggest a Keyscrambler too).<br />Bad:<br />--  It suddenly quit after just six months.<br />-- The painted keys quickly faded into illegibility.<br />-- Clunky, sticky keys make typing more sloppy and imprecise."
4.0,"Alot of storage for a great price. Only one probkem: since I installed this card into my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, about once a month or so, when I turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of &#34;boot loop&#34; and hangs on the AT&T logo screen. My phone is stock, and I have altered the software in no way. Granted, I cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem, but if I remove it and then boot the phone, it works properly. I love SanDisk products, and I will definitely continue to buy them. Just a word of warning."
1.0,Got this product and it was fine until it just stopped working...The last one I had that came with my DROID X on release day worked for the whole time since I got it without a hitch...I get this one and it's dead in less than 60 days...I don't know if I got a lemon myself or the whole supply is bad or faulty... All I have to say is I am very displeased!
5.0,This sd card was exactly what we were looking for. The last one we purchased got deleted and unformatted by the phone so we decided to replace it. This is a great price and came with the adapter too.
4.0,"Plug 'n Play ready on OpenElec via a RPi2, so no complaints of the actual driver support or build quality on opening (actually it was also fully packaged which is a bit shocking with my history of buying (admittedly cheap) usb bluetooth adapters online). It is a little pricey compared to what I'm used to, but will update to fivestar in some months if the few extra bucks proves themself to mean it will hold up better (than the aforementioned  cheapies) as well."
1.0,Doesn't quite fit iPad Air 2 right.  Area for home button should be a little bigger. Can't get the iPad centered just right.
4.0,The mp5 player looks good! I hope i like it and it works for me! I would hate to have to return it.
5.0,Love it! I actually love it so much that I've now purchased 2 additional ones as gifts. Great little speaker. Takes 10 seconds to set up and lasts for a long time!
2.0,"It WILL NOT fit the Fitbit Charge.  You can get it halfway in and as long as it isn't budged or if a slight breeze doesn't blow by, it MAY charge it for a bit."
5.0,Got this 32GB card for my Droid Razr Maxx HD.  It was recognized by the phone and I have had no troubles with it. Shipping was only a couple of days.
1.0,"Despite being gentle with my laptop, this case started cracking within a week or two. At first it was just small pieces breaking, and after 2-3 weeks huge parts were breaking off to the point where the case no longer stayed on the laptop. Absolutely terrible product."
1.0,"Because the cable is flat it gets kinks in it. Does not let enough power through to charge my phone at the correct rate, so complete charge ups are long. The biggest problem are the connections on the mini usb end that houlds it in my phone.  They wore down in a few weeks. The bulb lights up my room at night, so I had to put my phone under the bed. I say had because I threw it out because it kept slipping outof my phone."
4.0,Awesome for reading. Only  problem although you can read PDFs it's not possible to download this kind of file.
2.0,"Rugged durable case, but the cover corners break off with normal use.  An attempt to get a replacement was a joke.  I sent six pictures from various angles clearly showing the defect, and kept getting jerked around.  I finally gave up bought another case from another company.  It's really too bad that this company would rather lose a customer than replace a $2 plastic part"
4.0,life saver.  found a bunch of photos that were save to 3.5&#34; floppy disk at time of possessing.  Now I can put them on my computer and it work great.
4.0,its very big for my spigen case so i had to shave some of the plastic
3.0,"Not as well lit as I would like.  Will continue to use my Fire HD when at home, and take the glare free to the car wash, salon, etc."
2.0,"First I should say that this backpack is extremely padded, so it will protect the laptop from just about anything.<br />I wanted to love it because of its sternum strap, buckle strap in the front which can hold a lunch cooler, and awesome ergonomic design which makes you feel like you're not carrying any weight, but it's useless for us because the padding makes the usable space way too small. My son couldn't fit his 1&#34; ring looseleaf binder in the laptop section (it fit perfectly in other laptop backpacks). I'm not talking about the dedicated sleeve, but rather the entire zippered back compartment. You have to force it. It did fit in the second main compartment closer to the front of the backpack, but left no room for anything else besides for maybe 2 thin notebooks.<br />The pocket on the bottom means that the backpack falls forward even when full of books. Most others can balance when full, or at least can be made to lean backwards onto something. This one can't. The main compartment at the back doesn't open wide and isn't easily accessible. The one toward the front opens wide, but the curve of the zipper forces you to pause and reposition your hand like 3-4 times along the path and it feels like it's stuck, even though it isn't. It's not one smooth gliding motion.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the Case Logic backpack I have for myself: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002J9HBSE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_2&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER and thought I'd try Case Logic for my son, but while the VNB-217 is very roomy without looking bulky, well padded, and every compartment is easily accessible, the Griffith Park doesn't offer any of that, besides padding."
5.0,"What can I say about a memory card?  I purchased it to increase the memory in my phone, it fits as it should, and works as it should."
1.0,Did not fit my lap top as described. Seller did refund my money very quickly.
2.0,"Still will continue to use the Jot pro, seems that the iPad isn't ready for a Bluetooth stylus, it is just not reliable enough yet. experienced alot of skipping issues."
5.0,Ordered this to go with the tablet I ordered for my fiance. It works well and she loves her tablet!
3.0,"I don't know what to say...old one broke...this one, great price, great delivery, and my son says it is more powerful than my old one, but I noticed no difference... it WORKS,,, that...makes me h a pony...period"
3.0,"Had a great selection of colors and designs, but started to fall apart after a while. After using it for about 3 months, half of the keys on the keyboard stopped working, and the case started to peel away. It was great for the first few months but then fell apart. I had to buy a new case after about 9 months of use on the case, and about 4 months of use on the keyboard,"
1.0,Does not work in my 10.1 tablet. Does not work in my new FIRE. Does not work in a card reader. It does not work! Never did. Found out too late to return the POS.
3.0,"I bought three of these, 2 of them work, one doesn't. The ones that work are fine."
3.0,It is way to heavy and bulky.  I blame myself because I didn't research enough.
5.0,"It's a Micro SD card, it's 128 GB (which is amazing), and that's just about all I can say...  I do wish it was faster, because I've put 20-40GB virtual machine files on it and it took quite a while for them to copy.  I guess I'm used to SSD speeds.  But anyway, it adds a much-needed additional storage to my tablet."
1.0,DO NOT BUY!  The disk is locked and you have to jump through dozens of hoops and call tech support to unlock it!  All of these favorable reviews are false!  You can't use the drive!  It's locked!  Amazon is selling you defective drives!
2.0,Worked the first time with my dvi screen but now doesnt detect it or allow my screen to be used with my laptop
4.0,Great Produce!
4.0,Usually people say they break within a day or 2.  (Mine haven't yet!) and its a great part!
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this product, but when I received it, it was in really bad shape. the box was dented and sad looking. I dont know if it left the factory then, but it was a pretty sad birthday gift. When I opened it, it looked squished and damaged, but there was no particular flaws with the monitor. Looking normal, I tried to set it up, but it did not turn on. It was probably a defunct monitor. I will try and get a replacement, and from there, I will post another review, but until then, I will leave this review as a 2 star Monitor."
4.0,Bargain priced but quite satisfactory compared to to others I've purchased at considerably higher prices. Worked right from the get-go.
3.0,"Not sure if it's my laptop's power port or the charger, but it needs re adjusting ALL the time, it's actually very tedious. If I could get another and it works perfectly I'll change my review to 5 stars. The length on the cord is amazing however, never have to worry about getting to an outlet."
1.0,"Broke after  2 weeks.....I will go back to Samsung HD cards... This was a waste of time and money. Actually, I should ask for a refund"
1.0,"I've had the monitor for over a month now (unfortunately past the return policy time) and I have to say I hate it. During the first two weeks I owned it, it would occasionally flicker off when using it. It was annoying, but only happened once every few hours so it didn't stop me from being able to do work. I tried changing hdmi cables and computer settings to see if it was just going off from either of those - but the problem persisted.<br /><br />Weeks later, the monitor flickers off every fifteen minutes or so - making it impossible to work on. If at all possible, buy a different monitor than this one. And if your monitor has even the slightest problem out of the box, return it instantly - don't wait like I did. Now I'm stuck with this unusable thing."
1.0,"Does not work with the Mac like advertised.  There are drivers on the Cable Matters website, but despite many tries, I cannot get this to work on a Mac with OS X Yosemite."
1.0,Broken within hours.
1.0,1080p 30fps or 720p 30fps or 24fps using the nokia camera app or regular app doesn't work. well it does but unless you want to see stuttering every 6-7 seconds. it freezes up constantly. very glitchy because its slow. got a 9mbs write 44.9mbs read on mine.
4.0,"Using the card for videos and music, have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media!"
5.0,Just what I needed working on my laptop and it saves me money on the electric bill by turning down the A/C a little.
4.0,Good quality FLAT ethernet cable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good quality wire and connectors<br />-Doesn't easily tangle<br /><br />Cons:<br />-none so far
5.0,"not much to say other than plug and play, good quality and fits a lot of video ...good good good"
1.0,Worked for 1 week before the EU adapter stopped working
1.0,"I would not recommend this card if your looking for REAL class 10 write speeds. The most I could get is 9mb/s from this card but for the most part it was about 7-8mb/s. I even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements. I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10. Too bad I read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but I will be sending this one back."
2.0,"It was damaged, I was ignored."
5.0,when i got it it was broken so i had to send it back... they sent me a new one immediately. i am so happy  cause my phone's internal capacity is 2 gigs... that's not much... -_-
2.0,It would of been perfect if it held the ipad tightly. It gets loose a minute after you put it in. Just slides out of it. Great Idea if they could fixed the grip.
1.0,"I bought a zenbook ux303LN notebook 4 months ago. The first laptop that I received could not be turned on at all. I returned the laptop for a new one. 4 months after I use the laptop, I suddenly noticed that the hinge is broken, and it makes a cracking sound. I had to send the laptop back to asus to be repaired for at least 3 weeks. I could not do anything now, since I have to use my laptop everyday. I am also afraid that after my warranty is gone (12 months), my laptop would be useless. I am really disappointed with ASUS"
5.0,"What can I say.  I got this at a one day sale only on Amazon and wow this things worked smoothly. No errors, no formatting needed. I just popped it into my GSIII and it worked like a charm"
2.0,No lighted cover/case available.  Small to hold and if your finger slips the slightest the page changes or the font changes or it sets off the dictionary. ...touchscreen is very sensitive.<br />Not an easily handled device at all.<br />It reads fine. About as good as any other and the battery life is as expected.<br />Overall I am disappointed.<br />Page turner tabs should be an option.  And someplace to actually hold it (more than the 1/2 inch provided)
1.0,Broke down really quick :(not worth it :(
2.0,beware memory speed is 10700 instead of 14900
5.0,"This Micro SD card is solid and has a great performance. It's really a fast reading SD Card, I would say 4 times faster than any previous cards I had in the past. Once I placed the card in my phone, and I turned it on, you could see the difference. Every application I have in my cell phone that is in my SD card, works really flawlessly. A great product, very solid performance."
2.0,"Didn't work for me...I'm extremely careful with this sort of project but I could never get the multiple, smart bubbles out. I cleaned the screen very careful before appling the film but to no avail. The slight loss of detail clarify wasn't a problem but the bubbles drove me nuts. Both screen protectors now reside in the rubbish bin. The shipping was excellent and the online instructions are good. I wish this product had worked but it did not. I hesitate to recommend."
2.0,on the corner it says Mosiso in ugly letters. It makes it seam cheap. Was excited about this purchase and now I don't think I'll ever use it.
2.0,"I got this computer on the assumed 4 hour battery life on average use. After all they advertise 5 1/2, well try again not even 3 hours while just web browsing. Other than that the computer is great, If you don't plan on taking this computer to school or something like that you might be good. Very disappointing."
4.0,Good purchase!
3.0,Charges devices much slower than shorter cables and Apple cables.
4.0,"I ordered this to speed up reprogramming BIOS on some flash parts.  I was using a Bus Pirate and it was taking about 25 minutes to reprogram each part.  With this each part programs in 2 minutes which is much better. The reason this only gets 3 stars is because the drivers included with it for 64bit windows aren't signed, this means you have to jump through a lot of hoops if you want to use this on a 64 bit machine.  I cheated since i have access to a real signing certificate through my work.  I had to modify the .inf file but eventually I was able to sign the drivers and get it working on my 64 bit Win 8.1 machine.  Update: Global Cyber Mart responded quickly to my request for signed 64 bit drivers and pointed out that the item says 32 bit.  So I've increased the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I've suggested they add a bullet item stating specifically that it is NOT supported for win 7/8/8.1 64 bit because I think the way they indicated 32 bit only support wasn't very obvious.  Pros: - Fast.  8MB part in 2 minutes - Cheap - Included software is easy to use.  Cons: - No signed 64 bit driver.  Beware Windows 64 bit users!"
1.0,I've had two of these cards so far. Neither of them were recognized by Mac or PC. I am able to use it but only if I leave it in the Gopro camera and hook up the Gopro to the Mac via USB. It will not work as a normal SD card and needs to be used with the camera. I can not recomend this card at all. I had the first card replaced because it was defective. Now the second card is defective also. I don't have the time to play around with another return so I will just not ever buy Sandisk again.
2.0,tinny weak sound
3.0,I'm kinda bummed that you have to jump through hoops in order to get Google Play games when it should already be compatible because it is an Anroid
2.0,"Netgear needs to send the engineer who designed the case of this product back to kindergarten. As others have said, this product will block both outlets of a standard Duplex outlet, leaving the &#34;extra outlet&#34; as the only available outlet.  If the engineers at Nutgear had moved the outlet and plug on this product 1/2 inch closer to the end of the case, the other outlet in a duplex receptacle would be usable."
2.0,"The product seems to be working, however, after providing more barcodes than they requested, since they were not clear which ones they wanted, my refund application was denied.  If they are going to play games with the rebate, then why offer it at all?  I'm returning the product and taking my business elsewhere."
5.0,"Don't get ripped off buying the same card direct from GoPro, buy it here for less; then you can use the money you saved to buy an extra battery since the Hero 3 battery life sucks.I have a few of these in the Hero 3 Black Edition and it works great on all recording formats and speeds, even the highest resolution ones that require full use of the card's 10 MB/sec rating.  They're very fast to copy files off of into the computer as well.  I haven't benchmarked them because other reviews already have that information, but they're certainly much faster than the old class 4 cards I use for my Hero 2 cameras.I would recommend formatting upon arrival; I did have one initial issue with one of these which formatting resolved.  It's worked fine since, with numerous uses, so I think it was just a missed QC check at the factory.  It hasn't had the heat issue others have mentioned with regard to the few defective ones people have received and has worked flawlessly since so I'm not worried about it at this point."
3.0,I received that chargers last week and they charge my devices fine. The thing is that I was expecting that they would be able to connect to my laptop but I was wrong.
2.0,"I suppose you get what you pay for - latch that gives item a stand broke first day, lol<br />The rest is good for protecting though"
2.0,Sadly Died after 7 months of use.<br />It did a great job when it was functional.<br />Time to try out the 1 year warranty.
4.0,"I have this in my Galaxy S 3 and it works great, I've had no problems with it. Highly recommend."
1.0,"Looks cool, but sounds hallow. The sub adds no true bass. I purchased a Logitech x220 in 2004 and they just stopped working a month ago. Still the best computer speakers I've ever heard. Unfortunately these were a poor replacement."
4.0,"Not a lot to say about it, it's storage.  I haven't done any speed tests or anything but it definitely works in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I don't see any performance issues watching videos files stored on it."
1.0,Does NOT fit with iPhone 6 life proof case as advertised.  I bought these specifically because it said it would.  This is an unfortunate lapse in Amazon's quality control.  Notice on the picture where the red charger neck is larger than the factory neck and won't pass through the charging port in the life proof case
1.0,"I bought 2 of those SanDisk 32 GB microSD , used them on my Galaxy Note and Galaxy S4First one , my phone started saying it was removed , then recognize it again :) then diedI thought it's just a luck , plugged in the 2nd one :) stayed for about 2 months and died suddenly ! and lost everythingnever buying from SanDisk again .. ever"
1.0,THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR WILL NOT FIT!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
2.0,"Ordered two drives, one died on first use, sent it back.  With the second one I can hear what sounds like either the head bouncing or a bad spindle bearing every time it spins up/down.  I don't think it will last long but I use it as a tertiary backup drive so I don't really care.  However, I wouldn't trust this as a primary or even secondary drive and can't recommend it in general."
3.0,It's OK.  The earplug does not work.  Neither have I been able to connect it to an HDMI device.  It turns on in no time.
3.0,"Some cables are too short to do cable management espically with video card installed. I have problem rerouting the cable across the mother board. So its hard to make the cables clean but I do understand for that because of the price. Afterall, it does the job for the price."
3.0,Looks fine.
3.0,"It's a nice rubber case, but the stand is hard to fold, when the kids are watching videos."
1.0,"I purchased the refurbish Lynksys E2500, and it continuously drops my WiFi speed to a crawl. I have since ordered a replacement from another brand and experience no more problems with connectivity."
4.0,"I bought two of these shell cases: the green & the red. Items arrived quickly (in 5 days). The covers snapped on in seconds & fit perfectly. The colors were a little bit off from the seller's pictures. The green is more like lime green & the red, as one reviewer said, is more of an orangey red. Not that big of a deal. Quality is okay.

2.0,"stopped being compatible with my macbook, i think after an update :["
2.0,"I purchased this cooling stand because it has a similar design to one I previously owned, which I had a great experience with. This one, however, is not so good. I'm sure it cools well enough, but those supports on the front are awful. Cheap plastic, with a thin piece of super-low quality rubber, adhered with equally low-quality glue (which is already starting to wear off on mine). And it's not going to matter how you position the sliding supports; your arm will always rest on one of the square edges, and be uncomfortable the entire time you need to type."
5.0,It seems to have helped my video streaming problem
3.0,"I was really excited when this came out I have a Mac Air and a lot of music and film on it so the ability to stick this in my MiniDrive was great, it was that or buy a 128GB MiniDrive Air which is like $30 more that this and I already had a MiniDrive.  Problem is its not very fast, not fast enough, my girlfriend has a new 128GB MiniDrive and it runs way faster than this in my old adapter and new sandisk 128.  Its great though 128gb in this little chip glad its out cause now its just a matter of time before they make it better.Thanks"
3.0,no good
4.0,It took me forever to break down and give up the &#34;paperback&#34; habit but I now love my Kindle!! It is so easy and having the dictionary feature right there is fabulous. I don't have to write down the word and look it up later.  The book I'm reading now is by a British author and so many of the words and phrases are particular to England.  There was only one word that was &#34;not found&#34; so far... I recommend it.
4.0,I like it it is a little slow. I
4.0,"The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn't have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I've ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident."
1.0,"I purchased this for my gopro hero 3 and it worked ok for a while, then suddenly the camera would only record about 10 seconds at a time.  After reading some forums online, I was prompted to swap this Sandisk out for a Samsung card.  All of my problems went away!  I still use this card for random storage, but I won't use it in a camera again."
2.0,"The choice between buying a Kindle e-reader versus Kindle Fire is very confusing. The book reading function is splendid, but the browser on the paperwhite e-reader is &#34;experimental&#34; and fails to load digital newspapers such as Washington Post or New York Times. This forces e-reader users who already subscribes to analog or digital versions of these papers to buy additional subscriptions from Amazon to reformat same content specially for the Kindle. I'm not going to pay for the same content twice. If I knew newspaper reading was going to be problematic, I wouldn't have bothered with the 3G version. I've now cancelled my NYT subscription and replaced it with the Kindle app, and cancelled my trial WashPost Kindle app and am content to read my Post on old-fashioned newsprint. There are no easy choices."
2.0,Sound system not that great as described.  Screen images average.  I like my 11 inch dell venue tablet better
3.0,"I didn't format the card 1st and it cost me my video. Don't do what I did; format the card then use it (Windows PC) I'm not sure if you have to format 1st when using MAC. I used a PNY SDHC 16gb card and it did just as good as the SanDisk and it cost about $15 less, I think that's the better way to go, you're getting the same results just not as long of video time."
2.0,it didnt work that well for me.  wouldnt work on a mouse pad.
4.0,"Holds lots of video memory. Small, compact and convenience for travel. Due to the small size need to remember where you place it."
3.0,"The hard drive comes sealed on an anti-static bag held by special suspensor so the packaging is great. Something interesting I found is that though the drive itself says it is 1TB (LBA 1.953,525 168Sectors), it says as well at the label that the capacity is of 8455 MB (CYL16383, H16, S63)"
5.0,I travel from FL to CA every other week and usually have 4 or 5 devices with me.  Logging them into the hotel wi-fi individually is too much trouble.  This eliminates that problem by allowing me to log in one device and all the rest work automatically.
4.0,Fit is great.  I saw some reviews that had problems with the Raspberry 2.  It looks like that has been taken care of with the new version of this box.  The only problem was that to mount the camera in the top of the lid the camera ribbon cable has to be twisted for the camera to be oriented properly for the lens to see through the hole in the Pi logo. If the logo was turned over the cable would not have to be twisted.  I choose to cut away a little of the logo plastic so the cable didn't twist.
5.0,Prices on memory go down all the time. This was a good sale price when purchased. SanDisk has always worked flawlessly for me.
4.0,good product
5.0,Shipping time was quick and the quality of the product appears great.  Have used it to assist me with undercover work where I needed to dock my terminal into a unmarked vehicle.  No problems noted and provided a constant power supply to my terminal.  Would get another if needed.
5.0,"The keyboard, which I am typing on at this very second is very quiet, but still has the audible click that I enjoy so much from mechanical keyboards, only toned down. It's nice for not waking up my roommate early in the morning. For the cost, the keyboard is definitely worth it. The only thing I disliked about the keyboard at first was that the space bar was different from my last keyboard and required a bit more force for the keyboard to register the hit, I adapted to the difference in about a week or so and I absolutely love this keyboard. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a very high quality keyboard (I had a 100$ mechanical keyboard before this one that is on par with this one) without paying a ridiculous amount of money.<br /><br />As an added note, while I have not spilled anything on my keyboard as of yet, the added benefit of having the drainage holes is very nice."
2.0,under powered and just died last month after about a year of operation antmining.  i replaced it with another brand that has a better power supply I will not buy another of these units
1.0,"This is definitely a fast boot drive.  My problem is that my M.2 died after less than 3 months of use.  This is the shortest time frame I have ever had a drive break before.  Obviously, this is a sample of one.  ymmv<br /><br />Please be warned, these drives run hot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hhdWwvh5kI"
2.0,"When it works, it works well. It's terribly frustrating when it doesn't work, and that happens way too much for my preferences."
2.0,I am not sure what happened to these cards but I have owned several and they stop working quickly.  I sent a message to SanDisk and never heard back.  Very disappointing!
5.0,Great battery.  Lasts about 3 hours.
3.0,Doesnt work the best with windows 10 I have had a few issues but it seems to work very very well.
4.0,Its ok. Works fine but its ripping in the usually place near micro usb port. You get what you pay for but it still works so no complaints. Going on several months now and I do not have any problem with any of them that I bought (bought several) on how its functioning.
5.0,"Excellent, quality item."
2.0,It worked one day then not at all on another; still does not work
1.0,"DO NOT BUY, First try and POWER SUPPLY ARCED and SMOKED and almost on FIRE, my power strip saved the day. DO NOT BUY"
3.0,I was searching for a wireless modem / router and this came up high on the results. Unfortunately it is not wireless and it's not a router. I was able to make it work for me by buying a wireless router to go with it. So far it's working fine.
4.0,"I've had this two years and it's started to make a little noise now and then, but I just lift the laptop a tiny bit and bounce it down. That usually stops it. I'll be buying a new one, and it will be this one."
2.0,key board works perfect I really loved it but the case has really weak corners and it cracked in a week.
2.0,"The product description was confusing, didn't realize I was only getting a cover for the Xbox"
5.0,I have a MacBook Air and was curious if could put a TimeMachine backup on an SD Card.  For the experiment picked the SanDisk because:I've had great luck with their cards in the pastUsing a microSD gives me the most options with changing tech going forwardAmazon had it for $64 while it was $99 at Best Buy.Well guess what it works great!.
2.0,Scratched all on back of panel screen fine
5.0,"I have Only Filled this one time, and that was over 140 pictures @1080, and 4 videos to boot...This Holds Plenty of Pictures"
1.0,"We tried two of these units, and both had the same problem.  We found the Wi-Fi connections to be unstable.  Specifically, Skype-to-Skype calls regularly dropped off.  Loss of connectivity during regular internet usage was not as noticeable, but likely because it typically does not require a constant stream of data.  A completely different modem/router has eliminated the issues, so I can say definitively that the cause of the problems was the SBG6580 (specifically its Wi-Fi connectivity).<br /><br />Some have posted that power levels from the ISP may be the cause of the problem, but this is only if the modem itself loses its connection.  Wired connectivity did not seem to be an issue, only Wi-Fi.  So, that solution does not apply to the particular issue I am talking about.<br /><br />Also, take note that the dual-band frequencies do not operate concurrently.  It is switchable, so you can either run the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz, but not both at the same time.<br /><br />I have had good experiences with other Arris/Motorola networking hardware, but this model was a huge disappointment."
1.0,You can build a better PC for $1000 and better monitors for $1000. This is PC probably has a s*** motherboard and s*** GPU!
5.0,This was a gift for someone else that needed more memory space on there phone. I hope it works out for them.
3.0,"This charger, while it works, upon receiving it it was clear it was not Apple. It is an aftermarket charger, made of slightly lesser quality components. Hey, I can't complain too much, because the price is great!"
4.0,Very pleased with this product.
4.0,Fast and safe very good quality and has an excellent performaceA bit expensive comparing to other models in the store
3.0,"Came on time. Seems to work fine. Fits my Galaxy S4. It says it only added 29.8GB, though. Not 32GB."
2.0,We are not able to use because we have A T & T. We tried all different ways to make it work but it just can't work. I did not know that I only had 30 days to return this item. I really would like to return it since I am not able to use it. Please contact me so we can work out something.
3.0,"I waited over a month before submitting a review so I'd have a good idea about the tablet. I got this tablet so I could take care of business, such as email, blogging, internet searches, You Tube....I'm able to use all of these just fine. Of course the screen size doesn't compare to a laptop, but it's better than a phone. I like the travel size of the tablet. Pros: I can take care of business & even download numerous apps, it has plenty of space, I use it for Doulingo app, Bible app, Adobe PDF reader, Google hangouts/dialer (I can actually make phone calls on my tablet; voice & video calls) It has a front facing camera. If you don't have much to spend this will work for the basics. Cons: I noticed it takes hours to charge, (even when there is still 50% battery) I think it may be the charger that came with it? The volume isn't that great. The Sound Recorded app that came with it is worthless--you can hardly hear what you record & I haven't found any way to share the recordings. You can hardly see the screen at all when you are outside in bright sun. It's also hard to see a clear image from certain angles--if someone wanted to see screen with you. If you don't have a lot to spend this will work for most things. I'm thankful for it. If I needed something with good volume I don't suggest this product--unless you want to use bluetooth speakers or earbuds with it."
2.0,"A few issues that made me return this ZenPad within a couple of weeks of getting it:  - It was slow (browsing, keyboard, etc.), even compared to my now defunct Nexus 7. - It was buggy: for some reason the &#34;recent apps&#34; button kept pressing itself, rendering the tablet useless. - I was not thrilled with the 4:3 form factor (found it harder to hold with one hand) - Battery life was not that great - and recharge times were very long. - The display sharpness and colors were nice, but that was about it overall."
1.0,"I purchased two of these laptops for me and  my wife. I have purchased a plethora of goods in my 66 years of life and I have NEVER encountered this much difficulty trying to get these laptops to work or returned.  The vendor, expected me to contact Toshiba via the internet to address configuration issues, but I am not able to connect to the internet using these laptops. There are so many issues encompassing this purchase that I could never in good conscious recommend these products to anyone. I purchased these laptops on August 7th. Since then the product has been reduced in price by $100.00. I am not surprised!<br />."
3.0,"The price of the USB drive is significantly higher than that of a typical USB drive. The reason is that it's supposed to provide extra functionality for people who want that sort of thing. The concept is rather cool: you have a thumb drive onto which you can dump a bunch of files, and access said files from your computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc. And, rather than trying to set up the thing so that it shares through the network, you can just join the USB drive's own network and get things moving.<br /><br />In theory, this is pretty awesome. In practice, it's not. I couldn't get the wifi sharing to work. I joined the SanDisk wifi network. I installed the app on my iDevice. Nothing. The app pulls up nothing at all. I updated the firmware. Nothing. I turned off the power, and plugged it in to charge all night. Nothing. It's rather frustrating when the main reason for buying this drive over others does nothing for you.<br /><br />The reason it's not a 1-star is because the data transfer speeds are satisfactory, and for all it's got on board, it's relatively comparably sized to a typical USB drive."
3.0,"Formatted card with SDFormatter 3.1PC used to test this card Sony vaio C2D sz645 + vaio memory card adapter VGP-MCA20A.h2testw 1.4 test results:Test finished without errors.Writing speed: 6.94 MByte/sReading speed: 12.5 MByte/sH2testw v1.4Android phone Samsung Exhibit 2SDTools test result:9.3MB/s write21.3MB/s readAlso tested write speed with an older model Sandisk usb 2.0 sd card reader and cheap generic unbranded reader, get about same results.

2.0,Its good but keeps freezing when I'm on it for longer then an hour.
2.0,"If you want to use this mount for a laptop that will be sitting next to another screen (ex. a small laptop sitting to the side of a larger screen that is used as the primary screen), look elsewhere.<br /><br />This mount has a flawed design. Due to the flaw, the plate that the laptop rests on can never sit level (front to back).<br /><br />Also, your laptop can sit leveled (left to right) in a very limited amount of locations/positions relative to your primary screen. When you try to spin/rotate the laptop platform on a horizontal plane (X + Z axis) the defectively designed joint and mount under the laptop platform causes your laptop to dip to the left or right (depending on which way you spin the mounting platter). This causes the screen to be off-level. There is absolutely no way to compensate for this.<br /><br />If you want this mount is suitable for mounting to the back of a monitor as the defect in the joint does not affect this kind of mount. However, if you want to use the laptop platform, you are likely to have issues getting your laptop located where you want it, without the screen sitting at a wonky angle."
2.0,"Once product it installed, it works great.  However there are a few issues, which is why I only give it 2 stars.<br /><br />Purchased two and when I first received it, it wouldn't auto connect straight out of the box.  According to our Trendnet technical support call, we had to open both boxes and play with the jumper switches until I found a combination that worked for us.  After a few hours, I finally found a combination that worked.  Was happy it now works, but very unhappy about the amount of time it took to install something that should auto-connect. This brings me to the second issue I don't like about these things.<br /><br />The link lights on these devices are a general link - nothing more.  If ANY connection on EITHER converter is lost, ALL link lights turn off - including on the Ethernet switches.  This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot any type of connection issues.  These should have independent link lights for fiber and Ethernet instead of leaving us guessing where the problem is at.  Even though the pair I have is working great now, it makes me nervous thinking  any future issues we may have with them."
1.0,I can't get it to work properly. I spend way too much time trying to figure out how to get it to work
3.0,works well for the price
3.0,Works as expected.
4.0,Good for tbe price. Battery lasts 1.5 hours.
3.0,"I purchased this product through a computer store almost a year ago and it has been acting up since month 2. I keep my desktop on all the time and by the 3rd or 4th day, the device would stop working. No amount of unplugging or plugging back in or disabling/enabling or running the Windows troubleshooter would satisfy it. I would have to reboot the computer in order to restart the device. I just learned to live with it as annoying as it was when you have 33 tabs open in your browser, doing research. In the last 3 months, it started dying even faster, only lasting 1 - 2 days. Last night, it stopped working altogether and when I did a RESTART after it died, I got the Windows 10 Teal Screen of Death due to this device. I unplugged it and tested it on 2 other laptops and the device could not be initialized/recognized and it did not light up anymore. It also caused bizarre issues with my USB ports. I really like TP-LINK and have been enjoying a dual band router they produce without any issues. I plan on purchasing another TP-LINK, but a different model. I am thinking about the TL-WN8200ND. So, this product works great... when it works. I don't recommend it since it gave me trouble within 2 months and it's very unreliable. Thanks!"
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,I give this 3 stars because a the monitor Kept shutting off while I was trying to use the computer. But the seller was wonderful to work with to get the problem handled
3.0,not satisfied this product don't know how to put together.
5.0,Easy to put on! Thank you so much for making a product that is easy to apply! Great instructions.... Your protection screen is on my iPhone as well as my iPad..... Nice very nice!
2.0,"Not as durable as I hoped. Its very soft and I can't see it protecting much fron a fall or drop so I kept the styrofoam inside that came with it. It gets dirty rather quickly so I wouldn't get it in a color,  I should've gotten black. Overall just a regular carrier. Something I should've gotb from 5 and below. NOT WORTH 25 DOLLARS!"
1.0,"Arrived with bad block.  It comes with software on the drive, but the driver install software won't run because of the bad block."
2.0,the 3.0 is not working
3.0,Good and bad. It can cause screen issues on my iPad mini.
2.0,"Ordered 2 foot cables.  Received 3 foot cables without being contacted.  Yes they work, but my patch panel is still a mess."
2.0,Stops working after 2 weeks... It will not charge any more!  Dud!
1.0,didn't fit as advertised
3.0,Really difficult to avoid dust particles.
3.0,Working so far.  Followed other instructions of other reviewers.  INSTALL PROGRAMMING BEFORE YOU INSERT ADAPTER!!  Best advice ever!  Thank you fellow reviewers!  I now have wifi back again!         UPDATE:  I have had this adapter for about two months and have changed my rating from a 5 star to a 3.  Panda 300Mbps worked beautifully in the beginning and now it is failing.  Unit gets too hot and does not have longevity.  I was lucky I got it to work right now.  Updating review and ordering another adapter.
4.0,HI DO IS JOB WELL BUT THE SMALL SIZE COVER WELL THE KEYBOARD WITHOUT THE WRIST REST IF YOU HAVE A WRIST REST ON YOUR KEYBOARD PLEASE BUY THE BIGGER SIZE I'LL COVER DEPEND ON YOUR DIMENTIONS
3.0,"the battery fit perfectly and seems to be of good quality.  Why 3 stars? It does the job but it doesn't last as long as I had hoped. At full charge the battery is drained at 80 minutes. That's enough time for me to finish up any work and close down but because the time is about an hour less than I was expecting, I wonder if it will really make 500 cycles? I wasn't running any programs while this &#34;test&#34; was running...:it sat idle. Is it the battery or are the older macs just that less power efficient? Who knows..."
1.0,Great monitor with incredible screen resolution -- for the first 35 days then screen covered in vertical colored lines.  Failed just past the Amazon return deadline.  Heavy call volumes so can't get through to a Dell representative.  Can't use Dell's warranty chat because monitors don't have service tags.  Pissed off at having wasted $400.
1.0,"We got Lost and Stolen item and Xfinity wouldn't activate it<br />[ASIN:B006IJHK96 Linksys Advanced DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem, Certified for Comcast and Compatible with Major Cable Providers (DPC3008-CC)]]"
3.0,This is an excellent product although I had to return to Microsoft for a new one as it died two weeks after delivery. Surprised that it doesn't have an hdmi video output and had to purchase a special adapter to view on another monitor or big screen TV.
4.0,"This card seems to work well ,enough speed and so far it's working just fine ,good value for great quality ,LHB"
2.0,"This came in and worked well for my apps on my phone. I didnt realize until I tried to connect it to my laptop that it's software wasnt available. It would upload to Evernote, but it wouldnt let you do anything with it. The regular software was terrible and the firmware update didnt ever complete."
2.0,Did not see any difference in my range. I sent it back.
4.0,"This product is great, it is very small and very easy to get missed placed"
4.0,"Expected for category (netbook/laptop): 8.1 OS (still can upgrade); no touchscreen; limited disc (solid state); slower than usual laptop. Also, the trackpad requires the thumb strength of Larry Graham doing slapbass to engage the padbased mouse clicks.  So, in general, this category can't get above 3.  For this category: 5 Fantastic value.  Better value than even Chromebooks.     On balance. 4"
5.0,Good price
4.0,Always have multiple shots at your dataI lost some photos due to a corrupt cardI used this for my phoneThe company did replace my card with no problemsBeen working great for the past few months
5.0,I got exactly what I was looking for. Quick delivery and apparently perfect item so far.
5.0,There were no issues with this card and my Galaxy S4. 29.71 GB usable space (as was expected). Price was right too.
2.0,I bought the Samsung S27D390H 27-Inch Screen LED Monitor previously and needed a second monitor. I saw this was available as a newer version and cheaper. After recieving the Monitor and having them side by side this screen is much duller. The older one was bright white. This has a hint of yellow in it (and it is off the eye saver mode)
4.0,"Easy set up, like it. It works and is easy to use with multiple machines due to one small USB connector."
3.0,Works fairly well but the green is actually blue.
4.0,This is the second time I have purchased this product but last time it was for my phone...I really loved the price for starters compared to a zagg cover or some other expensive ones. I love that there are 2 in the box! The method in which to apply then is a little extensive and the numbers on my products were backwards from the picture but getting the jist of the method was not difficult to figure it out. The material is not a completely clear film but rather has a slight frost to it. This doesn't effect the ability to see through it clearly once applied and I guess is what allows it to have it fingerprintless quality. It doesn't bother me one bit and I love not seeing fingerprints all over my screen. I would not hesitate to purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend!!
2.0,"This product was D.O.A. The USB port was not properly aligned with the hole, making it almost impossible to get the USB cable in. I tested two different drives. Both received power but were not recognized by any computer in my house. After only spinning a few minutes, I could already feel the enclosure getting hot. Had to return for a refund."
5.0,bought this to replace a faulty card on my phone and it works great. haven't had any performance or corruption issues with it at all.
1.0,From what I've noticed the shield is a little to big or maybe it's suppose to be. I had to cut mine to fit..
5.0,excellent
3.0,It is a lot more useful to use this when trying to do fine point related activities.  However I felt like I was scratching the heck out of my screen using this.
5.0,"I use this microSD card with my Android tablet all the time.  I store lots of movies and books on it, and it works great.  Highly recommend it."
1.0,Horribly sound when tracking Apple iMac mouse over it. Sounds like a large scratching sound.nice to look at it but that's about it.
1.0,"Not only do this only last a few months, but the warranty is only 30 days so my daughter is SOL. And if you go to the iBenzer website for any contact info, there isn't any. I guess you get what you pay for."
1.0,Very dissapointed - it's going to slleep immediatly after any action and it takes a lot of time / clicks / freezes to wake it up again.
2.0,"Alienware 14x WiFi stopped working, same as with every other owner of this laptop.<br />Purchased this as a temporary measure, but ended up using it full time.<br />Not the greatest WiFi adapter but performs with very little problems, for the exception of the times when it stops<br />performing at peak operation. Happens a few times a week.<br />Always thought it was my router or modem until I decided to do a speed test from my IPhone, 22mb iPhone, Edimax adapter, 1.2mb or less if not reset or removed then reinserted into its usb port."
3.0,Weak signal. Sent back
5.0,great little SD....
3.0,"I believe that this cooling stand will work quite well for some and so I urge you to know what you are purchasing and read both specs and reviews to determine whether you fall into that category.  That being said, I see both positives and negatives to this design and I'll give my impressions based on having tested several laptop coolers over the years.  To begin with, I almost always use a cooling stand when doing any real work as I am running a high end graphics laptop that runs on the warmer side (with a high end graphics and two HDD's) and is housed in an aluminum case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The stand is relatively sturdy.  It is a mixture of some type of metal and plastic.  It is heavy enough not to feel cheap and light enough not to be off-putting.  The fans are fairly large and for the most part cover each of the corners to the middle of the stand giving it a large area of coverage (for fan effectiveness, please continue reading below).<br /><br />The stand comes with a standalone braided usb cable (which should help with wear and tear) which gives plenty of reach from the back of the stand where the USB inputs are to any USB input on your laptop.  You will also find the fan controls on the back of the stand near the USB inputs.  There is cord management on the bottom center of the stand which is convenient as the USB used to power the stand is not connected permanently on one side and could get lost otherwise.<br /><br />There are two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand that are meant to keep the fans off whatever surface the stand is resting on.  This is a great feature as it increases air flow around the fans on the bottom of the stand which is especially important if you're using this, for example, on your bed on top of a comforter which would leave no space between the bottom of the stand and the material.  These &#34;feet&#34; are plastic and while they seem sturdy, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over the long run. There are also two feet on the top of the laptop (the side that the laptop sits on) which are smaller and also made of plastic.  There is no documentation with the stand to explain what these two smaller feet are for and I can only assume it's to counter the slant that is created by the feet on the bottom of the stand (basically, it helps the laptop to sit more flat relative to the surface the cooling stand is on).  I've not seen this feature on any of the cooling stands I've used before and I think that it is a smart idea as I do not always want a significant slant when typing as it can cause discomfort in one's wrists (see more on this below).<br /><br />Finally, the 12-month warranty the AMNIE offers is a very nice feature and I appreciate a company standing behind their products.  Could it be longer?  Any warranty could always be longer, but I believe at this price point $25-$30, a one-year warranty is absolutely appropriate and one could even argue it's more than appropriate when many electronic components come with 90-day warranties.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I found the dimensions of this product to be less than 16&#34; x 11&#34; (and the dimensions are actually listed as slightly bigger than that online).  I wish that I had taken a picture of this before returning the product, but I was more concerned with getting a product that would work for my needs as soon as possible.  This was a significant issue for me as the description states that it supports a 17&#34; laptop, which I have (I actually pulled out a measuring tape and measured the length and width prior to ordering for this very reason).  Had the measurements been spot on, it would have fit perfectly, however it does not.  The irregular shape of the stand also adds to issue because a slight overhand is compounded in the areas where the shape angles in towards the center of the stand (in the middle of each side).<br /><br />With regards to the two retractable kickstand-like feet on the bottom of the stand, as I mention above, I wonder how well they would do with a larger and heavier laptop over time.  With regards to the two smaller feet on the top of the stand, I quickly found a design fault.  Being that they are smooth plastic and most bottoms on laptop are metal or some other smooth surface, there is absolutely no traction/friction and a laptop could easily side off of these feet if, for example, it was accidentally bumped or while you are moving the stand and laptop.  It would have been a simple addition to add a rubber-like pad or some other material/coating on the end of those feet which would create friction.  This is a real surprising oversight on the designer's part.  Unfortunately, I did not take note of whether this issue exists on the bottom set of feet.  However, I feel that this would be less of an issue due to the fact that the feet are larger and therefore have a larger surface area and also have the weight of the stand and the laptop bearing down on them which would impact their stability in this area.<br /><br />This is personal preference of course, and I will explain why, but I feel that the stand-alone USB power cable is less than ideal.  I truly disliked the fact that the cable used to power the stand, a USB cable, is not connected permanently to the cooling stand.  You might conclude that not being permanently connection makes it easier to pack up and store and not worry about damaging the connection, but if it were permanently attached, there is no need to have such a vulnerable connection.  The connection could be made internally and the only thing protruding would be a malleable cable with one usb connection.  This is a design choice of course, but it could become problematic because it makes the cable easier to lose.  How many times have you lost or forgotten a cable?  But &#34;what about the included cable management&#34; you ask?  How many times have you packed up for the night and didn't put everything away because youwere in a hurry or [insert any number of excuses here]. Sure, you can replace this cable, but it is one more expense and it would be a definite inconvenience.  Also, again there is the increased chance of damaging the male and female USB components at the stand connection point where there is normally only one (if that cable was internally connected as it is on my current, time tested, laptop cooler).<br /><br />Finally, perhaps most important (aside from the size issue because if it doesn't fit, what's the point?) is the effectiveness of the fans.  As I mentioned previously, I have a laptop that runs warm and sometimes downright hot.  If you have a laptop that runs warm-hot, I do not believe this will work for you.  I found the fan output to be very week when leaving my hand next to them.  That being said, it appeared to keep the surface of the stand (which I believe, if I remember correctly, was some sort of metal) a relatively neutral temperature.  So, it's not entirely ineffective, but I can say with certainty that it is not equipped to deal with a laptop that runs quite warm.  In case there are any naysayers who will try to make the argument that a laptop shouldn't run that warm/hot and that is a bigger issue, that's really neither here nor there.  Some laptops run like that and have since the day they were first powered up.  As I said, this cooler isn't ineffective, it's just not going to be effective enough for certain laptops.  Also, my GPU is located in the upper left corner of my laptop (under the Escape key essentially) and so I need more cooling in that area than anywhere else.  In fact, the rest of my laptop is almost always room temperature.  So, I was taking a leap of faith with this cooler stand, hoping that the decent fan coverage in the corners would be enough to do the job...Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Since the lighting that accompanies the fan operation is completely unnecessary, I would only make sense to cut out the fancy unnecessary blue lighting and use the extra power to amp up the fan output.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The AMNIE AE-CP1501 appears to be well built for its price.  If you have a laptop less than 16&#34; you should be fine with regards to product dimensions and for the average laptop (not build for serious graphics work or gaming) it will likely do a decent job cooling your machine.  In that case, I'd say that if you like the way this looks and the price is right, give it a shot.  If you have a 17&#34;+ laptop, I believe that you'll find it runs a bit short which makes managing both the laptop and the cooling stand a bit much and as it is an irregular shape (not a rectangle, but with several additional angles added in for show as opposed to increase air flow), it makes that even more cumbersome.  I ended up returning the product and ordering the newest version of the cooling stand I had purchased twice over the last 5 years [[ASIN:B00ED3WMTC Cooler Master NotePal U3 PLUS - Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad with 3 Moveable High Performance Fans (Black)]]).  The only reason I purchased something else (the AMNIE cooler) was because I was looking for an alternative that did not come with a fixed incline, but I suppose I learned not to mess with what isn't broken as everything else on it perfectly for my needs and also came with an extended warranty."
5.0,This was the perfect addition to my Surface tablet.  It came in easy to open packaging and it worked from the moment I pout it in the Microsoft Surface tablet.  Expanded my 32 g tablet to a lot more storage for movies and music.
5.0,was able to increase storage on my Surface RT. No more carrying around an external hdd. Holds enough of my music library.
4.0,"this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times, my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so I have to reboot, not sure if it's the phone or the card, I got 2 of these one for me and the wife, her's never have any issues. I can live with it, it happens every so often ..."
4.0,"Comfortable and nice, yet bulky and collects dust easily"
1.0,did not work at all
3.0,"It works as a replacement for the original power cord (I use an HP Pavilion g7-1237dx and this was recommended since the original power cord had some sort of defect). I have no complaints. The adapter can get hot very easily though, even if it's just resting on a carpet without anything else near it, so if you get it, be sure to have the adapter as isolated as possible, so it has good airflow around it."
1.0,"I bought this for my Pebble Steel and it is a total waste of money, it does not charge at all and the magnet at the connector is not strong enough to hold to the watch."
4.0,Works well. Does not have any more range than others.
5.0,Just what the doctor ordered for my Galaxy Tab 3 Tablet... Now there's plently of room left over for everything...
4.0,It's a great looking stand
3.0,It did not fit my keyboard :(
1.0,"I bought this because I like thin mouse pads with a non-cloth surface. Once I put it on my desk, it stuck right away and stayed put until I had to move it. After that it no longer stuck to the surface and it started to slowly warp more and more. Now it's warped to the point where my laster mouse no longer function properly. I basically can no longer use it and will have to look elsewhere for a mouse-pad. After this experience I would definitely not recommend this mouse-pad to anyone who is a serious gamer."
4.0,"Easy to install and use using Widows Fax.<br />Just plugged into USB and Windows 10 installed without any problem.<br />Only Con - It does not come with a manual, and so far I have not been able to find one online."
4.0,I can't say how this video card performs because Amazon accidentally sent me the GeForce GTX 960 instead. After calling them about the mix up they told me to keep it for which I was grateful. The 960 performs extremely well and I would recommend it to anyone who can afford it and is into higher end gaming.
3.0,"I ordered this for my laptop because my original battery could barely hold a charge for an hour. When i first bought this as a replacement it reeked of chemical smells, which made me hesitant to use it. However, my bf assured me that the smell was probably just cleaning solution residue left on the battery. I popped the battery into my laptop  and immediately it said 70 percent charged. Later I let my laptop charge to 100% to see how long my laptop could 'feed off of the battery. It took 2.5 hours till my laptop required to be recharge. I have only had the new battery for a couple days, but so far it seems to be working well. I will update my review if i notice any drastic decrease in power supply/ or other issues that may pop up."
5.0,"This was immediately recognized by my Windows 8.1 laptop. I had to re-format this from ExFAT to FAT32 in order to have it be recognized by my Samsung Note 2 and my 7&#34; Android tablet.It took a long time to transfer 25 gb of video files from laptop SSD hard drive over to the SdXC card--I imagined that it would happen more quickly. .. but it did work smoothly.Overall, this is what I wanted and it was a great deal for the price!"
1.0,"Don't waste your money.  This mouse is always freezing up.  It has a mind of its own.  I spend more time trying to get the mouse to unfreeze than I do getting any work done!  I wound up throwing the mouse against the wall because I was so frustrated.  Once again, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2.0,"Case didn't fit right, so can't close it all the way. Bummer."
4.0,Very usefull and handy SD Card Storage.
2.0,"I really like the case since it did everything i needed as was very well priced.  Unfortunately quality is lacking.  I bought one of these and the side pocket zipper fell off in two weeks.  I figured this was fluke, i bought a new one and the main case zipper fell off in less than two weeks.  Zippers are pretty integral to cases and bags and will get used quite a bit.  Any level of QA would have caught this.  Bu"
4.0,"works as it should, so far."
3.0,"I gave it three stars cause I'm really disappointed that I didn't get it in the right color. I would get a replacement but I don't want to have to spend more money for it to ship faster. Other than that it really is great, the tablet that I have fits perfectly in there. I can also fit in a binder,  (but not to easily) 3 composition note books, pencil bag,pro folio, & a couple of small things. Hope this review helped"
5.0,"What more can be said?  It's a great card with plenty of storage space to handle or expand your tablet, camera or video cameras needs.  With the included SD card adapter, the micro card can be read in any SD card reader/writer.  It is initially formatted in some format that my Windows 8 Pro MS Surface Pro could read or see.  But from another laptop using the SD adapter I was able to reformat it and make it usable for the Surface Pro.Great card for a great price!"
4.0,"As expected, connection with extender is slower. But my husband is happy he can listen to Pandora in the garage now."
4.0,"Just put it in, laptop still kinda slow but I'll give it some time and see"
5.0,"I've started buying all of my SD cards with the adapter. These is no reason to limit myself with having a large card when I need a small one. At first I was concerned about connection reliability when the small card was inserted into the large one, but I haven't had a single problem so far.This one performed as expected and otherwise is more flexible than a standard large size SD card. Fully recommended."
1.0,"This quit working after a month. I am so disappointed. I had one before that last a year until the charging unit inside got broken by my daughter trying to plug it in, so I bought a new one here. Well, after a month it started shutting off by it's self and wouldn't stay on longer than 30 seconds. So annoying."
4.0,My only complaint is the ear muffs are not comfortable for long periods of time.  Anything over 30 minutes becomes a pain in the ear literally.
1.0,"By far the worst computer I have own.  Worked &#34;ok&#34; new out of the box, but make no mistake, this thing is slow.  After about 3 months it got even slower, for no reason.  No virus or other problems to cause it.  Installed windows 10 and thing got worse.  Sometime computer wont start up, you only get a blank screen, you can see the screen back light. Horrible to surf the web and a lot of bugs, Computer goes into standby mode when power cord is plugged in,the screen brightness sometimes is backward. Slide to dimmer and screen get brighter and the other way around.  Programs won't open when you click on them.  They maybe caused by Windows 10.  I have always bought Toshiba computers and this is my first Lenovo, and not happy with it.  Most likely won't be a repeat customer for them."
3.0,good.!
3.0,"I actually miss the keyboard unit I had (3rd Gen, I believe.) Navigating the touch-screen on this thing to highlight, make notes, etc., is quite frustrating. I'm constantly accidentally getting too much or too little. When I remove my finger from the screen it often jumps ahead or back. I use an iPhone daily and don't have issues, so I think these controls just needs some tweaking."
5.0,This thing works perfectly. I've hand no problems with SanDisk and this SD card rocks. Why can't they have phone with this much storage internally?
4.0,"I really like the back-lit screen; the illumination is even and there's no glare; it can be adjusted to fit the ambient level of light.<br /><br />As a book reader it's good.  I still have my old Kindle with the buttons to compare with.  I like the buttons a bit more than the tap of the Paperwhite but I like the Paperwhite screen and text more than the old Kindle's.<br /><br />The web browser uses a different interface than the book reader which has confused me.  For example, when you want to get more of the page, you 'swipe up' instead of 'tap for next page'.  In the Kindle store a swipe-up motion often is taken as a tap-to-select motion and I often find that I can't use links on pages (e.g. on the page of results from a Google search).  I tap the link but it's not selected and not gone-to.  You will probably say &#34;Of course, it's not a tablet&#34;, and I will agree but the old Kindle can go through a link on a page, once you 'mouse' down to it with the five-way selector.<br /><br />I got this because I wanted the lit screen and the smaller form-factor.  I'm quite happy with it for those reasons."
5.0,Card works fine with no hiccups or issues. Speed of card is fine with the dash camera and download to laptop.
1.0,"Bought it for performance work. At first it worked incredibly well, very fast and reliable; easy to carry around. It started after a couple of months to unmount out of the blue, randomly and not associated with any task, whether in use or just plugged in. Today it won't mount at all, jeopardizing important work. Got a GDrive for their reputation and I'm experiencing the complete opposite. I will update my review based on a concrete solution."
3.0,Appears that Apps may be somewhat limited
3.0,"The instruction that came with the item was NOT accurate at all, we had to call technical support and ended up being on hold for more than 30 minutes.  The person was helpful but she did not seem to understand the connection issue right away, she provided an instruction that was not included in the instruction that came with the package.  If only they can update the instruction, which will definitely be much less confusing."
4.0,"I've already bought two. Very good product!<br />One I keep the Windows 8.1 and the other I update to Windows 10, both are working so far very well."
2.0,"It may work for other people, but not for me. Sure, it connects to the internet, but I am two doors down from my router and I am still only getting one to two bars."
5.0,"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4, no problems, good speeds. Price was right, couldn't go wrong. Also have tested in my GoPro and also works well."
1.0,"I bought this case because the price is decent and there are few universal bluetooth keyboard cases for tablets.<br /><br />First, the pros. The case itself looks nice. It's fairly thin but good enough to protect the tablet from light incidents. The keyboard itself is amazing and the touchpad works great.<br /><br />The cons.<br />The case is thin. Too thin in my opinion. There is no magnetic clasp, you have to thread the little piece through a very small opening that is quite tedious and doesn't work well when one is on the go.<br />The keyboard constantly falls out. The magnets are nowhere near strong enough and the keyboard goes flying when you try to close the case or just pick it up. Very sad. The case is missing a stylus holder. Not a deal breaker on the stylus holder, but it is a real downside. The little holders for the tablet are cheap and flimsy and started to fall apart on day one when I was inserting the tablet.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great idea. The keyboard and touchpad are exactly what I wanted. Sadly, everything else is not. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a case unless you can fashion an idea to keep the keyboard in place. I've already returned mine and bought a different case."
2.0,"I used this for my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. Worked fine for about a week or two, then it just stopped working completely. I suggest looking elsewhere if you plan on using it long term."
2.0,"T I ordered a gray for my MacBook 12-inch laptop. The cover was disappointing because it had a visual flaw in the plastic... A bit of a brown swirl. I didn't bother to return because, let's be honest, it is only $20.  I could live with it. The plastic and manufacturing is very cheap. The silicone rubber on the bottom has begun to peel off and it leaves tiny pieces of clear silicone all over my pants when I use it on my lap. The edges are starting to wear.  This is brutal. I would gladly pay $60 for a problem free cover... The $19.99 price tag is starting to show.  Don't make the same mistake I did and think, &#34;whats the risk? It is $20, if it stinks I will toss it.&#34;  This is good enough not to toss initially but bad enough to give you just enough pain before you finally do."
2.0,It didn't hold the table in place
5.0,Really you can't say anything bad about it. Does what it says. Super fast and great storage size for lots of movies and such.
4.0,So far it's worked great.
4.0,"Love the bag. Exactly as described. Perfect format, looks good.<br />The only small little down side is the fabric underneath the shoulder straps is rough on the skin if you are wearing tank tops."
3.0,Arrived quickly but it doesn't fit my HP laptop .😦
1.0,The product wouldn't adhere to my Kindle at all.
4.0,Satisfied with items.
1.0,Can't put any apps on it.
3.0,Bottom portion of the case does not stay on very well. Top portion is a great fit. Not sure if I can recommend this case.   **Update 11/26/15** It's only been a few month and the case has a small crack already from just normal usage. My MBP has never been dropped so I dont know how there's a crack on the case.
1.0,"Purchased two and both broke in the exact same way, just after the 30 day return period. Plastic hinge is not durable."
4.0,Works great
1.0,"i bought the belkin keyboard because i use my ipad air for work - taking notes during meetings or during the day. so i was looking for something that was simple to use, connected easily and seamlessly to my ipad air and allowed me to work smoothly.<br />this keyboard does none of the above. the connection process is complicated and unclear. it disconnects quickly and suddenly - and to re-connect i often have to use several different steps (in varying sequences)in the middle of taking notes or writing an email. the instructions are short and unclear and you get virtually no help from their email help group - i sent a few emails out that were unanswered - surprising given how much this keyboard costs. it is definitely not worth the price."
3.0,its very big for me
4.0,"As pictured, have not tried to apply yet. Will let everyone know how they look when I do"
1.0,"Doesn't work , don't buy"
4.0,i keep locking it when i try to hit backspace but i end up hitting lock so have to wake up screen again ... i would have put the off and the backspace buttons reversed. otherwise it works well
2.0,tips wear out too fast and you can't get your screen to move even while pressing down hard with the instrument
5.0,"Puchased this card right after I received my Samsung Galaxy S III. Truly found this to be quicker than any other class 10 card I've owned. The cost on Amazon was far less than I've seen anywhere else. If ""you're"" looking for this type of product, then this is the one for you...IMHO of course."
5.0,"Great fast storage. Works great as my Galaxy S4 storage card. You can always rely on sandisk products. Pay a little more sometimes, but worth it."
5.0,I quadrupled the memory in my Windows Surface with a tiny push of the Memory card into the allotted slot. Way to go SanDisk.
4.0,"Sometimes when the price is too low you get less than you paid for. My suspicions were deepened when the package arrived with generic packaging, not the brand label of &#34;SanDisk Ultra.&#34; Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the product. It works fine. Sure beats the price Walmart was charging for a 64 GB micro SD card."
5.0,This works with the NL1520.  No video stuttering like with the 64gb.  Blah blah blah blah to fill in the rest.
3.0,"Not a bad product but it get heated, that probably means a low quality piece. Of course it work better in recent monitors models. Because in old models  you must do is adjusting the gamma, brightness and contrast levels"
1.0,Won't load windows cant return it or use it! Waste of time and money! I'm done!
3.0,Product came on time and was as advertised.  I personally don't like the feel and responsiveness of the mouse when gaming.
4.0,This works absolutely fantastic but i do i have one complaint and have not rated it five stars because one issue it does have is it tends to get hot maybe there should be a fan in this unit.
3.0,Works fine. Got it plugged into a Toshiba laptop. Got to keep devices plugged in specific ports as if you unplug and mix the serial/USB ports get confused and keep adding ports in the device settings.
5.0,"Excellent product for small tablets, cell phones etc.Product exactly as described!  Fast delivery!"
5.0,"Works great for AARP RealPad.  Only thing is no hole for camera, but it is easy to get case off & back on."
5.0,it works as intended.  don't notice the difference from other memory cards. (only typing this to meet minimum words required)
5.0,Perfect case for your mac book pro. It doesn't make the computer much heavier but it still protects it very well. The keyboard cover fits perfectly and the product is made of good material. Would definitely buy again.
2.0,Doesn't seem to want to extend the WiFi channel I need extended. Will have to work on it.
1.0,"It would of been absolutely perfect, if it wasn't for that right after i got it, the pointer started shifting one little click to the left every few seconds, wouldn't even be that bad of a problem, if it wasn't for the play menu coming up every time on netflix, and other programs that run full screen. Other then that, it would have gotten 5 stars."
3.0,"I purchased these because they were inexpensive, but they are just OK. They do work, but they don't get very loud at all, even with the volume on the computer at 100% and the volume on the speakers over 50%. There is no bass reproduction to speak of. The only redeeming qualities of these speakers are their inexpensive price and their small size."
4.0,shorter then I thought they would be. So had to get monitor stands
2.0,"I purchased 4 of these laptops for the office.<br /><br />The keyboard layout uses chicklet style keys. These keys are small and spaced out. After many years of using more traditional keyboards, I found it very hard to type without constantly missing keys and having to retype my words. This significantly slowed me down on my work. I recommend using a wireless mouse.<br /><br />The trackpad I also found to be a bit on the small side. As well as the buttons for the track pad. I found it difficult to use multi-touch. It rarely recognized my commands like, scroll, pinch and zoom, etc. Again, using this trackpad for your mouse is a hassle. Get a wireless mouse.<br /><br />The display is big, but brightness lacks a bit. Not very good in very bright environments.<br /><br />Design, looks good in the pictures on the site. But in person this laptop looks plasticy and cheap.<br /><br />Lastly, the specs are great on paper but in use the laptop constantly hung on me while trying to install programs and getting it setup for office use. I was installing Microsoft Office and some pdf programs. Manufacturer responded to me and said possibly the computer was doing updates in the background. I suppose that's possible since I had just turned it on.<br /><br />I did like the size of the power adapter. It's very small.<br /><br />Overall not a terrible or unusable computer, specially considering the price. But everyone else raved about it so I wanted to share some faults I found with it so you can make your own decision."
1.0,I returned to order a 11.6 laptop so I could have full operations than having a Notebook. I am sure this is good quality as I have purchased San Disk numerous times.
3.0,I liked the case.  It lasted about 1 year before the plastic got brittle and started to break.  Eventually the magnets that hold the case closed fell out and rendered the case practically useless.  I have replaced it with a different brand.
1.0,"This card continually unmounted in my S4. It was really painful, when I remounted the card I sometimes retrieved my files, sometimes not. I have to say, though, that a card test in my PC, using Crucial diagnostics, went fine. My gut feel is that the card overheats, and shuts down in the S4, although I have no proof of this. What I do know is that it didn't work for me, and many others (google it). Naturally, Amazon refunded me the purchase cost when I returned the card, gotta love Amazon.I now have a Samsung 64g card, and no problems so far. I like Sandisk, but there's a compatibility problem here with the S4."
4.0,"My camera required it, the brand has a good history, my experience with the brand over years has been very good, the price was ok, buying via Amazon is the easiest, least aerobic way to go.  I've not found cards much cheaper from other brands and personally like to stick with those with which I have good experience."
3.0,I bought one but it died on my galaxy s4 but i sent it in to sand disk and they sent a brand new one.
4.0,great monitor!!! very nice!
3.0,"I generally have problems with extra buttons on mice, so take it with a grain of salt if you are a button lover.  On this mouse, there are buttons above and below the place where the thumb rests.  The space between the buttons was a little too narrow, leaving me prone to accidentally press the upper or lower.  The mouse button below the thumb is assigned to the &#34;reduce volume&#34; command.  None of the buttons are assigned to the &#34;increase volume&#34; command.  I found myself lowering the volume accidentally.  There is no accompanying program to reassign keys, and even X-mouse couldn't touch it.  I note that you can't reassign the volume controls on Microsoft keyboards that have them, so you seem to be stuck with it."
1.0,"Does not work. Should be the same as an older model which I now have, but maybe damaged."
3.0,Um nothing much to really say about it . The adapter for it works but I gave it 3 stars because it goes in n out sometimes
1.0,This product didn't even last a week before it started to fall apart don't waste your money.
3.0,"My family and I have used Belkin products before mostly as covers for our Kindle Fire's and this seemed like a nice product to try as an addition to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 that we have. I have been looking at possibly purchasing a new laptop or just getting a keyboard for my Galaxy. I decided to try this keyboard case in hopes of getting something that would keep me from shelling out big money for a new laptop and just see what I could accomplish with this keyboard case. Hopping that this would cure me of wanting a new laptop. I was pleased with the design of the case and the keyboard itself was very sturdy even though it didn't seem to add much additional weight to the overall product. In other words, it didn't seem overly bulky or cumbersome.<br />One of the issues that I had was that it didn't seem to pair very well with my tablet and connection kept dropping. Even though it started out as something I was very interested in and wanted to really be happy with it ended up rather disappointing. It does have a QWERTY keyboard with the functions of most laptop keyboards and the case itself fit very well. I was happy with how the case set up in the open position but when I was just using my Galaxy for reading I would just take it out of the case. Ultimately, even with some nice features,  I found that it was something that I really don't see myself using very much."
3.0,"Meets the standards but nothing impressive, the price was nice but it added extra 20 dollars if you want to buy it from Canada, also make very loud noises when starting system with it."
3.0,"Yes it is a nice tablet, a little bit heavier than i thought.. to read its just fine."
4.0,"I bought these for my son and uses them all the time, so I have to believe he likes them"
1.0,"dont buy this refurbished piece of sh#t. I bought this product on June 2015 and i m ordering a new mouse because it is not working properly. if you are looking for high quality Razer mouses, then DO NOT PURCHASE this one"
2.0,Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I'm not able to delete. I do not want to sent it back to SanDisk for replacement.
2.0,meh
1.0,Definitely not worth the money
3.0,"When it works, it is a solid headset, even with drivers installed and every. This Headset is not True 7.1 surround sound as advertised it is only emulated through software, but it is still superb.<br /><br />there is a problem i am constantly getting with it though that is knocking the stars down by 2, it will randomly turn off even after a full charge, and it is the most annoying thing if i am in a call and all of the sudden my headset turn off, its just a minor annoyance that turns into a big one when its every 15 minutes for an hour."
1.0,I have been using this computer for months now. streaming videos and t.v shows are soooooo slow. loading pages so slow. the audio speakers and headphone output are horrible. I am sad that I didn't return this thing when I had the chance. but I wanted it to be great and I wanted to give it a shot but this computer has turned out to be a huge waste of money. it makes me sick that I spent this money on this thing. oh and I constantly get programing errors and glitches like icons on my desktop that shouldn't be there and I cant even click on it to remove it. I am telling you there are major issues with this machine.
1.0,This has never worked right and now I have been told we have a pirated version of windows 7
2.0,Ended up unusable because when zoomed to a person it's worse than my laptops cam.
5.0,"So far, no complaints. Excited about the price. Excited about the size. I only hope my files won't get erased randomly. I will try to update this in a few weeks."
5.0,"Easy install, worked perfect."
4.0,"Purchased this tablet as a gift and works as advertised. For the price, it has many useful features. Very happy to have purchased this as a gift."
5.0,What more can be said?  This card is made by the leader in flash memory and was a reasonable price and very fast.
1.0,I get the table is used me I'd like to change it for a new
5.0,This is my favorite hard drive to upgrade laptops to! It's standard laptop drive. works great in non retina macs and it definitely provides a speed boost. It has a solid 8gb of SSD for the OS and common used apps.
5.0,"haven't been able to use this in the capacity that I bought it, for a tablet pro, but I have used it in a usb adapter and it works well there."
4.0,So far so good.<br />Good read and write speeds it seems like I got a genuine Samsung ( I've heard a lot of complaints about knockoffs)
3.0,"Obviously a fake copy, but I expected it for the price. The game is still playable, and thats all that really matters to me."
5.0,SanDisk never disappoints. As always SanDisk products are worth every penny. Nice product and quality and works great. I recommend this product to everyone.
1.0,"It did not work with my iPod shuffle. I don't know why, it was not worth my time to send it back and ask for a refund so I didn't."
1.0,"Bought this with my Samsung Galaxy S4 when it first came onto market and it worked for about a week then quit. All of the pictures I had taken originally and stored on this card are just gone, it was a bad purchase and after looking through numerous forums, hundreds or thousands of people were having the same issues with this card and the Galaxy S3 + 4, I do not recommend buying this card if you'll be putting it in a galaxy. I'd like to tell sandisk where they can put it."
4.0,Improved speed.
4.0,Very good quality aftermarket case for my tablet. ASUS should have released their branded cases with the tablet. Too bad because I bought this one and its amazing.
1.0,"Sadly I missed the return window by a couple of days.  this card got flaky in my galaxy note 2, a little google research and it appears this is a very well known and widespread issue with these class 10 32gb cards.  Avoid until it's fixed."
3.0,It protects ok but only lasted 3 wks before the kickstand broke then the following week the back cracked. I guess you get what you pay for.
4.0,You have to pirchase an extra piece in order to use it
1.0,"New Review:  The hinge keeps breaking because the plastic around it is too weak.  The plastic is cracking, its dificult to open and forcing it open only causes further damage to the weak plastic.  See the pictures below and look closely at edges near hinge.  I'm returning the second case in less than a year.  This one lasted exactly 30 days with TLC and no drops.  It's a beautiful case, the keyboard works pretty well for typing, but it's not engineered well enough - the easy part should have been using plastic that was strong enough, but Zagg failed on this one. Its too expensive to be this flimsy. Thank God I got the insurance.<br /><br />Old review:  I really like this case, and get compliments on it a lot.  It works well, fits in my purse, and the battery lasts more than 2 months on a charge.  It took me a few days to get used to the compact keys, but I can type pretty fast on it.  The one issue, which is why I think it's getting low ratings from others, is that you generally have to tell the Bluetooth to reconnect daily.  It's quick and easy to do from your iPad settings.  Frankly, I have this issue with all my Bluetooth devices: keyboards, stereo speakers, speakerphone in the car -so it's not unique to this keyboard and unfair to blame Zagg.  Maybe it's an Apple issue, but I think this keyboard deserves a higher rating so I gave it 5 stars."
3.0,"Shipping was quick and the follow up by the company was great.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the problem with my laptop still exists.<br />Apparently, it is my computer and not the part.  I actually would buy it again if I needed a battery."
5.0,does what is was designed
4.0,works great
1.0,Does not fit Samsung 10.1 2014 tablet.  I should have believed the other review.  The cost to send it back is not worth it.
1.0,"I wanted to like this case as I like using the Kickstand on my Surface Pro 3 and this case is compatible with it. That's where the pros end. What I don't like about this case is I feel it really cheapens our premium devices. In my opinion, the bottom is too soft and flexible it doesn't inspire any confidence in the ability of it to protect my Surface. The build quality is questionable as I could see slight imperfections in the rubber around the vents left over from manufacturing. However, the biggest drawback is I cannot remove the keyboard with the case on the device. To remove the keyboard, I must remove the case, take off keyboard, put case back on to use it like a tablet. The purpose of the magnetic keyboard from Microsoft is to quickly attach / remove it from the device. This prevents that, therefore I cannot recommend this case."
2.0,TF slot does not work.  The quality is low. Feels cheap. Memory cards don't go in smoothly. This product is made in China.
2.0,Doesn't hold a charge for very long.
2.0,"Gets dirty, and tough to wash out the particles that get stuck. Other than the maintenance, it does its job - protects the keyboard well."
3.0,"It fit &#34;okay&#34; there was nothing special about it. Actually my son refused to touch his tablet for about 2 weeks because he said &#34;it stinks&#34; from the smell of new rubber. The smell was pretty strong and took a while to go away, but obviously that doesn't affect the performance of the product."
2.0,"I have a , 2.0 USB  I didn't notice or even knew there is now a 3.0 drive. ; ("
5.0,Currently using this in my tablet for my retro gaming and it works great. Haven't lost anything and speed works fine. I don't have a negative thing to say it.
3.0,I love the color and feel of this case.  But... it is not quite what I expected.  I purchased this case for my kindle because it was supposed to have the auto wake sleep feature. It doesn't work.  I have another case that has this feature but due to the arthritis in my hands I need something I can hold on to without making my hands hurt. I really need this feature.
4.0,Kool case
1.0,"What a piece of junk. Bought one, updated firmware--it prompts you to do it--uuuuuunnnnnngggggggg.....lights are on, nobody's home. Can't access the router itself. Nothing but a warm brick. Sent it back, they overnighted another (yay amazon!). Downloaded updated firmware, and...uuuuunnnnggggg.....this one looks like everything works, except you can't connect wirelessly. Allows  you to change the SSID and passwords, pretends all is well--psych!--no connecto no matter whatto. Sent it back for refund. What a waste of time."
1.0,Product not what I expected. Better options for similar pricing. For under $15 ($10-$15) to be exact I would get smart/intelligent 6 USB port chargers.
4.0,No problem with storage and speed. I only had some difficulties to insert it in my card Kingston reader: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Flash-Memory-Reader-FCR-HS219/dp/B00109Y2DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356544341&sr=8-1&keywords=card+reader I believ due to a sticker covering something in one of the sides. Other microSD do not have this kind of problem with that reader.
2.0,"This case appears to be pretty low quality also the color is not as pictured. This is definitely not as vibrant and pretty at the hot teal shown, I will most likely return.. not satisfied."
3.0,Great but needs the folio
2.0,"Bought this mouse in the hopes it would work OK, it didn't the software would take 20 seconds of more to save changes as well it didn't work well at all on the lighting etc. The mouse slips in hand so if you need to pick it up to reposition on you mouse pad during gameplay good luck! The sides of the mouse barley have any texture and it doesn't have a rubberized finish. The top buttons are a good feature but my 3 finger sat on the top right button as the mouse seemed to &#34;bend&#34; to the left as the space for your finger was just a little small. All this did make for a good experience. PS I have medium sized hands! I have returned the mouse today and it will ship back to Amazon Monday 08/31/15"
4.0,"I was a bit weary about the look of this table...but it's awesome. I set it up by my window and I do my homework, it helps with my neck and back pain. It is super light weight and kinda flimsy feeling, but it is sturdy and easy to adjust. I recommend it."
2.0,"This supposedly was easy to install without bubbles, well... *I* coudln't do it.  Spent a LOT of time, and kept trying, and all I ended up doing was scratching the shield, and i was using the enclosed little plastic tool (which is just like a small credit card)  And still had bubbles and now two scratches as well.<br /><br />If I knew where I could get it installed professionally I am sure I would like it much better--I like having a blue blocker on the iPad, and I like this much better than the amber one I have."
5.0,"I really don't know that the complaints other posted were all about, but I have bought 3 of these sandisk micro sd card already.  for my phone, my wife and my daughter's phone. store lots of movies, pictures. videos....etc. all works just fine, no issues at all."
5.0,"Nowadays this memories don't have the fastest write speed, but even tho those are good speeds.On the other hand, SanDisk is a good mark.And, what adds even more value, imo, it's that those specific memory cards have a lifetime warranty.I got one damaged in 1 year, and they changed it.I really like this warranty service."
5.0,"Package arrive on 31Aug after placing an order on the 9th of Aug,<br />singapore.<br />it was bubble warped :)<br />thank you for the great service!<br />the quality of the decal is great is easy to use, it looks amazing on my mac!<br />THANKS!!"
3.0,"Excellent deal via Amazon promo, but the screen is so dark. I knew it wasn't lighted, but this is pretty dim. Ended up finding a Paperwhite on eBay for great price and it's much easier to read!"
2.0,Pros:<br />Scroll Wheel<br />Placement of ball is better than with a thumb trackball<br /><br />Cons:<br />Placement of buttons is uncomfortable and hard to work with<br />Left mouse button fails and quickly - I've had 2 of these and the left button failed on both of them within a matter of weeks. I'm not a hardcore gamer - but I do like to play video games occasionally. This is not something that I expected.
4.0,"It stores stuff like any other memory card.  Amazon - fantastic price.  I bought this for my Samsun Galaxy tablet 3 8.0 and it works perfect.  This maxes out the memory for that tablet.  Tip: store all your apps etc on your tablets internal memory and photos, movies, pictures on this card.  If you ever run out of space you can keep and extra card or two on hand.  If you store apps on this card then you will not be about to use them if you want to change out the card."
2.0,Looks different in the web page.
2.0,did not fit proper
5.0,Great device.  Prompt shipment.
5.0,"I use these as backup for my images when I am out on a photo shoot.  As of to date, they have been very effective in reducing weight and storage space in my pack."
1.0,"Card is Good. I ordered one before and it performs as one would expect, so I ordered another. It took much longer to attempt get the second one so I wrote and got a refund. Seller, NMicro Technology,  was not the same as the first."
1.0,These did not fit my ipad.
3.0,"While I enjoyed Pencil when it worked, it didn't work for long. Shortly after the warranty coverage ended, the eraser sensor consistently failed - I still use Pencil as a stylus, but it's a dead stylus at this point - I don't even bother pairing it with Paper when in use. (For what it's worth - the same issue happened to my friend's Pencil.)"
5.0,"I was looking for expanding memory of my Galaxy Note 3, so I bought this one. This is class 10 micro SD card. Good enough speed for the smart phones. The best way to upgrade the memory of the phone."
4.0,"I cannot say if it's the SD card or the phone, but google sez it's the phone. Put your MP3s on this card for your Galaxy S3, and the result is a jumble of corrupted files. Yep, that's what I got. So, in fairness to SanDisk, I gave this card 4 stars, and a suggestion to y'all out there, get the 16gb card for your S3 instead."
5.0,Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. Was a little worried about it being the right one because the documentation was skimpy and some people had problem getting 64GB working.No problem! Just slipped it and when I went to settings it recognized it immediately.Nice having the adapter so can move photos and files to my PC when I need it.
3.0,Unfortunately i ordered a case that was bigge than my tablet but otherwise it was good buy
1.0,"It worked for a while, I purchased 4 of them, then they just started dying.....one by one, none no longer work."
4.0,Don't recommend plug in external hard drive to this device.
5.0,"The decal came with directions, but I didn't understand them until I went on YouTube to figure out how to apply it so I suppose it takes some skill to apply it correctly, but it wasn't too difficult. The design has a matte finish and looks great.<br />I choose to put this on my 11'' Chromebook and it fit perfectly so I'm really pleased with this product."
1.0,Didn't work with my phone nor my tablet.. rip off
1.0,after 4 months it stopped working i got a new one form SanDisk but I'm very apprehensive to put it on my phone.
4.0,Worth the price but sometimes it has weird glitches and has issues with the storage. I bought a 32 gb SD card and the tablet still tries to use device storage! Extremely frustrating. I've even had it checked out and it just does its own thing. I constantly have to update it and delete alot of things off of it to leave enough roo  to use my normal apps.
3.0,"This fits the ticket! It's really good at cooling down my laptop, draws the heat away easily and quickly. And so very quiet. The only thing I didn't like about this one was while it has adjustable supports for two positions so if you raise it to the higher position and move tit and/or the laptop the support legs comes out of their supports really easy. Not a good thing and kind of irritating at that. Other it does the job it's intended for very well indeed."
4.0,great buy. This is my second Kindle Fire. I gave the 1st one to my daughter and now we share books
1.0,"I was under the impression that I was buying a new computer since no were in the description did it say that it was a refurbished computer. Have only had it for 3 months and the hard drive was corrupted so I had to pay to get a new hard drive installed. After all was done, the money I spent on this computer would have bought me a really nice new computer plus some extras. If you are wanting to by an HP, I suggest buying it from an authorized dealer and not amazon."
3.0,"Works well but too short to use on a portable battery, I reccomend the 6 inch cable."
2.0,"I have to assume that the brand new 64gb SanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDXC card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter/pausing that has happened since I started using it today.  Prior to that, never had an issue with my previous SanDisk SDHC card.  But today on its maiden trip, it has led each video (only 3-5 minutes long each) to have several performance issues that by default I have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and I've never had an issue in the four months that I've had my Galaxy Note 2.  No problems formatting this card though or installing/using it otherwise."
5.0,"Works great, several months after."
1.0,Not as advertised
3.0,Instant plug and play with mac. Does the job but slowly and is incredibly noisy.
3.0,The noise is too much and I can hear weird mechanical sounds coming from the pump at higher rpms.
4.0,Its a cable. It works. Not much more to say!
5.0,"Great microsdhc card,  use it on my phone for extra storage.  I have used this brand in the past and it works great.  Never a problem with ScanDisk."
3.0,Nice color and the magnetic closure was nice..... it just didn't have all the features I wanted so returned it.
4.0,"Update on my previous review - the charging function works fine with some USB devices attached, such as flash drives or cameras, just doesn't work with an external USB HDD that needs power from the USB port.  So I'm giving it an extra star."
3.0,I got the packages and the lengths are correct but ITS NOT TEAL. It's GREEN. This disappointed me but overall the quality is great
1.0,Mine didn't work
1.0,"They don't work well at all. The plug into the phone doesn't catch the signal, so I have spent the weeks that I've had them trying trying to find a sweet spot so the phone actually charges. I finally gave up the other day and bought a cord from Rite Aid."
2.0,Cheap junk!
3.0,Excellent case rendering great protection for your laptop.
5.0,Good product
4.0,"Bright and work well, no dimmer switch"
4.0,I love it
4.0,I found this to be a interesting choice in the world of electronic thingies. At 2.5&#34; it is bigger then a 2&#34; yet smaller then a 3&#34;. It has 512GB which is more then the 511GB model but less then the 513GB model. It is the 850 Pro which is better then the 850 Semi-Pro. I feel the little red accent on the front of this adds a nice touch of color. I did the drop test on this dropping it on my pillow from 4.35 inches and it did no damage at all showing some nice quality. Would of been 5 stars if there were a little more of the red highlights on the front like a red star or a red smile face. Thank you very very much for reading my review boys and girls.
3.0,Because of it's small foot print the layout didn't work for me.  I had a hard time with placement of the keys.  I ended up returning it and getting the normal size keyboard instead.
3.0,"I needed to replace my Kindle Fire, since mine was having issues with the charging port and I was told it would be almost as expensive to fix it as to replace it.  My old Kindle was a 7 inch, but I thought a 6 inch would be just as good, just more pages.  I was wrong.  The print on the 6 inch Kindle is much smaller than the print on the 7 inch.  I wish it had the same size print but with more pages.  If and when I replace this one, it will definitely be at least a 7 inch."
1.0,"really if there is  less one star  i have to give you  guys ,  your product is a very bad product ,  the flash  give different sizes each time i plug it in, when i format it  it wont work anymore , i contact you  and  you just ignore me , any one want to buy this product  please do not ."
2.0,"I tried to install this on my T420, but it was too wide. It actually overlaps the sides creating a ridge when trying to mouse over the edges. Seems to stick okay, but it's no use if it doesn't fit properly!"
4.0,Sounds great..
4.0,"Fantastic computer for the price that I picked it up for. The description stated that it was a scratch and dent , but in all honestly it took 3 hours of looking HARD to find the 1/4 .in scratch . This was the best computer I have had ever, however the only problem is the mouse pad on this laptop. The mouse pad buttons on this computer are flushed so there is not visual, or felt indicator of left click right click. So if you are to far to the right on the clicker area you will get the right click drop down menus. Other than that the computer runs great"
1.0,You cannot swap out the hard drive without sending it back to HP. It took customer support and hour of lies to avoid telling me this.
2.0,"The product arrived on time and appeared to be the same one pictured.<br />1.)The biggest issue is that the clear portion of the screen protector was designed very poorly by morons who were unaware or did not care what the actual touch screen size is. You cannot access the drop down menu by swiping the top of the screen, you can't access notifications, clock, etc. AT ALL, you cannot access the quick side menu that allows you to return home or to another open app, and if your apps have any need to you to swipe from the edge of the screen, forget about it. This case is nice if you're going to watch a video and not touch the screen. If you want a protector that allows you to have a protected, functional and usable fire tablet, this is NOT the one for you. It was clearly designed by idiots who did not even check their product specifications to see how much of the touch screen has to be visible in order to use your tablet at all.<br />2.) Don't fool yourself though, this isn't 100% waterproof. I dropped the tablet into a sink with water into it while reading a recipe, did NOT fully submerge the tablet, and while the tablet functions, the inside of the case was dripping wet. If I hadn't opened the case quickly and aired out the tablet, who knows what kind of water damage, mold, mildew might have ensued.<br />3.) The casing around the speakers muffles the sound so it is barely audible at full volume, and actually buzzes a lot louder than the sound you are trying to hear. Again, some genius product engineers at work here, can't even make a speaker cover that doesn't buzz louder than your music.<br />Overall, I would NOT buy this product again. I recommend you look elsewhere. If what you're looking for is a protective case that will protect your device from water and drops AND leave your device functional enough for even casual use, this is NOT the product for you.<br />The only way the company could possibly adjudicate this issue would be to redesign the case with more competent engineers and provide a free new design model to everyone who threw away their money on a case that renders their touchscreen edge useless, fails to protect from A HALF INCH of water, and renders their speakers unusable. Anything short of providing a free redesigned product would be highway robbery. Don't buy this. Do yourself a favor."
5.0,This micro card has been seamless and simple to use.  The phone has not had any problems with this card.
4.0,Great item. Look stronger than the one I previously had. Definitely recommend this item
4.0,"Works as advertised - solid product, great price."
2.0,It was too cheap and it did not work. Tossed it.
4.0,Returned with no issues. No problems with memory. Person gave me wrong information as these were wrong type.
1.0,"im so upset right now it just died , turned on my phone and all my movies pics music all gone. card just died after three months bullcrap."
5.0,Great chip for the old days.
1.0,Too mushy.... Doesn't hold I pad in place!
2.0,you get what you pay for
3.0,The product met my expectations (I expected it would go in my S3.) That's about all there is to say.
5.0,I bought this for my Go Pro and it works as intended. The video records properly with no choppiness or other defects.
4.0,"Used in GoPro as other user reviews indicated the 32 and 64 GB cards did not work well.  Just buy more of them, I recorded over 1000 photos and 60 minutes of video on each 16GB card."
3.0,This product looks good. The only thing I don't like is its a bit harder to type on it because the silicone over the keys seem to be a bit loose. But it may be something I can get used to.
1.0,0 Out of 3 worked for more than a day. DO NOT RECOMMEND! All 3 cables failed within24 hours.
3.0,"Almost everything about this speaker seems quite good. 3 stars because I just received this today, folded up the charging port flap and charged it. When I try to snap the flap back where it belongs it doesn't stay down. Looks like the rubber is torn where it is supposed to fold. I can't see how this won't happen to every one of them in time, making it not waterproof anymore. Don't know if it was like this before or if it happened the one time I folded it up but not very happy."
4.0,"I like this product as it works very well. At first it only showed but when I plugged my camera using this micro-sdhc into my laptop and seen that this card had 2 partitions on it, I had to chose the correct one to use, otherwise I couldn't take many pictures or videos."
3.0,"I dropped the iPad in this case onto carpet-- a medium fall. The case broke, but at least the iPad didn't! You can't choose the angle, and you can't have the iPad propped up without the keyboard there (like to watch TV). I was kinda glad it broke because I was pretty tired of it."
5.0,"It's a little more than SanDisk's slow 16GB microSDHC, but cheaper than some other brands, and it works.Writes are a bit slow when the card fills up, but that's endemic to all SD cards, and it's not as bad as some other cards."
4.0,Works great for power and data. Only issues is that they are not as sturdy as I would have expected and one broke quickly.
4.0,"I bought my stepdaughter a Galaxy phone, and I didnt want to spend the extra money to upgrade her phone from 16gb. This was cheap and works fine."
5.0,Great headset
2.0,It's not a bad key board. But when your playing games for me I like have to really push down on the keys for them to work.  I means it's not a bad key board. But I would buy a different one if I could.
5.0,"Prompt delivery, and product works fine."
4.0,"Great laptop for the price. Bought it for college so I can leave my desktop during breaks and settle with a laptop that can at least run LoL when I want to play something.<br />Pros: Good specs for the price<br />Cons: The touch pad is dreadful. I immediately went to buy a wireless mouse the moment I had the time to. The mouse pointer would sometimes just move away when I'm about to left click something. The battery life of the laptop also leaves something to be desired since when I'm in class using only Microsoft Word and looking up papers online, the battery would drain about 40% an hour (20% in power saving mode). The preinstalled Windows 8.1 also comes with a bunch of bulkware that fills up half of the bottom bar but you can have all of it removed once you get a free upgrade to Windows 10 which seems to have some compatibility issues with the Windows 10 software for this specific laptop on the Acer website."
1.0,"s***ty! it did not work to my keyboard, it is a piece of s***! If there is a negative 10 star, i'd rate it that!"
3.0,It came quickly even though there was a delayed. ..I purchased this used but very good....Unfortunately it looked VERY....used and dirty...but seems to work so far.
5.0,"I bought this to put into a wifi enabled USB flash drive. It works fine. I can get my entire CD collection on it, which was my goal."
2.0,"Actually only 4-ports, one is a feed! One of the ports was DOA, so actually only 3 remaining."
1.0,"This does not appear to work with the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It worked for a few weeks, then my phone started giving me ""Unexpected Unmounted SD Card"" error messages.  After a bit of searching, people seem to agree that the S3 and Sandisk micro SD cards do not work together."
3.0,Its nice but the standing is no to scure.
5.0,"This hub works flawlessly.  I have been very pleased with my AmazonBasics purchases and this hub is no exception.  Many of the hubs in this price range are USB 2, and some don't even have a power adapter.  An unpowered hub is a waste of money and more aggravation than it is worth.  It is rare that a single computer USB port will have enough power for 4 devices at the same time.  The added advantage of having USB 3 makes this an ideal accessory, especially since most computers have only a single USB 3 port."
1.0,"Continuous panic crashs on Mac mimi.  Had to return, but they did give a full refund."
3.0,Its a nice tablet but I was disappointed to see that they deliberately made using Chromecast impossible
3.0,"I find this card seems to frequently stop working altogether and have to be reformatted, or simply re-seated. It's hard to know if this is the fault of the device I use it in (a cellphone), or the card itself, so I can't really hold that against it, but all I can say is that's been my experience with this card, and not others."
5.0,Great brand and excellent price. I purchased this for my Lenovo IdeaTab A2109 tablet. The adapter comes in handy when I need to use for a standard SD slot.
4.0,good product
2.0,They're 40 dollar stickers. Thats all.
3.0,decent but the company will spam you to death begging for a review.
4.0,Great so for
2.0,Too short to fit properly in my Dell XPS mounting cage. Only two screw holes could be used.
1.0,"The laptop worked ok for about one week,  except for the touch pad, which was glitching. A message popped up that I needed to allow some updates so I did.  Then it tried to update and now it will not do anything. The screen states &#34;failure configuring windows features reverting changes do not turn off your computer&#34;. This has not changed all day, I have waited 6 hours. It's a bit frustrating because I have school assignments due in a couple days!"
5.0,wasnt what i wanted but was refunded if would have work on my xbox im sure it would have been great
2.0,"Surprisingly this drive actually corrupted several image files in-between use. It has always been ejected correctly before removal too. Only used a couple of times to move files between laptops too. It does not inspire confidence as is. Fortunately, I had backups on a HDD of those corrupted images. I expect more from Sony with their branding on these products. The down side with Sony branded goods is you usually pay more for them than comparably featured items. I have had better luck with off-brand drives. The keyword here is &quot;luck&quot;. Not what you want to be confined to when using a drive considered reliable. Maybe I should have considered the expense of this flash drive? It was pretty inexpensive given the capacity. In this case I may have received what I paid for; a so-so product that was fairly inexpensive. Sorry Sony, only 3 stars.  [[ASIN:B00KJGYV2I Sony 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive (USM32X/B)]]"
2.0,Overpriced piece of equipment.
2.0,I sold it to a friend.  I prefer the nook format.  The Kindle is to nook as the i-phone is to android.  Too many rules.
2.0,Unfortunately this comes with no stand so it isn't as pictured. It didn't pick up my voice at all no matter what I did with the switch. A totally useless purchase for me.
4.0,"I bought these microSDXC cards for use in my tablet, however, my tablet only recognizes FAT32 formatted cards and not the exFAT that these cards use. I had suspicions about this based upon other reviewers' experiences. Windows computers will not reformat in FAT32 beyond the 32 GB limit. I was able to locate a small program that would reformat a drive to FAT32 without the 32GB limitation (FAT32 can accommodate up to a 3 TB drive). I used the Windows GUI version of fat32format (freeware) and it quickly reformatted the memory card. Now the card works in my tablet."
1.0,"This product is defective as well. To much trouble trying to have to return things. Hard earned cash payed. then when it doesn't work the hassle of getting refunded sucks. I still have it however, the product let me down because it came from overseas. Followed charging procedure that came with the product It never held a charge as a new product. Still have it but un-usable."
3.0,"OK, I want to write this reviews to tell your the truth. I love thinkpad and I do not mean not to by thinkpad, I have received it for half a month, and I find some problem about this item! 1. The SSD in this laptop is a very cheap one and it is a primary product! So the voice will be more louder than other laptop'And also because of this problem, the computer will heat hot very quickly! 2. When I put my computer in the table, it is not stable. The 4 fulcrum is not in the same level. I don't believe it. So I put it in  absolute horizon vibration isolated table, it is still not stable.  3. I really not satisfied with the screen about this item. It is really a bad screen. I asked them how to solve this problem and they do not give the reply! 4.The lip of this computer can not be closed tight"
3.0,"This thing is super loud. I don't know, maybe I'm just used to my SSD. But yeah whenever this drive is accessed it is very noisy. My friend has the Blue version and it is very quiet and performance wise, I didn't really see any difference. I kind of regretted buying this one over the WD blue. if the blue came with more than 1TB I would've returned this one right away, but meh."
3.0,I got the warranty a month before I got the product. One would think you would start the warranty upon delivery of the product. Makes no sense to me.
3.0,"I bought this because I recently bought a 13.3 laptop that is super thin. I wanted something sleek and compact that would fit into a laptop sleeve without the bulk of a traditional mouse. The concept is good, but it freezes while trying to use it. For me, it's a little too aggravating. I'll be on the lookout for something more reliable. Probably going to return this one - even though it was a pretty good price."
2.0,"The cars seemed great, but occasionally the card is suddenly &#34;not formatted&#34;, even without writing new data to it. Has happened in multiple devices.I lost some video I can't rerecord on it, and am fairly upset.Some forums say that the early runs of these cards did that occasionally and that it has been fixed on new runs, but I find it difficult to trust them now. I have never had this problem with any SanDisk product before, including the 5 of these cards I have in 32GB.Very disappointed."
4.0,Works fine
5.0,&#34;Very nice product for the price&#34;
3.0,"Had to return - like another reviewer, colors did not seem accurate (everything with BenQ always appears too orange.) Would not recommend for Photoshop or other graphics work."
3.0,its a printer cord if it does its job then its worth it...although I really think it should come with the printer and not be sold separate.
3.0,It was fine and is doing the job it was purchased for.
5.0,"It's tiny,.. in size, - but provides great storage. Tested and works great with all our BlackBerry Z10 - and Q10 devices.. Just remember to format the memorycard by using the Setup on the phone ... and NOT format using your computer.."
1.0,CORD DOES NOT WORK.  Tried plugging it into two different plug bases and also directly to the computer.  Not compatible with Nook HD.
2.0,When you set it up on the long angle camera does not line up with hole in the case
4.0,works
5.0,Amazing. I'm getting 15mbps faster just from replacing my cox router. I'm in love with this routers design as well. I paired it with the surfboard modem. Thank you TP-Link!
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my dad, who has never used a tablet before.  The price is definitely right.  The storage is good for the price, and is easily upgraded with an SD card.  The tablet came with a charger and a screen protector.  Before we could get that on, the screen got scratched.  That was ridiculous.  So put your screen guard on first thing, because it scratched really easily from some sand on the table.  The camera is weak, but for $50, I wasn't expecting the best in the world.  I was sad that there wasn't a flash on it.  So far, he's enjoying the tablet and I'm enjoying him learning about newer technologies.  Thanks!"
1.0,doesn't hold much of a charge....hate it
2.0,"Horrible, the laptop is damaged beyond repair, I didn´t drop it or got it wet, it just stopped displaying image..."
3.0,"There seems to be no review for 16&#34; version, so this must be the first one.<br />There have been many reviews on the quality, so I'll skip that part and focus on the size.<br />The dimension is 16x11x4. I've seen in Q&A that 14&#34; version's dimension is 15x11x4, so 16&#34; version is just &#34;slightly&#34; bigger than 14&#34; one.<br />The dimension exactly reflects its capacity.<br />My 14&#34; Dell latitude laptop barely fit in the laptop compartment, but velcro strap doesn't close. I'm pretty that sure any laptop even slightly bigger than this won't fit. I tried 15.6&#34; Dell inspiron into it, but, obviously, it didn't fit. I could squeeze it into the main compartment though.<br />In short, you cannot assure your 16&#34; laptop fit into this bag, which is advertised to be able to fit 16&#34; laptop.<br /><br />Overall quality is fine, but there are some other things I'd like to point out.<br />1. Attaching shoulder strap is hell. It's almost impossible to attach it with bare hands.<br />2. There's no tag or manual that I could make sure it's really 16&#34; version, or even if it is new product.<br />3. Shoulder strap is not really padded. I thought it's well padded based on customer images.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
5.0,Great product! came with an adapter to plug into a camera or a regular sized card reader. The ultra allows for faster uploads and downloads onto the card!  Great for pictures and apps!
1.0,"Drive worked for a year and failed. Lost all my information on it, not happy. Sad that my ancient IDE drive works longer than an SSD."
2.0,"The directional pad and the media buttons should be swapped. That makes it kind of uncomfortable. Also two of my keys take more pressing to activate. Aside from that, it works and at good distance."
3.0,"Plastic shines up really bad after minimal use, you have to wipe it down frequently.  My Deathadder never had that issue.  Mouse works great, CUE software leaves a lot to be desired, be sure to read the forums about lighting issues before you commit to this mouse if you are excited about the RGB features.  Also, if you don't need it right away... WAIT.  They are changing the logo back to the sailing ship and getting rid of this hideous tramp stamp.  Hold out until they release the new version with the old logo.  Once they do that, I will be buying another one of these."
2.0,good
1.0,"Why I bought it: I enjoy how light weight it is. The price is a bargain. The platform allows it to run Microsoft.<br /><br />Why I can't use it: The memory is so small that it cannot run Microsoft 10, Microsoft Office, and a Web browser. As a result, I uninstalled Microsoft Office to make room for the newestimate upgrade, but now I cannot re-install it."
1.0,DON'T BUY IT.  THE TABLET DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY TO WORK.  I HAD AT&T PUT IN A NEW ROUTER AND THIS DID NOT HELP AT ALL.  PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT.. YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF FOR IT. GET A TABLE THAT HAS MORE MEMORY.
3.0,"Ordering my 2nd one. My original took a hit for the team and absorbed nearly all the damage from dropping the MBP retina. It landed on a corner. The KUZY bottom case cracked but keep the MPB from getting seriously dented.<br /><br />Yes, I'm getting another!<br /><br />The only downside of the case is that its little rubber feet tend to fall off over time. They are so small, you don't realize until you notice that the case seems wobbly on a flat surface."
3.0,"Easy to put the Kindle in, difficult to take it out. I spent a good few minutes trying to pry the Kindle out of the case. I believe the case cracked in the process. So I suppose it's good in the sense that the Kindle is very securely in there and is not at risk of slipping out whatsoever. But I'm still disappointed that the case cracked on the edge. I've had it for less than a month and have never dropped my device. I noticed the crack a few days after attempting to remove the Kindle from the case. Nothing else happened that could explain the crack. Everything else about the case is fine. The magnet keeps the lid closed effectively and also locks/unlocks the Kindle. It's thin and light, making everything easy to carry around. A case simply shouldn't crack in the process of removing the device it is intended to protect. Shouldn't be a problem for most people though, since there is very little reason to take the Kindle out once you put it in the case (I removed mine to get at some dust that fell into the cracks)."
3.0,we needed repair upon arrival . the fan was making REALLY LOUD SOUND.
5.0,"I just got windows 10, so finally had a reason to use a microphone for other than gaming for which I can use my headset's mic. I just like telling Cortana things to do, mic picks up sound pretty well."
5.0,"Using this for expanded storage on my Nexus 7 (via Mini SD USB Reader for Android) and it's working great. Instantly adds more storage for music, movies, tv, etc..."
1.0,screen was inferior. you can see the lines in screen when you turn on laptop
3.0,"Missing the 3rd pin on one of the two outputs<br />When i got it, one of the 2 pwm outputs was missing the 3rd pin and so with some testing, i was able to move the 4th pin to the 3rds place. it was really strange to why one of the pins just didnt exist but since i dont have any pwm fans, it was a quick fix and works. In short, im sure it wasnt a design flaw, it was just maybe a quality oversight still recommend and dont need to return it :D"
1.0,It doesn't work.
4.0,Upgraded from a 550ti and there was a HUGE difference in performance. Its a good step up if you don't want or can't invest in the 900s yet.
4.0,Just what I needed. I want to hold my Ipad on a table to play music for a family get together and this will work great.
3.0,"Okay. Let me start off by saying that the blue pictured is either incorrect, or they sent me the wrong case. It's not a bad color, but it's not the color I wanted, and I'm disappointed about that. I'm looking for a way to contact Fintie so I can ask them to update their product photo so as to not mislead others. That, on top of the package getting lost, then arriving several days past the estimated delivery date, has me pretty cranky about using it. Now, on to the case itself... You get what you pay for with this case. My paperwhite fits fine, but it feels like a drop will eject the case's occupant instead of protect it. (For obvious reasons, I haven't tested this.) It's not the lightest case I've used, but it feels much lighter than the Amazon-brand case this one resembles. The magnet closure is weak. I'll have to find a way to mod it and make it stronger, but I don't have much faith in its ability to keep shut when my purse is jostled. It's not a bad case though.   Update June 6 2016: The case has grown on me, I guess, because I'm considering buying a second from Fintie. After a slight modification (Elastic to hold the case closed, hahaha) the case has held up to general wear and tear. I'm considering a second for the color change -- still not a fan of the color I received, and I'd like a change."
3.0,"I purchased these headphones specifically for the color combination as a gift for my brother. The headphones I received in the mail were blue and black and, after contacting Amazon, I was informed that Amazon Prime does not ship the yellow and gray headphones. I got refunded for half the price and kept the headphones. My brother was kind of disappointed, but they're good headphones and good quality - just not as advertised.<br /><br />Remember, if you don't have a port for the headphones and a mic, you'll need to get an adapter. This works well with the adapter we purchased with no problem."
3.0,"It can run basic games, a bit disappointed it can't run Wow on a decent spec."
3.0,"Seems like a good value, but as yet i've not gotten to actually use mine;I bought it for a Contour+ camera without realizing that was apparently known to be incompatible. Found that out afterward on Contour's forum. The device itself will support microSD up to 64GB but there is something about Sandisk Ultras that doesn't play nicely. Unclear what, exactlySo I'm sure it's great, but you might want to check around to make sure your device will support the thing."
2.0,It works when it wants to.
1.0,Did not want
2.0,Not as expected
3.0,fits everything and works for what I needed it for. The only thing I question is why there's a fan opening on the bottom and not much open space between the case and the floor for airflow? I ended up turning it upside down. WIll probably upgrade before considering adding a second video card.
2.0,"seems slow, using it with my car's head unit, and this one seems to take longer to read then full size USB's"
5.0,Works great and price was not too bad either. Worked perfect with out having to format it. Transfer rate was fast when I loaded 20 movies and 9 GB of musice and 2 GB of pictures all at the same time. It took a total of 30 min. probably because I had multiple transfers at same time but works great for my new bought Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Thanks
5.0,Is there any thing else that needs to be said?This was put into a Samsung S3. The card worked and has worked so far w/o any hick-ups. Price was very good too here on amazon.
3.0,Feels really cheap. Literally feels like cardboard. The packaging was lame as heck too.
1.0,This computer battery life is terrible.  Even when new.  Lasts about 45 minutes.  It also gets extremely hot.  Something is wrong with the design and choice of microprocessor.  And when it is not the performance suffers considerably.  Don't know if they are still available but don't buy this computer.
5.0,Love this SD Card. I have had such great results from it. I could not be happier with it. Love the price I was able to get this for. I have bought them before and will probably buy more. I don't think I will ever buy anything but the ULTRA series sd cards.
5.0,It is fast and a great deal. You wont need anything bigger than this unless you are downloading tons of movies on your phone. it does its job quite well.
2.0,"Bought the Archer C9 from Amazon and returned it the following day. It has good reviews and all, but didn't work for me. Router was fast nearby, but at 40 ft, it was dropping the signal, and about 50 ft away from it, my devices couldn't find the router. I tried relocating it to a more open area, positioning the antennas at different angles and directions, but didn't help. It pretty much had the same range as my 6 year-old Linksys router that doesn't have any exterior antennas. I was very disappointed. Too bad, it was a nice looking router."
2.0,Bought this for my 5 year old son. Worked ok for the first game he played however within 2 minutes of starting to take pictures the tablet froze up and I could not even turn it off.  The tablet got very hot while waiting for the battery to die then I charged it and seemed like it was fine until he took a picture then the same thing happened!!! Fortunately I was able to return
3.0,"Wish the ribbon cable was longer.  Wish the focal point was closer.  I was trying to get it to view my 3d printout as it was happening, however, it needs to be further away, in which case, no detail is shown."
3.0,didn't need it.
5.0,Perfect. Just what I needed.
1.0,Had to exchange because the battery stopped charging fully. Now. the replacement only only charges 80%
5.0,Amazing how much stuff you can save on this little card.  SanDisk has always been reliable and I would recommend it.  Amazon seems to have the best prices.
4.0,"...to have both the micro and the adapter in the same package. I only had to buy ONE package to get the items I needed for my Smartphone and my digicam.  I replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one, then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera, then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapter.I would have given it 5 stars, but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months! Truthfully, though, I don't know if it's because the product is defective, or if I just handled it too much or incorrectly. So I feel 4 stars is fair."
4.0,Very large.  13&#34; wide x 11&#34; deep. But seems good so far.
4.0,"Fits macbook 13&#34; nicely. Have to get used to the grip surface as typing is not as easy. Also, keep in my the piece muffles the speaker as most of the sound comes out of the spaces in the keyboard. However, the protection is the most important part, so it's a very good product."
5.0,Five star
4.0,"Generally a good laptop.  The SSD makes the initial boot-up faster.  I currently have an issue with a down cursor key that periodically sticks (laptop arrived only 3 weeks ago).  I am in the processing of trying to get that problem resolved via warranty through an authorized Lenovo repair partner; if that won't solve the problem quickly, I may have one of their tech guys come to my house to fix the problem, which is most likely a keyboard replacement.  Not crazy about going that route as it will cost me $50 to have the tech guy come to my house even though the keyboard replacement is free.<br /><br />Wish the keyboard was backlit and the screen resolution was higher.  Other small annoying issues but with Windows 10 and Edge that on my old laptop with a lower Internet Explorer I did not experience (e.g. PDF files that won't open or even if they open, not able to print unless I save the file first) All in all, not a bad laptop.  May think about a gaming laptop next time to maintain the speed and better resolution."
2.0,"I bought this large capacity hard drive in April 2013. In August 2015 it failed. Fortunately, it failed just slowly enough that I was able to get one last backup copy onto an external 4GB drive. Just 3 days after this backup, the drive no longer shows up on my Mac. I can't even format it - it's just gone.<br /><br />Hard drives are expected to last more than 2.5 years, so I can't recommend this to anyone. I'm going to replace it with a Toshiba drive and hope that one lasts longer"
3.0,It's hard to adjust but works. It doesn't fit well if you have your iPad in a protected case. I don't know but others but I want mt expensive ipad in a case for knock over reasons.
2.0,"There are compatibility issues that are not mentioned. It states it is for a XBOX 360 but not that it is 1 of a series of 4 that could potentially be the same as the one in your XBOX, also that you have to either flash your XBOX or remove the circuit from the DVD drive of the old and new and swap them, which could consist of soldering."
1.0,This is total crap. It should have negative stars. It is fake and put my computer into seizures as it tried to reconcile with the graphics card. Thank god I tried it the day before I needed to use it so I could go to an Apple store and get the real deal.
1.0,The product I purchased was too big for my computer. This is the second shell I got that was too big.
1.0,Just not good quality.  It was scratched very easily - I threw it away and bought ArmorShield instead.
3.0,It wasn't compatible with my iPhone 6.
5.0,What can I say it is a sandisk (not a knock off) and it works great.  Never buy one that is faster than the max speed of your device or you will be throwing away money.  (or just call it future proofing it for your next device but who knows what we will be using then)
2.0,"It's junk. I thought I was getting a good deal. It doesn't hold my iPad up, and the plastic edges are rough. The lid does not stay put when you turn it upside down."
4.0,"This is not an HP branded replacement, it is generic. However, unlike many other generic chargers on here, this one is of good quality.<br /><br />You can tell it's not super cheap as it has a decent weight to it. The cord has held up for over 6 months now, and I would probably buy this again."
1.0,This thing works only half the time. If that. Junk.
5.0,I needed a nice and flawlessly working tablet at an reasonable price. But I'm glad to have it as a sample for my fair review. I've to say this is the tablet I was looking for. It has great display and has a very responsive touch. I love playing my favorite games on it and al runs smoothly. This is surely my smoothest gaming experience I've ever had.
2.0,"The tablet arrived quickly & seemed sturdy but would not connect to Google. Three attempts to reset system with no luck. Poor tech support... 24 hr wait just to be told via email they needed more information :( I don't know about you, but I want to be up and running right away. Sorry...it's not a keeper."
1.0,"Worked great for the first month. Afterwards product refused to turn on. Yes,I did try replacing the batteries. Never ordering 'tecknet' products again."
4.0,One of the largest USB drives I have used and it performs quickly and efficiently
3.0,I bought this cover for the stand up feature which works well.  The only issue I have is that the cover does not stay in place when closed. I  carry my Kindle in a purse and sometimes find it glowing because the cover moved.  I'll use for a while but will buy the $40 leather cover which stays shut
5.0,Great purchase! with the best price on the market so far. I appreciate the fact that this product came ready to use and very well packaged. Please let me know if you have a thumb drive with built in security at a very low price. Money is tight but the product is worth the investment.
5.0,Needed this to be able to update my Garmin with Canada and Europe maps. Did the job and at a great price.
2.0,This thing is flimsy. It can barely hold the weight of an iPad Air 2.<br />It is not worth buying. Spend the extra money for something better. Like maybe three twigs from your backyard tied together with shoelaces.
2.0,"I have owned two flips. The first was the 4gb model which I had to send back because after one week it started having keyboard problems. I then ordered a 2gb model and had to send it back because one speaker was out. I have always had very good luck with ASUS equipment. However, my experience with the flip has been much less than what I have come to expect with ASUS. Other than that it is a neat little chromebook but I am now waiting for the equivalent Acer model due out this fall."
1.0,Broke right away
4.0,I ordered two one me and one for me daughter.  We both are very pleased.  The only complaint we both have is the speaker is on the back of device instead of the front so when you stream movies it makes it more difficult to hear.
2.0,This Case began to fall apart after a couple of weeks of light use. The keyboard guides are bonded to the base.  The glue started to separate from the guides very quickly.
1.0,"This remote is not very good! It has a few problems with the layout like the position of the mouse buttons which are all the way at the top and makes it hard to use them accurately. The fly mouse is very unreliable, every time the curser goes over anything that could be clicked on to be chosen it stops responding and it's a pain to get it to move again. The ir feature is nice if you want to control your av system and tv but I bought this to control my kodi box and the control has failed horribly. It wasn't even able to turn the box on or off so I had to program my box on the tv button so I could power it on and off same thing with volume. The big thing that made this a 1 star for me is the air mouse and how it gets stuck also the awkwardness of the buttons. Maybe someone else can get used to this but it is hard to press that button and not move the mouse while doing it and then having to try again."
3.0,I was expecting ore protection for the Ipad. Ther is none. It is clamped onto the keyboard.The keyboard works very well.
2.0,I guess it technically does hold a 17 in. laptop but not comfortably by any means. It's so tight I really would say that it didn't. Only reason I didn't send it back was because we were in the middle of moving and I had other things to worry about.
5.0,"Very fast sd card, I really use it for emulators on the Nvidia Shield and it does the job right. I have no complaints everything is in order and i would recommend."
3.0,"I like the protection, but it's kind of bulky"
5.0,Haven't really used it
3.0,I have two of these and use them for my Galazy Note 2. It's great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your 'phablet'.So far they have done what they are intended to do.
5.0,a class 10 micro sd with 32 gd and san disk...its great! no problems so far and is suiting my needs quite nicely!
2.0,"PROS:<br />Cheap laptop, good hard drive space (500 GB), large screen, works well if all you need is internet access to check/send email and casually browse websites. I would buy this laptop for my mother if she needed one - because all she does is send/check emails and &#34;Likes&#34; my Facebook posts :)<br /><br />CONS:<br />Windows 8.1, loaded with bloatware (like an insane amount), has one USB port on the left side, the remaining two are located in the back (WTF?), the headphone jack is also located in the back.... middle back.... (WTF?!), so when I plug in head phones the cord is extremely short and my face needs to be extremely close to the screen (very uncomfortable), no CD drive (isn't this standard with almost every other laptop manufactured?), while the screen is large the quality isn't great (watching YouTube videos on 720p is pretty much the same as watching it in 480), don't even try gaming on this laptop.... by &#34;gaming&#34; I mean not even Facebook gaming (powered by FLASH)... slowest sh*t you will ever go through, and just to throw in - the built in camera has AWFUL quality (unusable in daylight AND lowlight).<br /><br />Good laptop for any person that is not computer savvy AT ALL, a student that needs to type papers and do minimal web based research for said papers<br /><br />I'm keeping mine as a backup to my backup... and because I received it as a gift and didn't pay a dime for it."
3.0,Been using it at work. No problems in the few weeks I've used it.
4.0,"Ports are buggy sometimes, but either than that it's pretty good overall."
1.0,"This was a waste of my money, it didn't fit.  It was for my daughters school issued computer.  I purchased one last year and it fit just fine.... If you have a chormebook don't buy this item, you'll be sorry.  Because the school was late in issuing the computers, I missed the return deadline, $20 wasted...."
2.0,"It is not as fast as advertised, I have high sopeed internet and it is about the same as my past computer."
2.0,Ordered it for a wireless speaker and it didn't work.
5.0,"Fast, reliable, good brand name and customer service, top of line product. One thing to note is if you don't have a high end device then you don't need a class 10, a class 4 or 6 will yield you the same results. So keep that in mind."
1.0,Under Windows 8.1 it could only see the 2.4 band.  When I upgraded to Windows 10 it became a brick. If I figure out a fix I will update this.  UPDATE: Still no improved driver that I can find... still a W10 brick.
2.0,Can't get a driver to work with windows 8.1. I didn't get any paper work with it.
5.0,"This SanDisk class 10 microSDHC is installed in my phone and works great. As always, SanDIsk lives up to its name."
2.0,"Fits snugly...then falls apart. Didn't even get a chance to put the iPad in to test it before the joint that holds the swivel portion on fell off and the screw, washer, and other hardware fell all over the floor of the car."
2.0,"The two Inspirons I have bought -- in 2009 and 2015 -- have been a disapointment.  My X8700 I bought in February performs indifferently.  And like the older Inspiron, the hard drive failed within a few months of my purchasing it.  (Interestingly, the Dell monitor has similar plug-in problems to the one I also bought 6 years ago -- Dell doesn't seem to be fixing their defects.  Meanwhile, if your hard drive fails you are on your own.  You can spend extra $$$ on extra warrantees, and you still have to jump through all the hoops and be without a computer for weeks."
5.0,Received my card in a decent amount of time and it was packaged well . The memory card was crispy brand new and in perfect condition . After installing the card in my video camera it worked perfectly! Very good deal.
2.0,ITS OK I DONT USE IT I BOUGHT IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE IN MY OFFICE
4.0,It does what it's suppose to - protects the tablet.
2.0,"This ran very well for about 14 months, no problems with the computer concerning power and the noise lever, while higher than the original HP model, was fine. But at 14 months, it became VERY loud, for no discernible reason. It was so loud that sitting at the computer became almost intolerable and would even drown out the TV in the next room."
1.0,This cord does not fit the HP envy sleekbook model specified and is not HP brand as indicated in the listing. Cheap knockoff made in China.
2.0,This product did not fit the HP Envy 360 2 in 1 15.6&#34; touch screen computer.
4.0,So far I'm really enjoying my new case. It fits my 13&#34; Mac perfectly. Where each handle is located is just big enough for the plug on one side and my phone in the other. I would have preferred a zipper pocket but I haven't had any trouble with my plug or phone sliding out of the pockets so I'm happy. I love the print. It's a canvas like material.  I'm a bit concerned how well it can be cleaned. Oh the inside is lined with a fuzzy material that protects my Mac nicely. Overall great purchase for the money :)
2.0,Barely extended our range.
5.0,I was using a basic memory card in my Samsung Note 3 and when I took a picture it took forever for the phone to put it in the memory card and get ready for a new picture. Once I installed this Sandisk the transfer was almost non-existent. What a difference. Worth the few extra bucks.
5.0,"This is the second one of these chips that I received.  The first either had a latent physical defect or damage in transit, but it snapped in half on first use.  I was really bummed, but determined to try again.  This was a breeze!  The chip blazes, doubled the capacity of the 32 GB chip it replaced in my ASUS TF700T tablet, and holds ALL of my music and documents with plenty of room left over!  I now have 128 GB available on my tablet, and it all works flawlessly.Anyone that is looking to upgrade needs to do a little due diligence in determining that your device is able to address 64 GB's, but with that reservation, I strongly recommend this little gem!!"
3.0,"I've owned a number of tablets over the years.  Most recently the 2012 version of the Nexus 7.  I decided I wanted to go back to the larger 10.1&#34; size,  but wanted to keep the cost low.  After looking around,  reading reviews and specs,  I decided to go with the A10X.<br /><br />Anything written here has to take one thing into account,  and that is:  you get what you pay for.  I spent about $68 for the tablet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The price.<br />*The wifi is excellent.  I use it a lot for Netflix and Vudu and I'm very happy with the performance.<br />*Along with that,  the quad core A33 processor seems fast.  I have no complaints about what I've seen it do.<br />*Bluetooth works perfectly.  Connected to my headphones with ease.<br />*Though plastic,  it seems to be solidly made,  and is rather lightweight.<br />*A good size,  5000mAh battery.  I don't plug in the charger regularly,  and it's lasted me for a lengthy period.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The screen.  At 1020x600 pixels,  the colors and resolution are miserable.  Viewing angle are,  to put it nicely..... horrible.  Straight on,  the tablet picture isn't bad,  though again,  colors are fairly washed out.<br />*Compatibility.  I've tested some games and they work fine.  On the other hand,  I play The Simpsons: Tapped Out on my other tablet,  and it does nothing but force close on the A10X.  Very annoying.<br />*Charging is through a cable provided,  not the USB,  as with most tablets.  If something happens to the charger,  you can probably find another,  but not as convenient.<br /><br />Is this tablet a bad buy?  Not if you're looking for something that is very low price,  and does the basics.  For someone looking for a first time tablet,  you could find worse.  For a seasoned tablet owner,  you will probable find it lacking.<br /><br />One last note.  Please don't trust reviewers that say they got a review copy and are doing an honest review.  They're not."
2.0,Impractical and unnecessary. Sorry I bought it.
4.0,As advertised
2.0,"I read somewhere that the Kindle ran on the Android OS.  So I bought it during the Prime Day sale.  They actually use a customized version of Android OS, which they call Fire, and will not get you most of the cool apps that a regular android tablet will get you.  Basically this was a waste of money for me and I am glad I paid the Prime Day price, which was the most disappointing sale ever!!"
4.0,"I do like the keyboard.  It's very comfortable.  The mouse is great.  I enjoy the wireless capabilities on both, it works well for me.  I did expect the keyboard to be quieter.  I have to type extremely slow for it to be &#34;quiet&#34;, and I'm a fast typer.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, I just wish it was truly quiet."
3.0,Its good but its kind of hard to type and it gets dusty.
1.0,"After the first Key Power battery didn't hold a charge I emailed the company. They kindly send me a replacement battery.  My husband followed their instructions EXACTLY as Key Power had written them.  And when I say EXACTLY I mean EXACTLY- we wanted this battery to work. Sadly, this battery was worse than the first one I bought from them.  I rarely write one star reviews, but unfortunately this battery warrants it.  After a few month of having this battery my laptop now holds about 15 minutes worth of life.  My laptop now is pretty much tethered to the power cord- I should have stuck with my Apple battery and saved my $90."
1.0,Stopped working after 4 months real junk!!!!
4.0,It works well with Windows 10.
5.0,Work better than I expected.  Exactly what I needed.
3.0,it broke really easy😢
2.0,"I have had the Asus Transformer book for six months now, and I have been disappointed.  When it is working correctly, it's great, but it just doesn't work properly all the time.  The wi-fi is a huge problem.  It is constantly dropping my internet connection.  Since it is the only device in the house that does this, I know it is the machine and not my internet or router.  Several times a day, I have to disconnect from the wi-fi and reconnect again for the internet to work. It also doesn't connect easily to a home network for printing and such.  Charging is also iffy. Sometimes when I plug it in to the charger, it will work, but then sometimes it says &#34;plugged in, not charging.&#34; When I plugged an adapter into my micro-HDMI port, the computer completely shut down and would not turn back on until the next morning.  Sometimes the touch screen just decides to stop working too, and I have to restart the computer for that.  At the time I bought this, it was the only machine of its type at this price.  I'm beginning to think I should have saved up for something better."
1.0,"Got the SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A on December 28, 2012, died on May 20, 2013Could not write to it or change any data, no matter what device i used. Even after format (Full & Quick using disk manager & EaseUS Partition Master 9.1.1 Home Edition, connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor) when disconnected and reconnected no change. Dropbox saved my data luckily (Had it syncing using Dropsync Pro).Was using it with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 T889 for the whole time, never was removed."
2.0,"Wi-Fi is borderline unusable with Comcast, STAY AWAY!!!! Works great as a modem, I get download speeds over 100 mbps when I plug my ethernet directly into the device. Unfortunately, when I try to use the router functionality this device becomes completely useless. With my laptop directly next to the device and no other devices connected, I cannot get it to crack 5 mbps download. From my room about 10 feet away, I cannot crack 1 mbps. Seriously, just buy your modem and router separately, this device has horrible Wi-Fi features when used with Comcast. It's what I get for going cheap, buy higher quality modems/routers together in the future."
2.0,"This would be a pretty nice tablet for the money, if it didn't come with un-removable malware. The Ads interfere with your normal usage."
1.0,too slippery
2.0,"The cable seems to work only with an adapter and will not work with the Laptop's USB port. It goes from recognizing the device to unrecognizing the device while connected to the laptop. So, if you're out looking for a charging cable and needs to use the laptop USB port, this won't work. I've tried it with 2 different laptops and 1 macbook and that didn't work."
1.0,love it   im changing my review due to after I got it in September of 2015 me and the kids took it on vacation with us to use in the car. Well not even 3 day in to our trip the thing wont turn on. due to its been more then a month I try to contact the seller to get manufacturing info on the tablet still no response im really upset
3.0,"Just got it delivers today. Took it out of package and noticed a warped crease in all 3 pieces.  I've been wanting an anti glare protector eagerly so I thought I'd try apply one anyway and see if the dented part would flatten out.  It became an exercise in frustration.  The creased part did flatten out somewhat but not completely, there're still 2 small lines with air under that would t go away no matter what I try. There's also other bubbles that are difficult to get rid off.  I read other reviews saying it takes several tries to get it right so I thought I may get better luck the more I practice- that's why 3 pieces were provided. Well, I ended up using up all 3 pieces and still have some bubbles and the creases won't go away.  I tried using the s pen on it and it works fine, so that part is good.  However, I still need a replacement or refund, since the item came damaged. ===UPDATE============= After contacting the seller, I was told to place another order on amazon and the price will be refunded to me after sending them my order number. So they did stand beyond their replacement warranty.  This time the package was better.  I watched several youtube videos on how to apply screen protector this time and the result was more successful, with only one tiny bubble. It took me about an hour though.  I wish it was easier. So now I change the rating from one star to 3."
3.0,It is a good travel size. Microsoft replaced the traditional scroll wheel with touch strip. They did feel the need to make it feel like a clicking wheel when you scroll. Totally unnecessary! I thought something was broken in the mouse at first. The scrolling is not very consistent either. The page doesn't  move in unison with your finger movement. The bluetooth connection isn't great either. It will disconnect intermittently.
3.0,The split for the eat phones is small. Fits Kiss only.
3.0,"Drive is fine, not fast, but ok for the price."
3.0,"Seemed promising at first, as the hardware specs are quite impressive for the size and price, but I later paid for it 10x with the countless hours I wasted trying to load my own OS/kernel. The software support is nearly non-existent, and eventually had to refer to external sources for information, but still failed to get this paperweight to work as anything more. I am really tempted to give it a good review as to not screw myself out of selling it online.<br /><br />The only reason I give this 3 stars, is because I believe a lot of this _had_ to be due to my insufficient experience, or the fact that I even attempted to go outside of the box and try to load custom software on it.<br /><br />I ended up just using a raspberry pi, which was a walk–in–the–park by comparison.<br /><br />I still believe this device could be great for small projects like a router or IDS, but I didn't have enough time to hack it.<br />NO WAY would I trust this device for industrial/commercial use as other users have reported; I too had a problem with heat, and the hdmi interfaces were flaky to say the least."
3.0,"I did build a new computer recently. I was wondering if It would be okay if I install this to my new system because this one is much cheapar from the others. Thank god I had no problem with it so far. Thanks to Amazon.<br /><br />edit: After using it for a month, the ram having stability issues. My computer freezing out of nowhere. using this with Maximus 8 Ranger / i7 6700K.. I have ordered Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB."
3.0,"nice case, could have came with instructions on how to open it to put the kindle in"
1.0,"Worked for a few months and died, was good when worked<br />Disappointed 😞"
5.0,"I bought this modem router for our twins' condo at college. I wanted it to be compatible with their ultra current laptops required by their school of engineering, and I liked the idea of a combined cable modem and router from a convenience standpoint. Initially, during setup, I experienced problems in the setup, since I did not &#34;reset&#34; the unit first to factory specs. Since it was already used previously (I bought this as a used unit on Amazon.com at an excellent price), the former owner had set a unique log-in and password, and did not inform me what they were. But once I reset the box to factory specs, then the initial setup proceeded well and smoothly.<br /><br />After setup, one of my son's laptop was experiencing random disconnects from the internet which was very frustrating. The connection would come and go, and when it went, you would see a yellow exclamation mark on the internet icon in the task bar of the laptop screen in the lower right hand side. But then the laptop would just automatically reconnect to the internet again, and then the random disconnect process would begin again. The other son's laptop would lose connection to the wireless HP Officejet printer. In his case, we would have to &#34;reload&#34; the massive drivers again in his laptop over and over to get the connection reestablished, and then randomly, the problem would appear again. But his laptop (which is identical in model, hardware and specifications to the other son's) would never lose connection with the internet.<br /><br />After much diagnosis and stepwise problem solving, we realized that the sons were living in a high density student environment and that there were many separate internet networks active in the same building and nearby, with many of them operating on the same WiFi channels. In our location, these tended to be channels 11 and 6. Our own modem router defaulted to channel 11.<br /><br />This Arris modem router has a feature once you enter the program inside the modem router to fine-tune it, that allows you to conduct a channel scan of your environment, and allows you then to select a unique default channel other than 11, 6, or 1.  We chose channel 9 since no one else was using that channel. Once we did that, then the separate problems each of the two laptops were experiencing went away, and now the laptops have been continuously connected to both the internet and to the printer as well without dropouts.<br /><br />So, the takeaway we learned was to get to know our living environment well first, and then to fine-tune the WiFi operating channel  that would avoid competing channel traffic from surrounding networks in our location. Once we did that, our dropped internet connection and dropped printer WiFi connection problems went away.<br /><br />Setup with Comcast internet cable was easy and straightforward, and we were able to activate that modem router easily using the Comcast Xfinity set up program. It was straightforward and automatic, and we are now pleased overall with the Arris SBG6782-AC modem router!"
2.0,Worked once I was able to find a system to format it.Second card from SanDisk that was sent to me unformatted.They need to get their act together...
3.0,For the time being it works ok.
4.0,HAD TO ORSWE THREE COVERS UNTIL I FOUND ONE THAT FIT
5.0,"My last san disc micro card stopped working randomly, and got this one to replace it...it is perfect. Its way faster than the last one. Good price too."
5.0,get this for my hct phone it works great . not slow like some others i have had . but i didnt know about classes  for memery cards with the othere ones . good card . done not freeze or loose anything
1.0,"I've had these for less than a week and even though they are in great shape, the left speaker is now useless and not working. Its pretty upsetting considering i have a razer keyboard and bought this to replace my old razer headset which lasted me years. So ill be thinking about getting a different one and not this particular model."
4.0,I cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class 4 or 6. I use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly. Dont see a difference. But it has advertised capacity and works ok.
3.0,"Why is you buy a 16GB card and when you install it, you have only 14.8 GB? Exactly where does that 1GB+ I PAID FOR...go to?"
3.0,Pretty easy to apply and I appreciate the ability to adjust the placement.  The problem and praise is the thickness.  I find that it requires a harder touch and that can cause a problem when trying to type.  Overall I feel that it is good and durable but after having a tempered glass screen protector on another device I am very picky.
1.0,I don't notice any significant performance increase over the less expensive class 4 sandisk sd card.  I don't recommend this card.
4.0,Perfect for my SS Galaxy Note and a great price too!  I recommend this SD card for all your storage needs.
4.0,I like it. I had to trim a bit of leather in order to access a button
2.0,Cheap but works!
2.0,not good
1.0,Do not buy this mouse it has changed software and is no longer able to program buttons. GIVE IT A MISS THIS IS A GARBAGE!
2.0,The customer service is bad..it costs you to talk to someone for help even though the hardware warranty is still good.  Not a good product...my recommendation go with a another company that has a full warranty.  Very costly mistake.
4.0,Love it. Works perfectly fine
1.0,False advertisement. There are only 4 dpi settings: 1000-1600-2400-3200
2.0,"Okay, it took about a week from order to mailbox. I had no problem with it fitting my laptop. So, far it works as it should in that it charges to a full 100%. I'm going to check and see just how long the charge holds for and will update at the end of month #1. So, far no regrets.  It's been a few months - Okay, so I'm getting less than 2 hrs on a full charge. It's more like 1 hr 30...give or take a few mins extra.  You may get 2 hrs if you set the setting on your laptop just right, but I don't see anyone getting 3 hrs. UPDATE - It's been almost a year and I'm getting the dreaded, &#34;Low battery&#34; warning at startup telling to replace the battery. I feel like getting a year out of the  battery just isn't enough...dropping this down a star.   UPDATE 2 - 08/25/2016  I didn't think I'd get anywhere, but contacted seller and asked if the battery carried a warranty. I was told it did and was for one year. They sent me a new battery. I'll update once I've gotten some use out of it. So, for now the rating stays.  UPDATE 3 - 11/15/2016  A days ago, while starting my laptop, I got the dreaded &#34;Replace battery&#34; warning AGAIN. I've tried to calibrate the battery, but still the same issue. This battery lasted less than 3 months. The price of said battery seems to have gone a bit since I first bought it. While the battery seems fine with the A/C charger plugged in, still the point is be able to run the laptop with just battery power. I get 30 mins at best on &#34;Balance setting.&#34; I'd skip buying this battery for your laptop. The only good experience with this product is the co that sold me said battery did send me a replacement, but when the battery last such a short time, it's uneventful experience."
3.0,"First two order of this item were fails. They both failed around six months of use. However, Sandisk honored their warranty and completely replaced the items. Still using it, and pretty happy."
1.0,Waste of your money. It looks good but so thing it broke without me hitting it or anything. Will not be able to protect your computer at all.
2.0,"Tablet had issues from the second I powered it on. Only some of the letters on the keyboard work. So unless you don't need to use the H,N,U or C go ahead and buy it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,don't work very well with the screen protective sheeting
1.0,"This product has a fatal flaw.  It does not support the Windows offline files feature.  Using Windows 7, the Offline availability indicates &#34;Not available&#34;.  I have used a succession of NAS drives for many years (Buffalo and Seagate).  None of my past NAS drives was perfect but all of these drives have supported windows &#34;offline files&#34; feature out of the box.  I find &#34;offline files&#34; indispensable for a NAS drive.  Not only does it allow easy backups, which you can control, but it allows multiple users to work on the same project in the field without accidentally overwriting each others work.  The Windows Offline files feature also allows multiple laptops to be set up to back each other up for hardware failure.  When your laptop gives you the blue screen of death or you drop it while working on a ladder, no problem, just hit sync on your backup machine and at least you are back where you started the day (or better if you synced remotely).  You can have different laptops or tablets for different tasks and keep them all synced and ready to go.  In my opinion a NAS drive is not complete without the Windows Offline Files feature.  This limitation should have been clearly stated in the product advertising and literature."
2.0,"I was having some issues with my windows vista machine. I bought 2 of these to replace my current HDD only to find that when I booted my computer for the first time it bent me over and assaulted me sexually and without mercy...<br /><br />I'm writing this review from the police station in hopes to warn everyone,.. It's still out there, and it's hungry for more, If you see a compaq desktop in your neighborhood, don't bother calling OCZ support they are no help (if you can get an answer) Just get your biggest gun and show no mercy."
1.0,"Avoid this product at all costs. Even it were free, you'll end up losing money on wasted time, effort and frustration.  After numerous resets, and setup attempts with the woefully feature-poor configuration, no device could ever actually establish a connection with this repeater.  The best you'll see is &#34;limited access&#34; and &#34;cannot connect&#34;, even after the device says it has been setup successfully and is transmitting an SSID.  At the end of the day, this device's only function is to occupy a power outlet and cause its small LED lights to glow.  It certainly is not capable of actually functioning as a repeater."
3.0,"Worked very well with my ASUS transformer but it are still slight glitches in the touch.  So, just three stars"
1.0,"I just bought this item and I couldn't burn anything from beginning, they just give 1 month to claim a return but I was waiting to burn some projects I was working on. At the time I need it didn't recognize recordable disk as well movies."
1.0,Twice I have returned units after they quit working within a week or 10 days. Poor quality. Spend a bit more and get something that works.
2.0,charger gets very hot. have to put a fan on it even if used for short time.
1.0,"Charged my phone quickly for about a month. Then my phone kept telling me to use the original charger for faster charging and the cable  charging slowed down to a crawl. It also started to loosen up and my phone would go back and forth between charging and not charging due to how loose it was. However, they're cheap so I guess I'll buy another one and see how long it lasts.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bought a second. After about 2 months, this charger no longer works. Won't charge my phone at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: Bought a third. Worked again for about 2 months. Will be purchasing a 4th just because they're so cheap."
2.0,"Worked inconsistently for 5 months, then stopped charging completely."
1.0,I will never buy LaCie Again. Terrible drives that always crap out and refuse to mount after only a few months.
2.0,"The case has a fine plastic fabric-like rough surface which causes me pain to hold it in my hand.  It's difficult to describe - like chalk scratching on a chalkboard, but for touch rather than sound.  From reading other reviews, I appear to be alone in my assessment.  I had to return it."
5.0,Bought this item to use in my Android based tablet and it has worked just fine.  Doubled my storage capacity at a very reasonable cost.
3.0,"Works OK. The plug into the laptop is loose. It charges, but if you move the laptop, the plug wiggles and falls out. Made in China."
5.0,"Picked up several when they were discounted. work great in my Galaxy S4 phone, wifes Nikon V1 and my GoPro. No failures or inability to recognize card. Highly recommend ScanDisk products."
5.0,"Card runs great in my Note 2. Not sure how it compares to other ones in benchmark tests now, but there weren't that many options available to me at the time I bought it.Love having 64 Gig's of storage on my phone."
3.0,Not as good as the older generation. It could be that it ships with the soft tip instead of the firm that was shipped on the first generation.
3.0,It's okay for the price.
2.0,"I've had this mouse for a few weeks now. My experience has been awful. I may have received a defective mouse? My old and trusty mx-518 BLOWS this g502 out of the water for responsiveness and tracking. In game this g502 is garbage, feels awkward in the hand but it looks cool i guess.<br /><br />First thing I did was turn off the annoying lighting effects, for a night gamer it was very distracting.<br /><br />tl:dr Keep your MX this G502 is garbage."
5.0,Can't go wrong with this class 10 card cheap and works great may have to buy another one as a spare.
2.0,Not good quality.  Looks cheap
2.0,"I bought this tablet not expecting a lot for the price, and desiring to use it only to run a handful of low demand apps and play some downloaded videos. I understood the speaker wouldn't be great, and use an external speaker. I understood the screen would not be top grade. (It looks fine viewed straight on.)<br /><br />The killer for me is this issue of being unable to download apps because of insufficient space. (I think likely google is more to blame for this than anybody. My wife has a phone with the same issue.) Basically, because of the way the internal storage is partitioned, there is actually only about 1.9 GB of room for apps. The infuriating thing is that right out of the box, this space is almost entirely filled with all the google apps....and there is a ton of them! So when you go to download a new app, THERE IS NO ROOM! The google operating system won't let you move any of these google apps to the other partition. You can move other apps...IF you can download them in the first place without getting error messages. You can gain a little space by emptying the cache, but not enough to make room for a new app. Don't think that adding an SD card is a fix. There is no way to use this space for anything other than storing your own personal pictures and videos....it is no help with the app storage space issue.<br /><br />Astro Queo has provided a firmware update via email which is designed to make the internal storage one usable partition. Unfortunately the process is complex and can fail at any number of steps. Also, it requires loosing all your data and starting over. Furthermore, it only works using a Windows 8 computer. (Mine is a Windows 7)<br /><br />Since I don't use most of the preinstalled google apps, I was able to gain some space by disabling some of them, but you have to be careful as some google apps may be needed to operate some things you need. I gained enough room to install a couple of my desired personal apps, but am again very close to being right up against the issue of no room to download new apps and their needed updates from time to time.<br /><br />I give 2 stars because I think it is just unacceptable to sell a device that needs an immediate firmware update right out of the box, to even make it usable for the most basic things. (You have to be a techie to be able to do it, and need Windows 8.) I could live with the other expected limitations of an inexpensive tablet, but this storage issue is a killer. Unacceptable."
2.0,After a year it started coming a part. Otherwise it was good.
3.0,"I want to like this sso uch but the keyboard really does suck (like so many complain bout online) . Eveerything eelse is so perfect, it's a shame to be ruined by one failed feature. At the price I paid, it's worth it to me to keep it but wow it's annoying. I`vee left the mistakes so you can see the resultss. I`m also a very deliberate hunt-and-peck typit so the mistakes are not due to not pressing hard enough or inaccuracy. And yes the repeat rate is the slowest i gets. Thiss ssimply repeats letters and misses them at random.  The good news - I received the Microsoft Signature edition, brand new sealed. This was NOT a refurb. (from DeaalFisher) I would guess they are trying to clear these out due to known keyboard issues."
5.0,"I bought this sd card to expand the memory on my Samsung tablet.  I had read that the galaxy note could only be expanded up to 32gb as the sd card would have to be formated as fat32.Long story short,  I inserted it and without any problems or formatting it showed as 60 odd GB.Noyce!"
1.0,Worked a few times and then stopped.  Purchased a different brand.
5.0,"I purchased this for my husband, he's had this quite a while now and love it SanDisk is a reputable product."
5.0,Fast product when place in my camera. I am very happy with this product. The product was received pretty fast.  The material was as described and much better.  I do recommend this product to anyone.
5.0,excellent
3.0,"I own an ASUS ROG 17&#34; G73JHA1 gaming laptop I bought in 2010. It had came with an ASUS laptop book bag, but that got stolen. My laptop is PRETTY BIG, and I expected this to hold the laptop and conceal it perfectly. However, this laptop bag does not fully conceal my laptop, as the top protrudes from the zipper line, and I can not close the zipper. I can not even fit my charger and mouse WITH the laptop. Terrible buy. It is a paperweight essentially. My Herschel book bag can carry my laptop, charger and mouse, while this cant. STEER CLEAR"
2.0,"16.4&#34; in. x 11.7&#34; in. x 1.4&#34; in. is the specified size of this case. It is pretty but teribly flimsy in terms of protecting a laptop. No padding or stiffness. Because it will not hold even a thin 14 inch Thinkpad X1 Carbon laptop, I have to return it."
5.0,"With all the high definition video we take the extra memory is great. And with the micro cards, we save on space in the little camera bag we have."
4.0,"i love this micro sd.  It enables me to expand the storage space on my Acer W3.  Great price too,"

5.0,Best of the sub 20 dollar mini remotes I've tried.
2.0,"For folks who simply needs to convert their iPad to a desktop computer, this Anker Bluetooth folio keyboard will work fine so long you are not typing in a quiet space near someone taking a nap.  The good: sturdy construction, good layout and responsive keys, strong magnet that holds the iPad steady when typing, connects easily with the iPad, strong holders provided to retain the iPad, nice faux leather and grey felt on the inside and cover shuts off the iPad screen when closed.  The keyboard is responsive and keys have good tension feedback by supportive springs.  For the short duration I tried the keyboard folio, I had no battery problem. The unit worked right out of the box and charged without issue.  The bad: works in only one position--desktop landscape with no angle adjustments and no portrait position use. In folio closed position there is no magnet holder or snaps or anything else that will hold the folio closed, which could be resolved by adding strong magnets outside of the iPad holder brackets. Like the IOS software keyboard no escape key is provided-function key and home key combo may be an option (I forgot to try it).  Cover captures fingerprints easily, but cleans easily. The keyboard keys cannot operate quietly.<br /><br />Had it not been for the one position operation mode provided, I would have overlook all other points listed as bad. The iPad is too versatile to have the keyboard operate in on position only. When operating the iPad and keyboard on my knees, another screen angle is required."
5.0,This item was perfect!
1.0,Very disappointed. Was my 5th fire...TOO SMALL...COULD NOT INCREASE FONT SIZE ANY BIGGER THAN 3. RETURNED TO Office Depot for refund
2.0,This is a far inferior product to my previous Kindle. There is no button on the device to press to take me back to the home screen. There is no connection for a case that comes with a built in light (and of COURSE there is no option for backlight). I am extremely disappointed with Amazon's design for the &#34;new&#34; generation Kindle. Don't buy it. Unless you honestly can afford only the cheap option. Because that's what this is. It's a cheap piece of ****.
2.0,"Covers up the charging port, and the stand mechanism is so stiff it keeps falling down"
1.0,"This caddy is not compatible with my Asus N56VJ, so I'm a little upset and very disappointed."
1.0,"This package contains two microphones.  The larger, which I was hoping to use, did not work.  It was dead out of the package.  The smaller one works fine.  Fortunately Amazon returns are very easy."
3.0,There is something wrong with the power key and the left ctrl key. The power button is stuck after being pressed and so does the left ctrl button. How to solve this problem????
2.0,Does not work with older version of Bluetooth. My advice is to check carefully for Bluetooth compatibility before buying. Even newer machines may not be compatible.
1.0,"The drive works just fine in another machine, but when I used this the external enclosure would not power on four months after I bought it. The power supply still shows 10 DCV but the board in the drive enclosure is dead."
4.0,It works just fine.
5.0,Great product.  Good quality. Very pleased with this purchase.  Love the dividers & pockets & the interior material.
4.0,Had the original kindle which tragically was dropped and screen cracked....Love the new kindle.
4.0,Works great with Plex. Using Ready Cloud app to access your movies in your readynas needs updating. Please have desktop readycloud app for Mac osx available.
5.0,"This sd card is everything that is stated.Blazing fast and huge storage.It had so much space, when I first staryed taking pictures and videos, the phone didn't even show what the limit was. It basically had no limit on how many pictures or video space was the max."
2.0,"It charged just as fast as the basic cable that came with my Galaxy s5 charger, but this one died after like 6 months. All I ever used it for was charging at night or charging while I was sitting on the sofa, so it's not like it experienced a lot of wear and tear. I was hoping a cable this thick and sturdy would have a longer lifespan, so I'm pretty disappointed."
1.0,Piece of crap died two months after I bought itI am sure that makes it on me to buy anotherGREAT!
2.0,Came DOA. Not worth sending back since so cheap. Will not order again.
1.0,This is a knock off from China and will not work on iPhones (Zero stars)
2.0,Picture IS MISLEADING! This is not a grounded 3 prong plug. It is A 2 prong. Would not have purchased had picture shown this.
5.0,"I'm currently using this product in my Canon Digital Camera, I took over 120 pictures & 20 videos while on vacation in Escondido, Mexico  with more than 85% room still left on the card! Also with me using a micro SD Card, if I wish to send the picture right away I can easily just snap the card into my cell phone to post the pictures to Facebook or email for example?"
2.0,"It is likely that I don't quite know how to use some of the features and functions of the WinBook TW802.  But I am not satisfied, and would not recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />1.  The touch pad surface is very insensitive.  With Win 8.1, i could rarely get the normal touch screen functions to work.  So I bought a separate stylus, the best I could find, but the touchpad still remains very insensitive.  So, I bought a BlueTooth mouse.<br />2.  When the Bluetooth connectivity works, the mouse makes a huge difference.  The accurate point and click of the mouse removed the problems I had with the touchpad.  However, Bluetooth connections are very unstable.  I have to go through a repeated process of forgetting and reconnecting both the mouse and the provided keyboard.  Thinking this problem might be the keyboard and mouse, I paired both with my Samsung Android pad, and both work flawlessly.  I have to conclude that it is the WinBook TW802 which has a weak or unstable Bluetooth operation.  So, the Bluetooth will be dedicated to my Samsung pad.<br />3.  To ovecome this problem wih Bluetooth, I hoped to get better touch pad function with Windows 10, and so upgraded.  Win 10 seems to run quite well, actually seems somewhat faster than Win 8.1.  However, the touch pad surface of the TW802 is still insensitive, and I really still have to use a mouse.<br />4.  To overcome the Bluetooth problems, I purchased a Logitech keyboard and mouse combination, and connected that to the standard USB port.  This actually worked well, except I had to carry a rather large keyboard with a tiny computer, which rather defeats the point of a small Windows tablet.<br />5.  Following the installation of Win 10, I see that now the available SSD storage is almost entirely flled up with the OS.  So now I get the space warnings for my C; drive.  And of course, Win 10 won't yet allow me to move applications to the 32 MB SD storage.<br />So, I am kind of stuck.  I guess I wil just set this aside as a bad decision.  That being said, I got a great deal on a very compact  Lonovo notebook, so I might never need to go back to the TW802, and I can just send this to a museum.<br />RE Jacobs"
1.0,"I bought this.  I needed a question answered.  So I wrote Samsung Support.  It took me half an hour to even find their form on their website, and it doesn't list this model as a dropdown.<br /><br />They said they can't even answer a simple spec unless I'm fully registered.<br /><br />I'm not going to register because I hate Samsung spam.  I have a 4-year old Sony Vaio.  Everything on my Vaio runs twice as fast as Book9.  This is so slow it's a dog.  I wish I could return it and get my money back."
1.0,Ugly copper penny color
2.0,"There is extremely little flexibility on facing your tablet with this device. Extremely disappointed. If your mic stand is just so, and the angle is just so, you're OK, but if you need to turn it at all, forget it. Piece of crap for my use (on a keyboard rig)."
2.0,"Do not purchase ANY products from this company, especially Chromebooks.  They are poorly made and poorly serviced.  HP’s customer service knows nothing of either the customer or service.<br /><br />I have been awaiting shipment of my replacement Chromebook for over a month (details below).  Due to the complexity of my issue I was assigned a Customer Relations Case Manager (Vivian Hernandez, PPS CSS-A Customer Relations Case Manager).  Her co-worker, Paola Vanessa Picon was also included in all correspondence.<br /><br />The last I heard from either of these two ladies was on Aug 11th.  I was told that my Chromebook would ship on Aug 28th.  That day has come and gone.  Despite several follow up emails and voice messages I have not heard back.  Attempts to call several HP service numbers proved fruitless as the reps either could not access my case information or had non-functioning voice mail systems.<br /><br />So here’s my story...<br /><br />In November of 2014 I purchased an HP Chromebook 14. It had 4G of RAM and a 32G SDD. I was happy with it. While not as sleek as an Apple product, it met my needs.<br /><br />Around Feb or March of this year (2015) I noticed that some of the keys weren't working, specifically the I, J, U, T, and a few others. I installed all updates, and even power washed the unit, but no luck. I called HP, they agreed that the unit was defective and dispatched a box for return and repair.<br /><br />After about 2 weeks I received the unit back, but the keys STILL didn't work. Checking the paperwork it became clear that HP replaced the MOTHER board, not the KEY board.<br /><br />I called, complained and another box was dispatched. This repair took over three weeks due to some part shortage. I found this unacceptable, complained and my repair was expedited.<br /><br />I received my repaired unit in April, but noticed that Chrome would crash (He's Dead Jim) frequently. I put up with it for a while, but recently started to dig around. What I discovered is that I no longer have 4Gig of RAM, but 2 Gig and that my processes consume most of that.  When the motherboard was replaced it had the incorrect RAM size.<br /><br />After contacting HP yet again, and speaking to the above case manager, it was agreed that a new Chromebook was in order.  This was on July 28th.  Any and all attempts to determine when (or if) my new Chromebook will ship have been met with radio silence.  Emails are not answered and phone messages are not returned.  Collectively I’ve spent hours either on hold or  speaking to a rep.<br /><br />I’ve come to the conclusion that the replacement of my Chromebook was a lie, that HP felt that if they delayed the process long enough, I’d simply give up and go away.<br /><br />Purchase a product from this company if you feel you have no alternative, but do so knowing that in the event service is required (even under warranty) you're basically on your own.<br /><br />You've been warned."
4.0,"Keeps everything where it needs to be, good buy"
2.0,The UNO works fine. The LCD module does not light up.
1.0,it shows up  mycomputer can't do anything with it???
5.0,I bought this card specifically to run CyanogenMod 10 to my old nook Nook Color to breathe some life back into the device that I never use anymore. This card works great to run CM10 with the Nook thanks to its speed. A quick overclock of the processor via CM10 and the tablet is dare I say &#34;peppy&#34;. I highly recommend this card for any application where speed is crucial.
5.0,"This tablet is near perfect! I was going to give it four stars, but that would just be insulting. There is only one downfall to this tablet, but once you know the way to deal with it, then you're left with a great great tablet!<br /><br />I'll address the issue right away to get it out of the way. This tablet has problems with updating and resetting. Whenever you go to perform one of these system tasks the tablet will begin the process normally, but then it will end up with a black screen. Now when people see black screens they tend to panic, I personally tried to turn on the tablet because I had thought it was finished, but it wasn't! This causes many issues and can brick your tablet, I luckily got mine to turn on again. The trick is that you have to leave your tablet on and plugged in, and even when you see the black screen don't do anything because it will eventually turn on with all the the updates installed. So to summarize if you go to update or refresh, sit by your tablet, have it plugged in and just wait for the black screen to pass because that is when the tablet is working. At the end you will see the tablet turn on to your lock-screen.<br /><br />Once you figure update anything that you have to then you can finally enjoy the amazing tablet. I want to start out by saying that for a hundred bucks you get so much more than I would have expected. I will start off with the build. The back of the tablet has very small ridges, but this allows for some added grip. Around the body of the tablet you will find a micro usb port, a headphone jack and your micro sd card slot. The micro sd card is very welcomed as there is only around 2.5gb of usable space when you get the tablet. On top of the great ports and feel it has a very sturdy construction so feel free to toss it in your bag and bring it around with you.<br /><br />Now on to the use of the tablet. When you're navigating the tablet it is extremely speedy! This tablet has never stuttered on me or slowed down. Now you obviously can't do anything to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed! It can even do some light gaming, like Asphalt and other similar games from the Windows Store. The display on it makes the overall experience even better! It has great colors and no back-light bleed. Even though it is lower resolution the tablet still has a pretty sharp screen, whether you're watching movies, playing games, or surfing the web it provides a great viewing experience.<br /><br />Overall this is a great tablet for both pleasure and productivity. I highly recommend it as it is very fast and overall a pleasure to use.<br /><br />~I was provided a free sample in exchange for an unbiased review~ng to intensive on it like video editing, but basic tasks it handles with ease and speed!

4.0,"works well with my hero3 black gopro.its not on the approved micro SD HC card list from gopro, but it should. works great and low cost - cant beat it."
5.0,"Fit was perfect, worked like a dream, price was right, shipping was faster then stated.  Great job."
2.0,Speedy delivery and item comes as described. It also works. Give one confidence in doing business with this seller.
5.0,I got these on sale and must say they truly have so much space for a good price. SO anytime you see them on sale start snatchng these babies up especially if you like to travel.
4.0,"The decal sticker that your going to get is ok, when this is all you can afford. The nice thing is if you don't line it up right you can re-apply it over and over and it will still stick."
3.0,"It's just okay. If you touch the screen while it's in the upright position it falls down. And of course, the white gets dirty fairly quickly."
3.0,Good unit but does not work with newer versions of MAC operating systems. I had to buy a separate router to use it which has to be pregrammed with each wifi that I connect with.
3.0,I cannot believe I paid $25.49 for what is clearly a $5.00 product.  It cam without batteries that were to have been included so I don't even know that it is really worth even $5.00. This order was a learning experience for me.  I ordered the reading light on August 5 and it arrived on August 31.  Why?  Because it shipped from China.  Shame on me.  I will now pay much closer attention to where my money is going.
5.0,It is a good card and does the job well.  Now I am going to have to fill in this space as there isn't much else to say about this.  Using this as expansion for Dell Venue 8 Pro.  Now have almost 64G of open capacity on the tablet.
5.0,Honestly I just don't care anymore. If this thing works as intended then I suppose its fast to me. Get it.
4.0,Good
4.0,"I suffer from carpal tunnel and this mouse has been a life saver. I tried the Apple trackpad, and I tried the Anker vertical mouse--both were better than a traditional mouse for me, but neither quite gave me the relief that this one does. My only complaint is it is a bit cheaply made - it tipped over and fell a couple of feet, and the bottom completely separated from the top. I couldn't get it to seal tightly again. Sent it back for a replacement which I got, and am waiting for confirmation that the trade in was accepted. Even if it's cheaply made, it's the best thing I have found for my hand, so I would replace it again if needed."
3.0,"There always have some drive problem which make me have to re-install the drive again and again, but at least, it works, indeed."
1.0,Does not write discs
5.0,All Amazon products continue to meet my expectations
3.0,the micro sd works great as described. but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty. the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter. you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter.
1.0,"The black ear coverings are not securely attached to the headphones, and came off as we opened the packaging. I spend over an hour trying to fold ends under and re-attach but was unable to do so."
4.0,Gave as a gift. Don't know if its good or not. Sorry. I received it. Since I haven't hear from my daughter I'm assuming it works.
4.0,"I use this solely as a stand for my old ipad1 in my kitchen for recipes. I think it would be too heave to put under the counter without some serious reinforcement. As a stand, it is great."
4.0,"I would give these a 5th star if the memory  had consistent read/write times per card.I'm not saying they aren't fast,  but they all should stay within the rated speed they've been tested for, especially when in a USB 3.0 card  reader! After they have been used several times their speed decreases to below the threshold,  of the Standard set for these chips."
5.0,"I have been using this card for about a month now, in my Contour ROAM 2 camera, and it has performed flawlessly. I have not had any issues, and have deleted and re-used several times. So far, so good!"
2.0,Too fragile.
1.0,"There's a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there's a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device's internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they're what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn't going to stand by a counterfeit."
2.0,It's ok....
3.0,"It works fine, but just a little disappointed that it doesn't stay in the open position without slipping into flat mode."
1.0,Broke after 1 month
5.0,I bought 2 of these.  They arrive before the due date and were in perfect shape. I installed one in an old smart phone and it is working again.  Good service.
4.0,Old tech but needed for and old system.
3.0,Works OK
3.0,Noisy...but ok
3.0,"Unfortunately this product wouldn't work with my computer, each time I plugged it in my computer screen would turn black. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the USB ports on my computer or what, but it was quite disappointing. The box and instructions are all in another language, of course it is self-explanatory how to use the thing but I still want to be sure I'm using it correctly. I am starting the return process. It honestly is not bad for the price though."
4.0,"Works great, but i can tell it was made for people with especially large heads. Whenever i lean my head back in frustration when i die in CS:GO, it almost falls right off, which is a bit of a problem. Also, the Dolby surround sound switch out right SUCKS, all it does is make it sound like you're in an echoey room with everything and does not work as advertized."
3.0,"The case does its job of protecting against scrapes/scratches/etc.  However, after using it for about a month and a half the rubberized feet have come off and I've had to hot glue them back on.  Three out of the four have come off in the past week, so I'm anticipating the 4th one to come off soon enough.  Without the rubber feet the case is pointless, because I have a granite countertop and the computer will slide off without them.  Also, If you wear lotion this is not the case for you.  It shows EVERY bit of oil or lotion on the case that rubs off from your skin."
4.0,Love the small size as they don't take up much room on the desk. We're using them on a PC. The sound is good but there's a constant hum so we unplug when not in use.
1.0,threw it away
3.0,"Nice cover except I could only use the top which is wee bit loose, the bottom part didn't fit even though it listed it was for Macbook Air."

1.0,"I don't like it, cant download any games, cant get on internet at my home, in which I have wireless internet sevice!!! very disappointed!!!!!!!"
4.0,Very good drive for the price. No complaints. Plays all my DVDs and CDS.
3.0,This is now the fourth tablet from this same company. They always seem to malfunction in one way or another. The latest one the charging port will no longer work. This time it only took about a month or less for it to break
4.0,So far so good. I've always liked WD drives.
4.0,"Do not buy this if speed is an issue. You want type 4 at least for speed, but this type 1 works great in my phone to just increase storage. I keep all my pictures on it and random files. I have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music."
1.0,The operating system did not work when it arrived. I had to pay additional money to have it fixed.  Shortly after it stopped working.  What a waste of money.  Do not purchase.
3.0,"Decent while it lasted, then about 4-6months of ownership, the left button just stopped being springy, would engage click randomly. Mouse is useless now."
2.0,Modem died in less than 45 days. I hate Century Link. Options are limited though here in Southern Arizona.
2.0,"Its already failing I received this pump Aug 6, 2015 and its August 26 2015 as of this post. Its already started grinding and chugging and water level is all the way to the top of the gauge.  Going to contact for replace/refund. But it means my PC will be down until I get a replacement part."
3.0,"I purchased 15 of these to make an extra battery pack for my electric bike and tore all of them apart. The individual battery cells inside the pack are rated at 1800 mAh which are on the lower end of 18650 cells. Although the cells are generic no brand Chinese cells in green color, they are not fake since I did a capacity test using my Imax B6 smart charger and their real capacity was around 1700-1800 mAh. Therefore the real capacity of the whole battery is 3600 mAh or 40 Wh so the 5200 mAh rating on the package is not true.<br />The overall quality of the battery pack is OK, however there is a very critical issue with the battery management circuit board inside the pack: THERE IS NO TEMPERATURE SENSOR! I don't care about this, because I just needed the cells out of the pack and threw the rest away, however for someone who is going to use this in their laptop, it is not safe! the battery might overheat while charging and melt or catch fire since there is no temp sensor. Be aware of this and do not buy these if you need a safe battery for your laptop."
2.0,Didn't like the picture quality of the cams..very basic cam..returned it within few days
1.0,"Didn't last 2 months. Bought this & 3 Irulu 7 tablets at the same time and this one being used less stopped working, won't take a charge, not worth the extra money."
5.0,"Lightning fast -- I bought this when I moved into my apartment in Cambridge, MA, since I didn't want to pay a recurring fee to Comcast to rent inferior equipment (and I especially didn't want my bandwidth to be shared as an XFINITY hotspot). I chose it over the battle-tested Arris models because it was a good price for a future-proof modem. Who knows, someday maybe Comcast will have gigabit over DOCSIS.<br /><br />One of the neat secrets is that XFINITY actually provisions a slightly higher speed than the advertised tier, in part to allow bursting to a higher speed at the start of a download. This modem allowed me to take advantage of that. Even though the rep told me my Blast package is &#34;up to 105 Mbps&#34; down, it's actually at &#34;up to 150 Mbps&#34; in this area, and my speed test when connected directly by Gigabit Ethernet to this cable modem reached 178 Mbps. I'm about to get a [[ASIN:B00BUSDVBQ TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 Dual Band Wireless AC Gigabit Router]], so we'll see how it goes!"
5.0,Works perfectly in my 738 Samsung. Phone is only USB 2 so I don't know if you really need such a fast mem chip. Can get a lot of stuff into 32 gb. I use for Movies for when I am on the train and don't want to waste my data streaming from the cloud.
2.0,"I bought several of these in Oct,2013 and last March one began to fail. I quickly ordered a new one and not five months later it has begun to fail. Last time it wouldn't hold a higher RPM and quite rotating soon after that. I'm ordering another option quickly anticipating the same time line."
3.0,ok
2.0,"There was a broken bumper button, after waiting for delivery it was not worth my time to try to get a replacement"
1.0,Fell apart after about 1 month :(
2.0,"Only works to import CDs to iTunes - and only certain CDs at that. The eject doesn't always work. Many times I have had to unplug the USB, and plug it back in so that the drive can restart. Then, after it configures, it will open. If you're looking for something temporary (until you get a new computer) this is okay. For long term use, I would not recommend this."
3.0,"The surface is a little large for me, but that may be good for others. I would have also preferred a fuller base for balance, but I'm comparing it to one that was used for years. The survace of this is durable and can be wiped with a damp cloth. The light stores in a zippered area at the top of the padded bottom, so it does not always have to be out, but that also means it is felt on the lap while using the desk. I have no need for the drink holder, so it is not used."
1.0,I purchased this adapter hoping it will fit into the unit as indicated with the various model use. This was the second purchase and I don't have the opportunity again to return the merchandise. this have been a frustrating process. Did not work as the tip of the adapter was to fine and very loose for the Lenovo g575.
1.0,"Cord started ripping apart at the connection within a few months, can't use it anymore"
5.0,Now I have a lot more room on my phone. It can be overkill for some but extra space is only wasted if you never use it.

4.0,"works exactly as promised. No way to recall a drawing though, which is irritating (you get them synched to your phone and from there to other apps, but can't review or edit your work on the device. :("
1.0,Both the outer cover and the keyboard cover broke within a month! I am very disappointed with this product. It gets one star because it arrived rather quickly.
3.0,"Seems to be okay.  The instructions are not correct to connect the mouse, but just refer to the reviews to see the correct procedure."
1.0,"rec and was happy.  good price, but we get want we pay for. the scan dic. would no por matt"
5.0,"I currently have all my downloaded music on this car sitting in my surface RT.  I haven't done any measurements on how fast the transfer rate of this card is, but I can tell you that it is fully capable of playing music and videos from the card to my Surface RT with no lag at all.  It was also a very good value as far as price/size/speed ratio."
2.0,"Absolutely wonderful case. It's very slim and fits my Macbook Air 11 inch perfectly. I've used it for about 2 months now and it has held up extremely well! I'm extremely pleased and would definitely recommend it!!<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />After using this case for about 4 months now, the little plastic grips on the bottom of the case that prevent your laptop from sliding around when it is set on a table have completely fallen off. This case is pretty much worthless, now. I'll have to spend more money to buy a new one. If I could, I would contact the company, but I have no idea how- thanks a lot, Amazon! I really wouldn't even recommend this case anymore. After less than 6 months, it's broken and ruined."
4.0,No issues.
5.0,No issues at all. I ended up utttingthis in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of my Tab2 like I had originally planned. I will be ordering another one soon.
2.0,"I'm pretty pissed off right now. I paid $50 for this case 3 months ago for my brand new 13&#34; MacBook Pro. When I carry it outside the home, I always put it in a padded sleeve (hence, the case is mostlu for aesthetics and protection from minor drops and scratches. About 2 weeks after I got it, some cracks appeared in one of the corners. Then today, the plastic in the opposite corner completely broke off, leaving that corner of the computer unprotected. There is a 1-year warranty on the case, so I will be contacting Speck to hopefully get a new case or a refund. The worse part is that Amazon doesn't seem to carry the Poppy Red color anymore, so if Speck can't get me an exact replacement, I'll probably have to go with a different color… Or maybe a different brand.<br /><br />I will also add that I've used Speck cases on 4 different MacBook Pros since 2009 and I've never had a case break this fast."
2.0,"Not a good brand, have had too many issues with proscan. From freezing constantly, to the charging port stop charging. Cracked screen after first drop! the lists go on. You get what you pay for!"
3.0,"The sound quality and packaging on these headphones are exquisite. There isn't much to say that hasn't been stated in prior reviews, and they feel quite sturdy. The metal frame holding one of the ear cups is bent however and now they do not sit  on my ears properly and sound escaped plus they feel uncomfortable due to the awkward angle the ear cup bows out at. If it isn't wasn't for this defect these would be my favorite headphone."
3.0,"Everything works perfectly except the bottom front portion does not stay clipped to the bottom of the plastic frame.  The soft rubber part is designed to hook to a plastic frame, but the rubber part doesn't hook.  It just sort of hangs there.  Only on the bottom, all of the other 3 sides clip in the frame and work and look quite good.  I works well enough that it gives the iPad protection against drop, etc.  Not a problem big enough to warrant a return."
3.0,Low performance wifi
1.0,I've had this computer for 1.5 months and it already broke.......
3.0,"I really liked this, but I do have a few complaints. It has very good picture quality especially for how cheap it was, and I loved that it had the manual focusing. The things that I didn't like were that it was very light so I had to tape it down so it would not move. Also for some reason it took forever to like my computer. I have a fairly new windows laptop and it took a couple of times of me plugging it in and pulling it out and plugging it back in. Overall it was just okay."
4.0,"At first I had some issues, did a hard reset and the modem is working fine now"
2.0,"This protector creates a noticeable drop in sensitivity for the Acer ICONIA screen, to the point that children's fingers won't be able to register a &#34;drag&#34; across the screen.  I ended up removing the screen and taking my chances with the unprotected gorilla glass.<br /><br />Install was easy enough. You're going to have bubbles under the protector, and the included &#34;squeegee&#34; is worthless.  I ended up using a more rigid squeegee from another screen protector to complete the install.<br /><br />Item does not come in a rigid package, either.  It would be very easy for this to arrive bent, causing a permanent crease in part of your protector."
2.0,Has a bad habit of not wanting to pair after it goes to sleep have to shutoff and restart.
2.0,These things are slow as hell.  I only bought them because size was more of a concern than performance and they're really quite tiny.
5.0,Good
5.0,"I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me..."
5.0,"These are really small and work great for me. I use them on two computers, an old windows machine and my work computer with is a Mac Pro that I also game on. I find the speed and reliability to be above reproach.<br /><br />It was easier to set up on the Mac running OS 10.7.5 than it was on the Windows machine running Vista. I don't know about later versions."
5.0,It works so good. easy to set it up!
3.0,Does not work as a network drive as my previous LaCie Little Big Disk did.
2.0,I don't usually write reviews to put it simply i got the wrong screen on the product description<br />Screen Size: 15.6&#34;<br />Connector: 30 Pins<br />Screen Finish: Glossy<br />Maximum Resolution: 1366*768<br />1 Year Warranty<br /><br />but i got a 40 Pins connector i am very disappointed
1.0,"The hard drive completely fried in one day (no exaggeration).  All data were lost.  The drive would not even mount.  It made awful noises when I tried.  Looking through the reviews afterwards, it seems I'm not the only one with this experience.  I've had dozens of hard drives over the past 25 years and I usually chase a good price not worrying much about performance.  Thinking back, I realize I've had a lot of Seagate drives fail one way or another.  Although, they have never failed this quickly and catastrophically."
1.0,Smells like burning. Buzzes loudly. Does not work. Please send me a replacement.
4.0,Does the job for me.
1.0,didn't work
5.0,"Very good for information or Photo storage in a small device, I have 2 so far for different computers and is great."
2.0,"Not impressed with these laptops at all which is sad since I've always had a high regard for Dell computers. Attempting to image these computers has been an exercise in futility, nothing has worked including Ghost, Fog, or Acronis. There is also a very loud and annoying &#34;pop&#34; from the speakers that is heard often when clicking the mouse on items."
3.0,OK
3.0,The cords aren't very long. But they work.
1.0,Lasted maybe a month before it started to expand and push on my trackpad. Not impressed.
1.0,"This ""Ultra High Speed"" card is about half the speed of the Class 4 card I was using.  10MB/s Read and 6MB/s write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform.  I could believe if it was the same speed as my old card, maybe my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 doesn't have a UHS1 rated port, but to be half the speed of my Class 4 card, this ""UHS1"" thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control. I wish I knew how to rate with 0 stars."
2.0,Recorded speech had a very metallic sound.
4.0,"Not crazy about Windows 10, but I like the computer. Dell is the best! I have had an HP and a Toshiba, both were horrible. I just need to get used to the Windows 10."
4.0,"Works fine, but it is becoming very annoying that even with flash devices you buy 16GB but only get 15GB. Why not just label it as the exact size?"
5.0,"A very reliable monitor, without all the latest perks. I have three of them on my desk."
1.0,"Horrible piece of junk!! Only used once and it failed disastrously! Just quit working, no indicator light, nothing. Same thing happened with a PNY 128GB &#34;Turbo&#34;. These were for my desktop computer; never carried anywhere, never exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. I own, or have owned dozens of flash drives, by many of the leading makers and these PNY's are the only ones to have just plain failed. Stay away from PNY!"
2.0,"one stick worked, the other didn't. will have to figure out the returns ordeal now."
3.0,I can tell they're refurbished.
3.0,"Like other reviewers, I noticed this drive failing to write properly not long after getting it out of the box.  I bought it b/c i needed to burn 50+ disks (CD) on short notice and also had to provide a SLIM drive to someone whose primary unit lacked an internal optical drive. The product gets good reviews in a lot of places on the web, so I downplayed some of the few complaints I had read.<br /><br />It burned nonstop almost continuously as I worked through my project, which may have contributed to the failures prompting my less-than-stellar rating. Then, I encountered the first &#34;unable to write&#34; (an approx of the message... when retrying, my burn software simply advised inserting a disk, as if it did not see the one inside).  i assumed i had a bad disk, or had used one inadvertently that I had already written to... then the message repeated 3 disks in a row, and i got extremely frustrated.  i returned a lot later to same errors (on another and on the same disks).<br /><br />I returned the next day, and all was peachy keen, until it happened again after a dozen more disks.<br /><br />I finished my project on another more cumbersome setup with another drive, and moved on.<br /><br />The disk has never faulted on READING, although i have probably tried only a dozen or so disks, in contrast to my writing experience.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Not for a similarly large project, no.  For casual use, yes."
2.0,Works
4.0,good product
1.0,I'm really pissed off because I wasted money on this AND IT DOESNT EVEN SAY I PURCHASED IT! Don't waste your time people.
1.0,"not the sellers fault, but the only thing magnetic about this cover is that when you use it in the lower stand mode there is a magnet in the back of the cover that holds the cover in place, of course this is when you least need it.  When using the Higher stand mode, there is nothing to keep anything in place.  Poor design my Samsung.  I returned it and replaced it with the MoKo cover.  Much more functional"
5.0,works great! what else can i say?
4.0,Works perfectly and has enough storage for many hours of recording.Could be the best one out there for the price.Recommend this one.
1.0,The one I received was defective.
4.0,"Good product. Easy installation. Excellent technical support provided 24/7, by qualified technicians.  This is a good router."
4.0,the fans are not quite as strong as i would have liked but it seems to be working fine so i have no complaint.
1.0,These lasted about a week each
4.0,"I have an older Kindle fire & recieved the Paperwhite as a gift. The paper white is a perfect size and handy for reading books you already purchased. Shopping for titles is a little more difficult because the covers dont render very well in black and white.<br />Pages are easy to read,  the blacklight adjustment is easy to use for any lighting situation.<br />If the Paperwhite is going to be your only e-reader keep in mind that shopping is easier thru a tablet, laptop or desktop."
2.0,This mouse pad is definitely comfortable and it's features are as expected. Except for the fact that it doesn't work with my mouse. I don't know why.
3.0,"I bought two of these 128 gb MicroSD cards which I formatted to Fat32, and I currently have about 62 gb in 35,000 files on each card.  I carry one card in my wallet and keep one in a safe deposit off-site.  I've been through the SanDisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use, other than as ordinary &#34;flash memory&#34; for file storage.  There are no restrictions I could find.  What I have found is that these 128 gb cards (and a SanDisk 64 gb card I bought previously) cannot accept 62 gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors.  I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.  The errors actually occur early on, at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point.  I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.  To repeat, there are no restrictions on the use of these memory cards (example: can be used only in a camera) given by SanDisk, and given that the 62 gb of data on each card has been verified as to integrity, they are not defective."
2.0,Did not perform as expected.
2.0,"This case will NOT fit a 15.4&#34; laptop because it does NOT fit my 15&#34; laptop!  It has a built in tray which takes up too much of the room, preventing this case from stretching to fit (contrary to the description).  My other BUILT laptop case does fit snugly but it stretches plus it has pockets for the cords, mouse, etc.<br /><br />Normally, I LOVE BUILT stuff--I have a lunch bag in this pattern as well as a computer accessories pouch that are great--but this is a BIG disappointment!"
5.0,this was on sale for a much lower price than normal retail. i even bought 2. one was the drop tech. one was the glass tech. install is easy enough. the drop tech has a plastic screen saver pre-attached.  only minor issue is sometimes having to press hard near the corners of the touch screen because the plastic screen protector leaves a small gap between it and the screen in the corners. the glass tech model has a pane of real glass that lays tight against the screen and is usually $10 more and probably worth it. the army green color is perfect and the texture and raised pattern of the rubber gives you a much better grip than the naked aluminum of the surface. i was going to buy the urban gear brand but for the price i got these at it can't be beat.
3.0,I got this to replace my regular system and frankly was disappointed.  I tried adjusting the picture but it just isn't as sharp.  The unit is just &#34;less&#34; all around.  For the inch or two of space you save it's not worth it.
4.0,Work very well
1.0,"Misleading thumbnail! i have not bought this product, if you are just looking to buy this product at a glance because the top portion says its a mechanical keyboard this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, it has membrane switches. with the supposed &quot;feel&quot; of mechanical switches."
1.0,"my keyboard have a whole line of letters that do not work i just bought it A;Q;Z;1, please help!!!"
5.0,"It is very fast , I like it And I think if you have one you will like it I think."
5.0,"This thing works great. I have it to store pictures and videos and it works perfectly. I put it in and it formatted, and after that, no hassle at all. It was the best priced microsd here on Amazon and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy again if I needed to."
4.0,Excellent read speeds -- 90.11MB/s Seq but not so good write speeds 17.38 MB/s - benched with Crystaldiskmark in a USB3.0 adapter which does a fair assessment of SD and microsd card speeds...<br /><br />What this means is I would not slap this in a Hero 4 and roll the dice as the write speeds are too slow for that.  Still not bad for my Galaxy S5 or Note 4.  Will need to pick up faster 64GB cards for the Hero 4 cam though.<br /><br />Would have been more impressed with 80MB/s read and 30MB/s write but still an OK card.
5.0,It is reasonably priced and so far it is great.
1.0,"I really want to like these and I do trust SanDisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards. That said, I'm moving on to my 3rd card. Thank you Amazon for having exceptional customer service, or else I'd be very upset.Basically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore. You can't save files to it, you can't delete files from it and you can't event format it. I've tried doing all three in different OS'es and devices with no luck. Doing some reading on the SanDisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cards.I'm returning this to Amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens."
5.0,"got this for my picture loving grandmother, she loves it as much as I do mine..."
5.0,Purchased this to expand the memory of my unit and it is operating just the way I needed it to work.
3.0,"It's very heavy. I could tell more when I compared it to my roommate's case. Without the case, the weight of the tablet is halved and becomes much easier to carry. The case itself protects the tablet well though. It says the shipping weight is 4.8 ounces, I wonder if it is very much different from their other product that seems to be 4 ounces? Since the case just comes with a foam filler on the inside for protection, I don't know if the foam accounts for that extra .8 ounces in shipping or not. I'm wondering if I should try a different company or buy what seems to be the different version of the case made by the same company."
4.0,Good fur the price but I a.m. returning mine cuz won't hold Charge
4.0,Exactly what it says it is. Handy for my phone. Price was good
1.0,"I am really upset with this &#34;shatterproof&#34; screen protector. My 14 month old had my phone for 1-2 minutes, bit my phone, broke the glass, and swallowed shards of glass. This is the worst screen protector I have ever purchased and would not recommend it to anyone, and if I could give it zero I would."
4.0,Seems to function great. The only thing we have is that occasionally it needs to be power cycled.
2.0,Broke in less than a month
1.0,Totally wasted $60 on this battery.  Didn't work on my 17&#34; MBP (Mid-2009).  Went to Apple and had them replace it with their battery for an arm and a leg - but at least it worked.
5.0,for my note pro.  note pro says 29.71 GB available...the mysterious 2.29 GB black hole strikes again.
1.0,"Received two today and they have ""Made in China"" imprinted on them.  Although they were detected and formatted fine to capacity in both Samsung phone and tablet, lets see if they hold up and not suffer premature death like many have reported.  Thinking I should've gone with ""Made in Korea"" Samsung SD cards instead if they had 64GB size.Update: Bought two 12/2012 and one year later with very light use one of the cards started locking up the phone with ""wait or close"" prompt when deleting files off of it.  Should've gone with Made in South Korea Samsung card.  Sandisk is garbage these days."
4.0,"Works great. My drive fits snugly and it encloses everything well and keeps my drive safe.<br /><br />I don't love that it has a standard USB connection on the case, instead of the more standard mini USB. I have tons of mini USB to USB cords lying around, but only the one usb-usb that came with this case. I knew that before I bought it, obviously. But this wast he best cost and had the best reviews. 10/10 case with a fantastic price, but a more standard connection cable would be nice."
1.0,"The screen failed after one week , It was the wrong screen for my computer , not Amazon's fault"
5.0,Replaced same mb that only lasted one year. Lets see how long this one lasts
1.0,"I am hoping that I received a defective product and that my experience is rare, but this product did not work as intended. I was replacing another 32G micro sd card thinking that, because this is a Class 10 rated product, it would be faster. It never worked correctly. It kept dismounting unexpectedly, losing data, and was just not worth the money AT ALL! I ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day I bought it. I only wish this product had done the same."
2.0,"This product simply didn't work correctly.  If plugged into a USB 3.0 header on  mainboard, the USB port would work, but the card reader slots would not.  Even plugging in the connector with an adapter to a USB 2.0 header did not make the card slots read.  And the lights never came on.  Simply defective."
1.0,This does not work! I placed it in my phone and it would not show up at all. My phone reads any other card I put in except for this one. Would have returned it except I ripped the packaging and threw it out never thinking it wasn't going to work.
4.0,Just got this on August 28. Nice tablet. Pretty quick. Front speakers are great.<br />I'm am a little upset that I just saw it at Best Buy for $50.00 cheaper.
5.0,I just got a Note 3 and while 32gb is great...who wouldn't want another 64gb?  This SD card does what I want it to do and I'm happy with it.
4.0,To long of a shipment window.
1.0,"Bad assemble, barely works."
1.0,"VERY DISAPPOINTED, IT IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD AND THE PORT IS LOOSE AND IT WON'T CHARGE. I PURCHASED A 64 GB AND SPENT MORE ON IT, THINKING IT WOULD LAST ME A LONG TIME.  NOW I HAVE TO REPLACE IT. I was offered a $15 dollar discount on a replacement which amounts to $11 less than I originally paid."
3.0,"Not bad, but could easily be a lot better.  There are several quirks that just lower the quality of the Chromebook experience.  For instance, I use a mouse with mine.  Works great that way, except for interference from the touch pad.  The touch pad is at the regular level as the surface of the Chromebook, but the keyboard is recessed below that.  So, when I type, if my hand even slightly brushes the touch pad, the cursor goes off flying to where I DON'T want it.  Sometimes, the accidental touch causes even worse.  Could be solved with a simple hotkey combination to disable the touch pad.  Another annoyance; when I first open the chrome browser, it opens my 3 home screens.  If I close it, when I reopen it again, it opens what IT wants, not what I want.<br /><br />Like I said, &#34;quirks&#34;.  A bit more thought needs to be put into this."
5.0,"5 months ago I placed this in a Galaxy phone and instantly increased storage by 200 percent. Worked and still works perfectly, and I was able to move all my pics, videos, and e-books to it. freeing up internal storage for apps.  Recommended."
2.0,"I didn't really need a screen protector that goes all the way to the edges; I just wanted to remove the mirror like quality of the screen.<br /><br />I'm very good at installing these things (I use a &#34;clean&#34; bathroom with no dust etc. air spray bottle etc.) and this time was no exception but it is impossible to remove bubbles when the edges of the guard are flush with the screen—air invariably creeps in under the edge and once it gets in there is no way to reseal it. I tried to cut the borders with a very sharp X-Acto blade but imagine my surprise when I peeled off the cover film to discover that the screen guard was just as glossy as my screen!<br /><br />Pretty useless, all told."
2.0,"This case is effective as a covering, but does not do well as a stand."
4.0,The product was fine. Nothing was wrong with it. As the dimension was not mentioned it did not fit to my iPad which is 24 cm by 17cm (9.6 in by 6.8 inch). I still want to buy the same product with the  size of my iPad.
3.0,"This iPad cover fitted perfectly on my iPad 3, but the corners were sort of hard to fit in at first. This ipad cover didn't hold up as much as I wished it had. The leather started to wear off by the tab and edges after 6 months. I thought it would hold up since belkin is a good brand that I have bought other products from. It wasn't as durable as I expected it to be but it was good while it lasted."
2.0,Pales in comparison to the Targus (PAUK10U)<br />The PAUK10U is more durable and comes with a built in USB hub.<br />This item worked well for about 9 months and then certain keys began to no longer function when pressed.
2.0,"Kept dropping connections, and the 'beam-forming' never seemed to work. Sent back."
5.0,"Bought two of these for me and my daughters Samsung Galaxy S3, and they store so much on them. I love my phone even more."
4.0,"The keyboard connected quickly to my iPad.  It feels good in the hand.  The cover attaches to the unit with a magnet and is hinged so you can use is flat, tilted, or removed. You still have to use the onscreen touchpad for things like sending a text, but at least you can type messages easier.<br /><br />The keyboard has good tactile feel.  The keys take a bit to get used to, since it is a compact keyboard. The keys controlling play/pause work but the fast forward/back don't with either Netflix or YouTube.<br /><br />I've only used this with an iPad. Not having function keys makes it unacceptable for use with a windows machine.<br /><br />I recommend this keyboard with reservations."
2.0,"I had to return it because although described to fit my Kindle, it did not.  So far I am please with my first time's Amazon's return procedure.<br /><br />I have ordered a replacement which seems to have a better description."
3.0,"For $800-$900, I don't wanna get heavy weight laptop, slow hard, average battery.<br />I don't recommend it"
5.0,Nice product very helpfully . We believe in this products san disk if we need more we do not hesitate to buy another one.
2.0,"Sorry, not even worth the low price that I paid. I've these about a month and the wire which is at the connector that goes into the game controller is already exposed. I will pay more to get more, next time."
2.0,wireless feature will not work but plug it into a cord and that's okay. But I got it for the wireless feature. So it was a bad purchase.
4.0,after having and using this for a while i definitely enjoy it. my only problem is that you have to have the volume all the way up and the base almost all the way up for the light in the sub to glow
3.0,The keys don't really work when you press on them they won't appear so you have to do it multiple times. I got the wrong charger that wasn't for the key board
3.0,"I was recently offered two of the latest 32GB MicroSDXC cards from Sandisk (the product on this page) and [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY]] free to review, and of course, I accepted.  Additionally, I threw in one of my own personal [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC cards]] to make this a triple comparison review.  MicroSD cards are a common storage media today used in various phones, tablets and action cameras like GoPros, so I'm going to focus this review on the read/write speed of the cards.  I speed tested all of the cards with CrystalDiskMark 3.0 using a [[ASIN:B009D79VH4 Transcend USB 3.0 card reader]] on a USB 3.0 port.<br /><br />(Also see below for the attached screen grabs of the results).<br /><br />The PNY card scored well achieving its promised 90MB/second read speed and a very respectable 55MB/s write speed well in excess of UHS Class 3 (which specifies 30MB/s minimum write speeds) which makes the PNY card suitable for recording 4K video.<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB High Speed MicroSDHC - P-SDU32GU390G-GE]]<br />Sequential Read :  90.912 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  54.702 MB/s<br /><br />In comparison, [[ASIN:B010Q57T02 the SanDisk Ultra 32GB card]] didn't do so well...<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B010Q57T02 SanDisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDHC - SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA]]<br />Sequential Read :  82.132 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  15.359 MB/s<br /><br />While the read speed is good, for many applications, including still and video photography, its all about the write speed.  Unfortunately this particular SanDisk card I was offered for review doesn't cut it - and as of the time of this review, this is one of their latest cards.  I know they have faster cards, but they also charge A LOT more money for them.  Additionally, I've had bad luck with SanDisk cards in the past including write errors using higher-spec SanDisk Ultra cards in GoPros, and my previous Android phone would randomly dismount the SanDisk Ultra card I was using at the time - and it was a top of the line card at the time... so I'm not a SanDisk fan.<br /><br />What I am a fan of is the third card in this triple comparison review, the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]].  They are super fast, they have been ultra reliable, and they are reasonably priced (The last one I purchased was $34.99 in November, 2014).  This Samsung card beats both of the others in the all important write speed and is only a fraction behind the PNY in read speed:<br /><br />CrystalDiskMark 3.0 - [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC - MB-MG64DA/AM]]<br />Sequential Read :  87.806 MB/s<br />Sequential Write :  75.562 MB/s<br /><br />So if I had to choose, I would take the Samsung Pro card, hands down... and I have!  In fact, I own five Samsung Pro MicroSDs and two full size [[ASIN:B00IVPU6BY Samsung 64GB PRO SDXC cards]] that live in my phones, tablets, DSLR and GoPros.  And since I started using them over two years ago, I haven't had a single issue or incident like I have with SanDisk cards in the past.<br /><br />So while this may be a review for the SanDisk Ultra 32GB card, I'd say there are much better cards for the money.  If you're looking for a fast MicroSDXC card, you should consider the [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 32GB card]] (also available in 16 & 64GB) or if you want the fastest write speeds and proven reliability, consider the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]], which is also available in 16 & 32GB varieties (see important update, below).  If all you're interested in is storage capacity and write speed is not a consideration, then I'm sure the 128GB & 200GB Sandisk cards will work for you, but writing to them is going to be a long, slow process.  (Though, you should also consider the [[ASIN:B00XJKL1ME Samsung Evo+ 128GB Micro SDXC card]] if you looking for a 128GB card).<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE, 11/09/15:<br /><br />It has come to my attention thatSamsung may be in the process of replacing their Pro line of cards with a Pro+ line of cards.  I see that the [[ASIN:B00IVPU88U Samsung 64GB PRO Micro SDXC card]] has limited to no availability at this time and as such is being offered at ridiculously high prices by 3rd party sellers.  The new Samsung Pro+ cards do not have a single product page at this time, but rather the first ones are also being listed by 3rd party sellers, [[ASIN:B01273L37G here (32GB)]] & [[ASIN:B012DTJ8NU here (64GB)]].  Personally, if you are interested in the new Samsung Pro+ cards, I would wait until Amazon itself has them in stock so that you know you are getting a genuine (not counterfeit) card and the price will likely be better, too.  If you can't get the Samsung card, you should consider the [[ASIN:B00W77CIZ4 PNY U3 Turbo Performance 64GB]] card as it is still superior to the Sandisk card in this review.Samsung may be in the process of replacing their Pro line of cards with a Pro+ line of cards.

1.0,Too expensive.. $400 for $200 product?
5.0,"I bought this extra memory for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  I wish I had known when I bought my phone that Android changed its memory management technique between Gingerbread and Jelly Bean!  Verizon sold me a 16GB Samsung S4.  I didn't do much research since my old phone broke and I was about to leave on a business trip the next day.  Come to find out, there are 32 and 64GB versions of the Galaxy S4!  I never asked Verizon if they even carried different versions.  Well, I figured that wouldn't be a problem... I'll just put in a 64GB Micro SD (TF) Card and I'll be all set.  Unfortunately you can no longer transfer Apps to the Micro SD Card.  Some apps can store data on the SD Card but there is no longer the ability to ""Move to SD.""  Since I travel internationally, I use a lot of GPS mapping software and would like to download multiple Gigs of map data for offline mapping.  As of now, I can only download this to my phone's 16GB memory, and not to this 64GB memory card!  Pictures (except for burst photos), videos and music can all be put on the 64GB SD card.  All that being said, this memory card works well, and is priced on par with all of the other comparable cards on the market.  If you've got the cash and need the space (for music, videos/movies and/or pictures--just not apps) then I recommend picking one of these up."
1.0,Did not work at all.  Driver issues.  Software will not load.  Also attempted to load software from website.  That wouldn't work either.  Had to return to Amazon for a refund.
4.0,"My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.  Still satisfied, since I have more than 90GB of storage on my phone."
4.0,"Works great on mac @ USB3 speeds even with mixed devices attached. heavy base keeps it up right with multiple cords plugged in, PS seems ok. I've been ok with several USB3 HD's all running at once.  downside is they copied stiff apple cable for OS and USB3 so they are a pain. tend to be too stiff and do what they want rather than allow easy positioning.  We'll see  how long the PS lasts as thats usually the weak point with this things.  UPDATE1 : appears non functional after week of use. ok plugged it into USB2 port on older mac. drive attached to it came to life. moved it back to MBP with USB3, now it works. flaky ! seems like USB2 resets something in the hub hardware so it works again.  UPDATE 2: after posting this review, some one from the company contacted me. he sent me replacement unit that is working fine after a week or so of use. it looks like I just got a bad unit, that happens, but they stood behind the product and gave me no hassle replacement. thanks !!!! wish all companies took care of their customers this way !"
2.0,Doesn't hold a charge for very long. The charge cord that it came with sometimes doesn't work. This is unfortunate since my daughter loves this. Frustrated.
1.0,"Broke after only a few months of intermittent use, initially it was great but the button started sticking and now the button to switch doesn't function at all."
4.0,It works great.  I bought this after I tripped and broke the ethernet port on my laptop.  I prefer a cabled connection when large data backups.  This works great.
3.0,Great
1.0,"Had problems confirmed by a local computer repair company at a cost of $70, have to return it. To be fair, the repair company said that this particular motherboard is usually very good, and they recommended that I just get the same board from a different vender."
5.0,"Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn't a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in."
1.0,Had to send this screen back. It has a 40-pin connector. My Dell E6540 has a 30-pin connector.
2.0,The Bluetooth portion doesn't always work and disconnects frequently.
5.0,great
5.0,"What can I say . . . ? It's a SanDisk Class 10! They have been making SD, USB, and micro SD cards a long time!"
3.0,"First one I got worked well for a couple weeks, then completely stopped connecting to any device. Anker was good about sending me a replacement, and that one worked pretty well."
5.0,I had no problems installing this into my phone.  The phone picked it up automatically and worked great.  It fit perfectly into Sim slot.
4.0,"I would have preferred it some other color than white, but it served the purpose."
3.0,Good-looking Case.
2.0,"I bought this drive when it was on sale. I thought it was a good deal for the price, but I am disappointed in the drive's performance. Anytime that I copy a large file (over 1 GB) to the drive, the drive stops working partially through the transfer. If I take the drive out of the computer, it is really hot. Once it cools down again, the drive works. It doesn't seem to affect reading files, but it does make it rather useless to store data. I've tried 3 computers and all display similar results.<br /><br />I guess I should have known that I would have problems: I had used a similar 16 GB SanDisk drive before and it failed early as well. I will likely try to RMA this drive."
4.0,"As many other users noted, one of the joysticks is guaranteed to start squeaking, even after light use (less than 3 days). I took the controller apart and lubricated it, though, and the squeaking stopped.<br />It's not the most comfortable of controllers to use (my old limited edition TRON controller had ergonomic touches to it), but it gets the job done, and you get used to it. The USB works just fine with laptops, and the installation process is fairly simple, thanks to the disk. I can confirm it works with Skyrim (from Steam). I didn't do any syncing with Steam to use this controller though; I simply plugged it in and played, with no issues."
2.0,"This PC can't really run newer games (Insurgency, War Thunder, Heroes and Generals, Europa Universalis 4, these games I've had big problems playing. I have to"
3.0,"The battery doesn't fit perfect, looks the same as the old one."
3.0,"This is a great card. The FPS with this card were incredible. I ended up needing more memory, so I bought the SanDisk 64 GB card."
5.0,"You get a lot of storage at a small price. the micro sd with adapter, class 10 so it's fast . I am happy with this purchase and You will be too. I hope this review is helpful!"
4.0,The stylus brook quickly. The tablet works good but it is hard to find a good keyboard and case for it that is not too expensive
1.0,"I have exclusively used Sandisk Extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have NEVER let me down. This one is a dud, though. I plugged it in, let my phone format it, and then start copying to it. Everything copied just fine, but after I got done, that's when it started acting up.If I had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device, I got tons of CRC errors and/or messages saying that I needed to format the card before using it. The phone would come up from time to time saying that I had inserted a blank card. If I reboot the phone, it works fine for a little bit, and the errors would start again. I thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted, so I tried to format it on the computer, but that didn't help anything.Very frustrating! Thankfully I've had it for 2 days before the trouble started, so it's going back to Amazon for a refund and I'll have to find a more reliable card for my phone."
5.0,great
1.0,"I put on my galaxy avant, and always show notify  Damaged SD card. Hopefully I can get a replacement for this SD or any solution.<br />Please respond asap."
2.0,"I bought two of these. The first, purchased in 2013, is still working. The second, purchased in April 2014, lasted 15 months then died. Not sure what went wrong with the second one, but seems to me it should have lasted longer."
2.0,It's a good pen works on most touch device but MAJOR LIMITATION IS LACK OF PALM REJECTION. IT MEANS THAT ONE HAS TO WRITE KEEPING HAND IN AIR & MUST NOT TOUCH THE SCREEN
5.0,SanDisk is well know brand. The MSD Ultra 64 GB class 10 is the good one to buy.It transfers file faster than other brand card. I bought two of them when they are on sell.The price is very reasonable. I like it very much.
1.0,"product was not ipazz as described, must be a cheap knock off"
4.0,Does the job
5.0,Use it to store music and stuff in the cell phone...have had no problems or bad sectors.The included adapter is great for using it in the computer
4.0,I put this card into an Alienware M17x R3 using a modified bios and tweaked drivers. It works great only thing is the seller didn't include the X-bracket.
1.0,"No matter how many times I tried, I could not get it to install properly. My monitor would not recognize the card. I have used Radeon products in the past without any problems. Could not figure this one out."
4.0,Looks great but beware:  It is very hard to put on.  My husband was able to get it on after I tried 3-4 times.  I was ready to send it back but he said they just fit really tight!
1.0,Did not work
4.0,"This is a pretty well made case, albeit a Chinese import. It's semi-rigid, fits the WD Ultra drive perfectly, has two sections to divide your properly secured drive from its cable and has a reliable zipper. Aside from a lower price, there isn't much more to ask for. However, I still would not recommend carrying around any hard drive (which has movable parts) with precious data on a regular basis. A flash drive is a much safer alternative for that."
3.0,This battery doesn't hold a charge as good as i think it should but it does work. I received it in good time. Have had really no problems with this product.
2.0,"After about a month the case had cracked on the corners and had other places where cracks were visible.  It looks good, but the quality is not what I had hoped for."
5.0,"So far, so good. Took me minutes to set up.  I live in a three story house with the wireless on the bottom floor so I had trouble getting a good signal on the second and third floors to stream netflix or Amazon. This little unit solved that problem. I was able to set up on the second floor and boast the signal.  Disclaimer-I haven't tried it on the third floor yet as I have no &#34;smart&#34; TV's up there but the signal on the second is so strong I have a feeling it would work."
1.0,"This unit reads DVD only. Will not recognize blu ray discs at all. I have tried this with Win7, 8, 10 and Linux. It just does not work."
5.0,This is a nice card. Holds about 29 GB. You can store data on it. It is a microSDHC card.
2.0,Coulod not use it as a &#34;TAB&#34; although it is advertised as so. It is too heavy for its size and does not interface with a lot of ordinary Apps.
4.0,"Perfect fit.  I would give it five stars, but it did not come with instructions.  We had to look up the instructions online."
5.0,"I am using this with my Dell Venue 8 pro 64GB, and it is actually as fast as the onboard flash based ssd.  I can write to it very quickly, an di can read from it even quicker.  I recommend this if you need some additional storage space."
1.0,It burned out when I placed it in my computer.
2.0,Hard to use. Still not able to connect. Not for the beginner. UGH
3.0,Good mouse pad for the money but if there are any small scratches on the feet of your mouse it will drag some of the fabric from the pad and catch the mouse. It is unbearable especially for a gamer. I shouldn't have to have picture perfect mouse feet just for this to work as intended.
2.0,"This comment is more about the seller Link-Tronics Memory of Santa Ana than the laptop itself. Be selective in who you order a used one from and realize it’s hit or miss in what you may receive. If I did it again I would make sure I got a Dell refurbished laptop instead of a used one.<br /><br />I left a negative comment for LinkTronics memory and they replied to the comment offering me to return the laptop for a replacement (no refund offered). Since I only paid $218 plus shipping, and the laptop functioned OK, I decided to keep it anyway and fix it up myself. I was also leery about what I might receive as a replacement, and this laptop had a 1600x900 resolution and discrete graphics – I was expecting lower resolution and integrated graphics.<br /><br />After seeing many 5 out of 5 star reviews for them on Amazon, I ordered a Dell E6420 laptop off Amazon.com from Link-Tronics Memory, 12630 Westminster Ave., Santa Ana. The laptop was advertised by Link-Tronics as “very good” condition. The laptop had a large dent on the top of the case this dent was possibly from shipping I don’t know, several small dents around the edges of the top case that were not from shipping, a large (white with black text) metal tag super glued to the top of the case tracking it against theft and someone’s initials were written on the bottom of the laptop in permanent marker.<br /><br />The laptop had no hard drive screws in it. The hard drive fell out of the side of the laptop when I picked it up. The DC jack was loose. I bought a new case top and bottom cover and another DC jack from ebay. When I disassembled the laptop to replace the DC jack, 5 out of the10 palm-rest screws were missing.<br /><br />Once I had the laptop apart and tried to remove the motherboard, the top left motherboard screw was missing and it appears that the motherboard is super glued onto the daughterboard/case at that point and can not be removed from the laptop, unbelievably. When reassembling it I was also unable to put a screw into that screw hole (it’s filled with glue apparently?). It turned out that the DC jack was actually loose because the DC jack bracket holding it in was bent and loose but I put in the new DC jack anyway and straightened the bracket to make it tight.<br /><br />I bought a laptop screw kit to replace the missing screws, replaced the DC jack, replaced the top case cover with a new one and the bottom case cover with a slightly used one from ebay. I replaced the 320GB 5400 RPM hard drive in it with a 750GB 7200 RPM drive, and installed 8 GB of new RAM to replace the 4 GB it came with.<br /><br />After all the extra time, work and money spent the laptop overheated and shut down after one hour of use. Then I discovered that Dell used a thermal pad between the GPU and heatsink on their E6420 laptops, and the thermal pad was missing from this laptop. So then I bought a used Dell double-heat sink (made for the E6520 but also fits the E5420) to replace the single heatsink it came with and I used copper shims to replace the GPU thermal pad and re-thermal pasted everything again.<br /><br />FINALLY…after several weeks of waiting for parts, several hours of working on it, and spending another $100+ on parts I have a nice looking, great working laptop. The battery however appears to be worn out and I only get one hour and 40 minutes from the battery with light use. I just hope I never have to remove the motherboard as it seems to be super glued into the laptop."
2.0,"First, the case.  The case is constructed well enough and it protects my iPad Air well.  I had recently had problems with another case breaking and I have always had good success with Belkin and the price was hard to beat.  The iPad fits snugly in the case and I have had no problems with the fit and use of the buttons while in the case.  The stand can fall on less than ideal stable platforms such as table.  Using it on carpet flooring for example may not be a stable enough platform to ensure that the stand will not fold in and cause the iPad to fall suddenly.  As long as you keep that in mind, it is acceptable.<br /><br />Next, the keyboard.  The keyboard feel is excellent and the keys reacted well to typing touch.  The problem that I have is that the keyboard is even smaller than the normal keyboard and the keys are not all in the traditional places.  I am not the best typist, however, not having the colon/semi-colon in the right place is very confusing.  You need to look at the keyboard setup.  It will make typing a nightmare.  I have made so many more mistakes than my usual keyboarding snafus and it is directly related to the key spacing.  Since the colon/semi-colon is right next to space bar, the comma/quotations key is also out of place for my memory typing. I typically hit &#60;enter&#62; when I want to hit the comma key and this becomes very frustrating.  I will have to get another case/keyboard because I do not want to have to make such a drastic switch from keyboard to keyboard."
5.0,I just love this because i just got a new smart phone and now i am ready to do some down loading.
3.0,Kinda cheap feeling. Don't really think this is a $9 product.
5.0,"Best price I could find for a high quality Micro-SD for my Samsung S4 cell phone. Every store in the area charged crazy prices for lesser quality cards. Don't even think of buying any sort of card from your cell phone service provider. They are the worst ! Amazon all the way for cell phone accessories. Items like cases, screen protectors , Micro-SD memory cards."
1.0,"Bought it in May.  By August, I had to replace it.  Rubber pads came off bottom, corners were chipping and cracking."
4.0,"Looks nice, but when I plug in my iPhone 5s indicates this charger cable is not Apple certified. Additionally, my charging block heats up beyond normal."
2.0,"I've had this case for only a month now and it is already starting to crack and fall apart. It looked beautiful when I first got it and I was very happy with the quality. That is until the little rubber pegs on the bottom case began falling off a week after. Basically my biggest issue with this case is the bottom half. This was for my new laptop and even with the most delicate care the bottom already has three cracks and the rubber pegs continue to fall off , eventhough I have glued them down twice. Could be so much better."
4.0,Good sized mouse. Love the fact that you can select a single color. Only gripe with it is that you have to keep selecting the color every time you restart your computer. It will for whatever reason reset back to multi color once pc is turned off.
1.0,Did not purchase this item
1.0,It does not consistently work.  I have changed the batteries twice.
4.0,Got this to expand the memory of my son's Go Pro camera.  It does the job for much less than the box stores had it for.
3.0,"Finally decided to upgrade my LG 24' widescreen lcd thats about 8 years old, and I have to say I'm not impressed. I know this is for console gaming but its also going to be used for a PC screen and watching netflix. For anything non-gaming this monitor is average to slightly below average. I'll keep this for my Xbox one but will be getting another monitor for general use I guess.  I know this is marketed as just a gaming monitor, I just thought since it had been so long since my last upgrade that things would look better, not worse, than my aging  run of the mill LG monitor.  Used with xbox one and windows 10 pc 4.5ghz  2500k with GTX 770 (Driver 355.60 - WHQL)   Edit: used d-sub input instead of HDMI for PC use and it looks a little better than my initial first impression."
3.0,Can't go wrong for the price but now I am not too happy with it.  discharge very quickly max an hour use on my Pavilion dm4
4.0,Sound quality is as expected for 10 dollar speakers
3.0,"The battery is working ok-ish, first time charging it & turning it on with the laptop. It's been 10 minutes & it's already at 88%.<br /><br />The battery indicator on the back of the battery does not work at all. It was one of the biggest reasons why I bought this battery.  Will keep updating<br /><br />Can I get an exchange for a working one?"
4.0,"This is probably one of the cheapest keyboards you can buy. Having said that, this keyboard is perfectly serviceable for most users. There aren't any media keys (volume up/down, next/previous, pause, etc.), but if you don't need media keys this keyboard will work perfectly for most users.   EDIT: I have docked it one star after some further analysis. After I bought a new keyboard to replace this K120, I decided it would be funny to rearrange the keycaps. While most of the letter keys could be swapped around, I was disappointed to discover that the F and J key will only fit in their intended spots. In other words, this keyboard can't be rearranged for any layout other than standard QWERTY."
3.0,"I had really hoped this would help me connect to a xfinity wifi hotspot that is broadcast through multiple thick walls on the same floor.  Unfortunately, though it did SHOW four xfinity wifi hotspots, it would not connect at a strong enough quality.  Essentially, all I could do was download email; pulling up webpages was like the old days of dial up.  When I moved to having only one wall barrier it was fine, so the product does work, it just doesn't grab the signal well enough to improve over my built in laptop wifi card.  Easy to return so it was worth the risk."
4.0,Both of these items arrived on time and tested out at 9.8MB/s write and 19.8 MB/s read using H2Testw.exe.(500 MB file size). I would have given them 5 stars if the write-speed was just a bit faster.
5.0,These cards work well with many of our pieces of electronic equipment when we travel.  The price was perfect and none failed. They also worked with the readers we had.
4.0,Worked great... Ultra quiet... Comes with hardware and adapters for any occasion...
2.0,"Hard to review this as the card arrived DOA. Couldn't write to it at all, and it wouldn't format. I returned it and Amazon was great about the credit. I've owned several SanDisk memory cards and they have all performed well and I was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box. I'd read a good review of the Samsung 64GB micro card and I bought that instead. Very pleased with it."
3.0,Buyer beware. This is not oem. It is a very cheap knock off.
5.0,as expected
3.0,was hoping it would make my hulu and netflex work faster and not cut out as much.
3.0,Good tank you
1.0,"TP-LINK is trash. Been having nothing but issues with this product. I run IT for multip Need customer support. HA good luck. Call and wait and wait, and by the way don't forget to press one every few min when they ask you to or they will disconnect the call.<br /><br />Sorry amazon but your getting this trash back.<br /><br />GARBAGE .... AVOID !!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"DO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure.I guess the disk has some problem and I don't bother recovering it, since it's not going to be reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk's CF card in my camera for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.So it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don't put important data in it. Be prepard that it can fail at any time."
3.0,"Seemed ok at first, but within about 2-3 months one of the cords stopped working completely and the other is extremely finicky. Just seems to be &#34;loose&#34; when plugged into the phone or Kindle. I threw one away and have the other as a backup, backup, backup. You get what you pay for with these."
5.0,These are always great...thanks
4.0,"Replaced previous one, screen protector seems a little &#34;loose&#34; compared to last one, it just doesn't seem to be as &#34;tight to screen&#34; as before. However it still functions well and is great for drops."
4.0,good product for the price..
4.0,"Disclaimer: I received the AC750 as part of the Netgear Friends and Family program at no cost.  I have this Wi-Fi extender paired with a Netgear C6300 cable modem/router.  The cable modem is upstairs in a closet and the wifi extender is downstairs in a central location in our house.  So far the success rate of the Extender has been pretty good.  It has definitely extended the range of my C6300 I have; however I have noticed unreliable connections to the dual-band SSID on my network.  I probably am able to get it to connect about 90% of the time correctly.  The other times I fell back to my AT&T signal in the house on our iPhones.  Installation was straightforward and only took 5 minutes to get it going.  For a quick solution to extended your wifi range, you really can't go wrong with this setup."
1.0,"Don't waste your money and time with this product. After 3 months of careful use the right side started failing. This failure got worse and worse everyday. I submitted a warranty claim and it's been a month between &#34;we will process your claim&#34; and &#34;you will be redirected to the corresponding region&#34;. 3 weeks without any news regarding my claim. I don't even want to receive another one as now I know that it will also be defective, as defective as their customer service. I even tried calling and expent 30 minutes listening to the stupid onhold music in the end I just hanged the phone."
3.0,"I bought 2 of these, one still works but the other one broke within 1 month."
2.0,"These are overly sensitive and cause a tremendous amount of handling as they turn single clicks into double clicks and open documents or send e-mails you were only considering to take the next step on. I've tried adjusting the double click setting, but still not finding the proper balance. If I can't these may be returned as the number of inadvertent click throughs are causing me a tremendous amount of difficulties."
1.0,"When i got this memory card, noticed the writr protect lever was hard to move. Instead of just sending it back I tried to meve it and the mdmory card broke on hslt.I hanve many SNdisk cards and havd had no troible with them. I guess I just got one that missed wuslity conttol on the line.Dont want to buy another but what do you do."
5.0,wow the sound is great!!
1.0,"Did not work, third piece of equip I have ordered from Amazon that did not work. My last Amazon purchase"
5.0,It holds all the stuff I want on it so I don't have to put it up on cloud storage which isn't always reliable.
2.0,"**Update on 5/16/2016** After using this for about 7 months, I am lowering my rating. The one concern I had became a problem. The wire was not a large as my OEM charger, and after 7 months of use, the wires have broken inside the casing near the plug. I know they are broken because I can hold the plug at one particular angle and it will work. It is not the computer, as I have replicated the problem on two different laptops. I am lowering from 4 stars to 2. Not giving it 1 star because I suppose for the price, 7 months isn't bad. I do hate that we have to put up with &quot;disposable designs&quot;.<br /><br />**Original impression**Been using for 5 days now, and it seems to be working great. It has a 90 degree bend plug instead of straight like OEM, but that is ok because I can rotate it away from the DVD slot rather than having to hold the cord away to load a DVD. However, hang onto your original wall plug cord. The one that comes with this is a smaller gauge and shorter. That is my only reason for 4-star instead of 5. But that probably saves them a lot in manufacturing costs for copper wire and keeps the price down low for us."
4.0,Works great on Jambox
1.0,"I bought this a couple of months ago and used it everyday until it stopped working on me a few weeks ago. Every time I would plug this into my iPhone, it would come up with a message saying that this application is not compatible with my device. On top of that, it just broke a week ago (as seen in this picture). This piece of junk is not worth your time or money. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
4.0,It's a jump drive and does what it should do.
5.0,Excellent product . Recommended seller
4.0,"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it."
5.0,its perfect and easy to use and conect fast to the camera its give you 9940 photo and 45m video with sony cam 18mp
1.0,I like the case but the hole for the camera is in the wrong spot above the screen
4.0,"I have had this for only a few weeks time, but so far I am happy with it. I love the 128GB! It is quick to load and download. I dumped the entire contents of my old drive onto this one in no time.[[ASIN:B00HR7FWUC SanDisk Extreme PRO CZ88 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive Speeds Up To 260MB/s- SDCZ88-128G-G46]] The physical drive itself is sturdier than the plastic ones I have had and I like this as mine takes a lot of use and abuse. I actually find this one slightly slimmer than the old plastic ones. It fits nicely into my USB port with other items plugged in next to and above it. I also liked the way my flash drive 'key loop' fits easily through the end. I maybe could have given it a 5, but I have not had it long enough to rate it's longevity. I would purchase this item again."
4.0,"Only been a month or so but best price, quick shipping and MASSIVE storage.  I didn't run speed tests or anything but no issues.  I will edit this review if I have a problem down the road."
2.0,"While out and about in a photo shoot I had this card fail on me. Luckily I'm a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so I only lost a few pictures. Card completely died and had to be sent back to Sandisk for a replacement.The whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk support.I know about memory so I always have multiple cards available and if I'm out for an extended time, spread my work out over cards to minimize risk.What about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories. Sure  they are at fault for not backing up their data. Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I'd say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved. I can't recommend this card though."
2.0,Never have figured out how to make it work!!<br /><br />Hgilbert
4.0,Very nice case for the cost. Fits the tablet quite nicely.
5.0,"I like it! I mean is not unlocked but come on! I don´t need it unlocked to play some games on HD like The Witcher 3, runs fine on a MSI PC-Mate Z97, now running on Win 10 still good, highly recommended..."
1.0,Can't get it to work. It shows a signal but won't let you log on. Tried everything and so did several friends. Customer service was no help either.
5.0,"This case is extremely attractive, compact and completely protects my Kindle Paperwhite (which I have frequently dropped or knocked onto the floor). The magnetic closure ensures that my device is turned off when not in use.  I also have the larger 8&#34; Kindle HD in a leather case, but this case is better by far."
5.0,"Great product, read my full review here - http://blog.alexburn.co.uk/tech-reviews/synology-ds414-full-review/"
5.0,"I use this card to back up some of the files, that I have on my work computer (at home).  and be able to use them on my laptop computer"
2.0,The printing fades soooooo easily. Even worse on the keys you use often. Good concept just need better quality item.
2.0,"Its going back because it doesn't meet spec.Tested with  H2TestW, write speed is only 9.69 MB/s. Read speed is good at 18.80 MB/s. (although Sandisk claims up to 30MB/s)Meanwhile, a class (10) 32GB Transcend SD card I have writes at 15.30 and reads at 18.20.I also have a few class (6) 4GB Sandisk microSD cards writing at 15.40 and 15.50. Reading speed is 18.40 and 18.30.I also have a class (4) Kingston card that beats this class 10 Sandisk."
5.0,"I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, and it has worked seamlessly. I use it to store movies to watch while travelling, and haven't had an issue yet. The transfer speed is great and Playing movies from the card has not been a problem."
1.0,I returned this item because it made very loud noise and will not burn CD.
3.0,"It's a great product in theory, but in the end it wasn't for me. This is my first mac computer, and my old Windows laptop keyboard was full of dog hair (yay for having labs as pets), crumbs, dust, you name it. I decided to get this and put it on my new mac before ever using it, this way I could get used to the new keyboard with it being on. From the start it felt weird to type on, and I was making a lot of typos mainly because the silicone just doesn't bend enough to fully register you're pressing a key. The light does still shine though the cover, but only just, and only noticeable when there's no other light in the room. I'm going to scrap this cover because it's just too weird to type on, and now that I'm typing with it off, I'm loving seeing the actual backlit keyboard."
4.0,"Item description states &#34;DD-WRT preloaded&#34;.  I ordered it from a reseller, and DD-WRT was not preloaded.  The stock Buffalo firmware was loaded, so I had to install DD-WRT.  That was a chore that took several hours.  However, once it was loaded and setup it worked great.  It may be preloaded if purchased directly from Amazon, but my product was not."
5.0,"I purchased this card to be inserted into my new Blackberry Z10 smartphone. at first the card wasn't recognized, but after formatting from exFat to NTFS (I know, I know, the warnings told me that hell would open up and eat me if I did this, but im not scared at all) it worked flawlessly.  would buy (and reformat) again"
4.0,very good
4.0,"I know armed with this in my Android tablet and wearing my three wolf tshirt, I will be the envy of all geek girls who will be uncontrollably attracted to my Asian maleness."
5.0,work as expected. used to hook an old monitor to my new Dell micro PC.
1.0,"Purchased for my galaxie 3 phone and it fits and works. Not much else to say. ok, the price was good.Update 06/24/13It stopped working! All of a sudden my phone started alerting me that the sd chip was mounting and dismounting. Caused the battery to drain in a few hours. Everything on the card was lost. I attempted to re-format in my laptop. Card was not found by laptop.Googled the issue and found many blogs of others experiencing the same problem.I will attempt to return to Amazon."
1.0,Does not charge batter on think pads
4.0,like it
4.0,"Excellent quality and performance.  The only downfall - No ability to use your own choice of DNS server (ie openDNS). Truth be told, I would not have purchased this modem had I known this."
3.0,This mouse falls somewhere on the line between horizontal and vertical. Depending on the severity of your carpal tunnel this mouse may not be vertical-enough to provide pain relief. I found it didn't help my hand pain at all because it was too horizontal to be effective. However my husband tried it out and loves it. He found it extremely comfortable to use.
5.0,The case worked very well
1.0,"doesnt work, should have been returned although I didnt want to go through the hassle"
4.0,Order a new one. had to send back the used one i bought.  - used one didn't even charge.  the new one can charge my iphone 6 up to 3.5 times fully before having to recharge.
2.0,Good
1.0,This isn't a &#34;mousepad&#34; It's a small clear file.
2.0,When searching for a HDMI cable  this came up 1st<br />This is a USB cable not what i thought it was so my bad but when searching for a HDMI i would think thats what would come up<br />My mistake but not happy
2.0,The television screen flickers lines on the screen when the elgato is hooked up the the tv.
1.0,It's probably backed by fake reviews. I don't know. It worked surprisingly well for the first month and now it's a reminder of what people can get away with selling on Amazon. Waste of money.
5.0,"Bought two of these. One for my Galaxy Note 3 and one for my wife's Samsung Charge 3.No pre-formatting was required. Simply take out of the case, pop into your phone, and they were recognized within seconds. Actual space is 59 gigabytes and some change, which is right on the money."
5.0,This is a very good product because it fits perfectly for my tablet and it came on time
2.0,"I actually like the way the mouse feels in the hand -- it's light and tracks nicely, and is a good replacement for those who like the feel of the Microsoft Intellimouse Optical (the Kana is a little smaller than the Intellimouse, the Sensei a little larger).  My only complaint about the hardware is that the L and R buttons take a bit too much force to click (I like a very light force).  Supposedly this is corrected in the Kana V2, which uses a different brand of switch.<br /><br />So why two stars?  I did so to call attention to SteelSeries' striking misrepresentation of the functionality of their software. Before purchasing it, I checked SteelSeries.com to make sure the software would work with OS X Yosemite (10.10).  According to the website, the Kana requires Engine 2 (they've not yet gotten Engine 3 to work with it), but the website assured me that Engine 2 works with &#34;Mac OSX 10.7 or newer.&#34;  Unfortunately, after purchasing the Kana I found that Engine 2 could not recognize the mouse.  After some email back-and-forth with Brendan M at SteelSeries technical support, I finally got this piece of information in an email on August 26, 2015:<br /><br />&#34;Unfortunately none of our SteelSeries Engine 2.0 software or drivers are compatible with OS X 10.9+ yet.We are working diligently to release be ready for the release of the retail client. We are working around the clock to get these updates out to our customers as fast as we can to minimize the downtime our customers are experiencing. As soon as the software and drivers become available they will be posted immediately to our website in the download section.Thanks for your patience and understanding.Regards,<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Brendan M<br />SteelSeries Support&#34;<br /><br />Now this is all very polite and apologetic, but the fact remains that, even after he sent this email -- clearly indicating that SteelSeries knew that the software didn't work with Yosemite, the website continued to claim itdid (see attached screenshot, taken August 26, 2015).<br /><br />The bottom line is that they're not being truthful, and as a result wasted a lot of my time.  I returned the Kana."
1.0,"After a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenAlso, the I/O speed is not amazing, even for a Class 10"
4.0,goo sound  clear.
3.0,There's not a hole at the bottom that allows me to leave the case on while charging it.  The keys get stuck to the leather and come off easily.  My tablet doesn't fit as snug as another case that I had.
3.0,"I was hoping for a more authentic feel.  Still, it's not bad and certainly better than any other stylus I've used."
5.0,I bought this for my 1 year old since her dad think it would be cool to give a 15 months old a ipad air. This case is life! My daughter has thrown her ipad quite a  few times but this case has it well protected & cushioned inside. I absolutely love it. Got the pink which is simple beautiful.
2.0,I like the material and the handle. Also the memory card pocket and card slots come in handy while I travel. The sizing is just a little off causing the camera to be partially covered by the cover. When I use it to Skype I have to hold the tablet in place to allow my family to see more of me than the tablet cover. I have purchased another cover to replace this one.
3.0,Works well.  Suited it's purpose.
3.0,I'm glad I purchased it but I'm having issues with the volume. I have to lower the volume almost all the way down to get it at a reasonable level. It's annoying but manageable so it's worth the money to get it.
3.0,The only thing I don't like about this is the 90 by the ball/swivel. If that were a hinge or optional straight this product would be the shiznit. It really limits where I can locate the mount and still have it hold the iPad Air 2 at a decent enough angle to still be convenient.
5.0,"No problem; it fits and it seems fast.  The colors are a good addition because when it pops out on the floor or something, you can find it."
3.0,Works as expected.
5.0,"I was afraid to buy it for so many comments saying it doesn&#8217;t work with hero3 at high resolutions video, but it was not my case."
4.0,"In some situations, depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in you'll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that doesn't come native to windows.  Also, the card gets extremely hot under heavy load."
3.0,"Descent headphones.  Good for gaming such as trying to hear bullets fly by and for music; But, its missing the bass and may sound somewhat flat when watching movies.  Treble is very good on the other side and bullet like sound should be crisp.  On the downside the volume knob is very tiny it would have been better if it were in the headset.  The headset also feels like it was made for a kid's ears.  Over time you'll have to re-adjust it and may give you discomfort on the ears since it won't cover the full ear."
5.0,"I have this regularly plugged into my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet as extra storage. But with the included adapter I can also plug it into my laptop. So I use it as a sort of &#34;sneaker-net&#34;, allowing me to move 30 GB of data to what ever I am using at the time. It is filled mostly with pictures and movies. The speed of this makes it convenient for transferring large amounts of data. I'll be buying another one of these in the near future."
5.0,"This keyboard is lightweight, easy to setup, and I've had no problems so far."
2.0,This might be my 3rd 32 GB disk that I buy from scanDisk.They work for few months and then NOTHING...My tablet wont detect them anymore... my computer wouldn't either.Quite disappointing.
1.0,Purchased this and it didn't work right to start with. Couldn't do much with it.... Didn't like the OS either.
1.0,"Within an hour of using the memory card, it failed and died. it kept saying &#34;Memory error.&#34;I could never get my dashcam camera to record anything. I went to our walmart and got me just MicroSD not Ultra. It has been working all day so far.That's right. There is no way to tell what you are getting online is OEM or knock offs. When the price is too good to be true, it probably is - made and distributed by Mofia. LOL.Although the package arrived on time, I will never buy this product online or from this seller on Amazon. Waste of money."
2.0,"It was a great tablet at first, but the issues it has ruin it for me. The wireless adapter cuts out randomly to the point where wifi setting can't even be accessed without a restart. There is barely any of the memory available for use. I had about 27 GB available after upgrading to Windows 10 before installing apps and programs. It often freezes and I'm not crazy about the screen resolution.<br /><br />The writing experience is great. I love the pen and it's speed and accuracy. If it didn't have the aforementioned problems, this tablet would be absolutely perfect but I need across the board functionality. I'm most likely going to send it back."
2.0,"I brought this for school. I am taking my classes online & it ebooks are cheaper. I am attending Wilmington University & the ebooks from the bookstore uses an app that the fire is not compatible with. Long story short I feel like it was a waste. It is a nice tablet, just is not good for what I need it for"
2.0,"I am disappointed because I feel like I have been had by the sales marketing fine print again.<br />I was under the impression I was purchasing a 10 port hub which would charge all 10 of my devices at once, my bad.<br />I should know by now to read between the lines."
5.0,Works perfect. Plug and play.
3.0,"Not as great as I was expecting it to be. I still kept it as I hope I will adapt to it, but so far it is awkward to use."
2.0,It does not recognize my printer
5.0,"Using it with my HTC One Max, and had no problems using it at all.  Write speed is excellent when taking picture, and no delay is encountered at all."
2.0,Very different from Kindle and more difficult to navigate. Cannot figure out where my listing of purchased books can be found and whether I have read them completely or not.
5.0,Great price
3.0,satisfied.
2.0,"I didn't care for the texture of the product. It fit well on the watch. Didn't lift. It does add a very slight grainy look, hardly noticeable (I'm very picky). I waited 72 hrs to see if the material would eventually lay smooth, I even tried warming it slightly with a hair dryer. See for yourself. You may like the fact that it truly covers most of the watch face and shows mostly no edge (unlike the glass protector I now use.)"
1.0,nope just nope it didnt even fit my goddam computer
2.0,this cover is not made appropriately for the nextbook. It covers the power button.
4.0,Very nice
3.0,like it
1.0,"Please pleasssse please do not and I mean do not buy this, it is the worse purchase I ever buy on Amazon, the day I got it is the same day I throw out in the bin. It is useless."
1.0,It doesn't stick to your screen.
2.0,"Although the quality seems to be great, it is too bad that it does not fit the charge port opening in the Lifeproof case. Item will be returned."
1.0,Piece broken off after a few weeks use.
4.0,Works well
3.0,"This is not a gaming mouse. It's a fine mouse, but it is just a mouse. The side buttons do not present themselves to the system as mouse buttons. They are directly interpreted as the command they are set to, for example &#34;Back&#34; or &#34;Forward&#34;. You game will not detect them as &#34;Mouse 4&#34; or &#34;Mouse 5&#34;. So, the side buttons are useless in a game."
4.0,"I've been using it for just over a week and so far I've had no issues...not that I was expecting any as I've used  SanDisk MicroSDHC cards before which have worked reliably. These have all been of  varying sizes under 32 GB, this being the largest  size I've ever used.  I've read complaints elsewhere from persons who've had problems with the said brand  which, fortunately, have been few."
2.0,"This may be a great router.....BUT....cannot use without a modem...and this is not a combo modem and router.  The D7 is a combination, but not the C7.  This is not described in description or by other customers reviews....that I found.  Seems it should be in plan sight as is pretty important info.  Now I am being charged $4 to return, which I do not understand with Amazon Prime."
5.0,"Amazing quality and power. Have Asus tablet for a few years and use 6 hrs day, so the Asus bar was set high. Very pleased. No more HP Pavilion 17 inch which I have 3 of and tired of poor quality and run very  hot."
2.0,"It works, but it is WEP passphrase unfriendly and the web configuration software is a bit messed up. I've had this device for over a year and it works just fine on WPA-2 PSK, but when I tried to set it up for my WEP wifi, it insisted on either a 10 hex or 26 hex key, and wouldn't accept a 13 character password. I updated the firmware a couple of times, but never saw that anything was fixed by an update. I recommend the Edimax N300 [[ASIN:B00BZQLBG0 Edimax N300 Universal Wi-Fi Bridge for Smart TV, Blu-ray and Gaming (CV-7428nS)]]. A lot cheaper, easier and better setup, including support for 13 character WEP password."
5.0,"Make sure to format to FAT32 to be compatible with both AOSP and Touchwiz roms. If you're not running any AOSP roms, just pop the card in. It will be formatted to exFAT automatically. I formatted to FAT32 with guiformat in PC and haven't had any issues. *Optional* Search the xda-developer forum for instructions on swapping internal SD card with external SD card and give your phone 64GB of ""internal"" space for those apps that won't move to SD."
1.0,"Ordered it 3 months ago. Have had to replace the batteries twice and there seems to be a short, will not work, have to shake to get the mouse to work. Poor quality, very disappointed."
2.0,It doesn't worth the money. I returned it and will by an Apple IPad air instead.
4.0,Works well.  The ASUS has a few glitches in the firmware but otherwise works well.
2.0,"I've gone through 3 of these with my HTPC.  I love the layout, functionality, etc.  They have no durability, and are buggy.  Parts break, sometimes the mouse just stops working.  You have to switch the mode on it, press some buttons, switch back, and then it starts working again.  The top right section of keys has become very difficult to use... you have to press the buttons HARD to get them to work.  I wish there was another solution that was as aesthetically pleasing and functional as this, because I'd never buy it again.  Logitech- you are a HUGE tech company.  Can't you get it right?"
5.0,Exactly what I need to store my many media files from my son's 1st year in band and my ministry videos.
2.0,"I was installing my first piece of software with this, and right around the end it spit the disc out and stopped the installation."
2.0,2 pack pin adapter.  First one failed at the 30 day mark - making ineligible to return.  Trying the second one to see if it will work.
4.0,"This has been working well for me so far. A little slow at times, but fine for the price. It has served all of my needs-basic web surfing, word processing, Netflix, and a few games."
1.0,"This was a complete waste of money.  I purchased this strictly for us to have a second tablet to use for looking things up while we're in our living room/kitchen area where there is no computer.  This is the Yugo of tablets.<br /><br />First, the screen on this tablet is weird-I don't know if it's because I used the screen protector that came in the package, but you have to hold it just right or the picture looks distorted-it has an odd effect that reminds me of those old baseball cards that you can turn at a different angle and it looks like the player is moving.<br /><br />The place where you plug in the charger is not made very well--when I went to plug it in the first couple of times I thought they gave me the wrong charger because it was so hard to connect the two.  The plastic around the plug was not evenly cut which seems to have been what caused the fitting difficulty.<br /><br />The battery life is probably the worst thing about it, though.  I have only had this thing for a couple of weeks and don't use it that often [because the screen] and the battery drains crazy fast.  For example, I charged it yesterday [because it went from 73% to 2% overnight while turned off] & I watched the battery life drain by 3% as I went to facebook and looked at the news on the visible screen--I didn't even scroll down.  I lost a percentage point clicking from the home screen to facebook, then another percentage point once I got there and a third when I clicked back to home.  And I don't have a lot of apps running in the background, either, I checked.  It's a bit nerve-wracking trying to browse the internet while simultaneously watching the life drain out of your device with literally every click.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I'd get another brand--although this seems inexpensive by itself [minus the case], it's actually pretty expensive for something that fails at what it's meant to do.  Even though I only wanted it to use for web browsing, it is sadly not up to that simple task.  I don't understand how this has good reviews from people who use it for gaming unless they have it plugged in the whole time because it seems like that would drain the battery way faster than internet browsing."
3.0,The range it's too short.
5.0,Didn't expect any problems and didn't have any either.  Great SanDisk quality at a decent price.  Speed as rated.  Happy
5.0,Works well with my new Garin virb elite
3.0,"cord is TOO short - okay if you plug is on your desk, but if on the floor or wall this will be frustrating short.  Mine lasted about 2 years then the plug went bad but for ~ 7 bucks it was worth it"
5.0,"No issues in my little cell phones. works as advertised, priced well, no issues. not much more to say, but Amazon requires few more words ;)"
3.0,Thin material but good photo quality. And the handles are nice
3.0,"First my complaints, this does not seem like it was built for the logitec G27(what im using it for) one the shifter does not properly latch onto the stand and if placed next to the steering wheel it barly fits, I could not figure out how to mount the pedels to the bas but even if i let it rest there, the metal strut gets in the way of breakign and proper foot placement. also the actual table part of the stand does not rotate 90 Degrees  up, thus making the lower rotations of the actual main piece to be useles(this would be done for average height people sitting low). it also takes a lot of work to tweak any of the settings if you have the wheel attached.<br /><br />overall I would probably have looked for something else but im not unhappy with it, just disappointed that it really was not good for my needs."
4.0,good product
4.0,"I got it in the mail today and I have to say, it gives my Macbook Air a whole different look. Its glossy and hardcover/plastic. Fits great, and it IS InCase. I thought it might be another brand... but no. I was surprised. For the price, its a great buy. I hope never to drop my Macbook, but if I do, I hope this does the job!! I'll be sure to return if thats the case. *No pun intended* :)"
2.0,"I liked this case at first, because it's light weight and the kindle snaps right in, it's not held in by straps. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I've had it for less than two months and there are cracks in the top of the case that are getting bigger. I've never dropped it, the only wear it gets is from being in my purse sometimes. It's still useable, but I can tell I'm going to have to get a new case soon. I wish the case were just a little more durable."
4.0,Adequate protection but wish it had a hard plastic back cover.
3.0,"FACT: *Nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives.<br /><br />Even if a true 2TB USB drive did exist (it does not), it would cost you at least ten times this much.  You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded.

Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but teh market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

4.0,No problem here. I use it in my Samsung Note 10.1. It is a little slow writing to it but such are micro SD cards.
2.0,love the color and the build but the top of the item did not stay on
5.0,Upgraded from free mouse pads to this one. Well worth my money.
3.0,"My Droid Razr runs a little slow, is it because of this card?  I can't be sure.  What I am sure about is I put this card into my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition and the video I record comes out choppy.  So I bought the SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB version of this card, and the GoPro works fine now.  SanDisk is normally very good, so perhaps I somehow got a bad Ultra card.  I never returned or exchanged it because the warranty had expired before I tried it in my GoPro and knew for sure the card was slow.  The SanDisk Ultra should work in the GoPro Hero 3 according to the GoPro website, so again, perhaps I just got a subpar card..."
5.0,"I use this on my 32 GB Microsoft Surface RT and it does the job as advertised, so 5 stars.I have used it to extend the storage capacity on the tablet to 64GB for storing documents, pictures etc. There are many articles on the internet that show you how to do that."
1.0,Didn't fit well. Case was not centered. Returned and went with a Speck Case.
2.0,"The product is cheap, but there is nothing else like these.  I bought 30 of them to use in a Bretford iPad Cart that has 30-Pin adapters in it.  I need a cart for syncing iPads in a tech department that can convert from 30-pin to Lightening.  I also need the adapter.... APPLE!.... that is not so freaking wide it won't fit with a case... APPPLE... if Apple didn't have their heads up some where they'd have made their official adapter more like this one so we could actually freaking using it... APPLE!<br /><br />So, I digress... we don't have quality built adapter to use, what so ever and it is Apple's fault.<br /><br />For being garbage, they work.  I expect them to break.  I have such a low expectation I won't be annoyed when these things fail."
2.0,I'm sure it is good for a non-digital application. It is not  right for me since it requires a cable to be run to the device I was planning to use it for.
4.0,IT IS WORKING WELL.  NO COMPLAINS.
4.0,It does a very well job at cooling my computer.  It was just what I needed! The only con is the lights are super bright and shine in every direction. It's an easy fix though - I just put an object in it's path to block the light.
4.0,"Great speeds,  no problems at all so far."
1.0,"Doesn't work freezes once plugged it . I need to return it when I can find the time, must be defective"
4.0,Nice unit arrived very fast does what it says on the tin
1.0,"Did not work for me, instructions not clear either"
3.0,A bad mix between a tablet and a PC. Not windows update to WIN 10<br />!
4.0,"Very nice, good value.  Just wish the hinge piece were a bit stiffer/stronger as it droops a bit when I put it on a stand after folding the cover back.  Mostly I wanted something to protect the front screen and this does it nicely."
3.0,"It's so pretty but not quality. Right away it started to crack. Now, about 8 months in and with very delicate care, it continues to crack. I would still say it is worth the buy, but don't think it will last forever."
5.0,"I bought this to use with my go pro hero 3 black edition. It requires a class 10 MicroSDXC card. So far I've had no issues with it. Fast read/write, came with adapter, small packaging, but that's all it needed! Comes with a nice hard plastic case to keep both dry and together if needed."
2.0,"Bought this product and functioned great, I unfortunately dropped it from about 2 feet; however it was in a protective case) and it cracked the screen, now touch screen does not function at all. Poor design on glass very week buyer beware!"
2.0,"At first, I loved this product.  It was stylish and served a purpose.  Hooray!  However, within a couple weeks, it stopped working so good. Sometimes the cable would have to be plugged into the phone a certain way, and that shouldn't be.  Other times, it just wouldn't work at all.  Style cannot make up for poor functionality."
3.0,there aren't fade options for individual colors and remote range sucks. Besides that it's pretty good.
4.0,"Great keyboard for the most part.  Instead of giving such a long introduction I'll just right down to it:<br /><br />Things I really like about this keyboard:<br />1) It's got mechanical keys that really make typing easier.  I replaced a different one that was more like a laptop keyboard.<br />2) It's fully wired with a long USB3.0 cord.  This basically makes sure there are no mistypes or battery issues.<br />3) The media buttons are simple and very useful.<br /><br />This I didn't like about the keyboard.<br />1) The biggest problem I had is it has a very rough sharp ridge on the front.  It got painful after a while, however, this was easily fixed by buying a separate wrist restpad. (-1 star)<br />2) It sometimes had a little bit of issues with sliding around my glass desk, not enough to remove a star as it wasn't horrible, but beware or prepare to get something to keep it from sliding.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />This keyboard is loud, like throwing legos down a flight of stairs loud.  Don't use this in a quiet environment.<br /><br />Aside from everything, I have no regrets for this keyboard and don't see myself having to buy a new one anytime soon."
3.0,"Was looking for a good on-the-go USB stick that had a fair and competitive pricing. This was on flash sale and had good reviews, so I decided to give it shot. Cant have to many USB sticks around the house, right? This stick worked for me for awhile, but for some reason it started doing some wonky things. While it works most of the time and does what I need it to do, I sometimes have troubles when copying a lot of files or bigger files lately. It will freeze around the 100mb left, and it did this on multiple computers. I have formatted it multiple times and done other IT tricks, but unfortantely it still hangs up here and there.<br /><br />I would go another route if I were to get another USB stick in the near future from my personal experience. However, I would recommend this if its on sale, as I'm sure my experience is just an uncommon fluke."
2.0,"I purchased this product to put in an upstairs room where I could only get one, unreliable, bar of WiFi on my phone or tablet and we have little  cell phone coverage where I live (well more like none). I read many reviews on several products like this one and chose this product because of how easy it was supposed to be to install (supposedly &#34;plug & play&#34; basically).  I had to return the product because I could never get it to connect to the wireless router let alone place in another area to try and extend the router's range. I gave it two stars because I'm sure there's a possibility it could have been &#34;user error&#34; on my part but I tried everything in the instructions (including plugging it directly in with the ethernet cord provided) several times and even had a couple of tech savvy people try to help me with no luck. It may work for others but it's certainly not as simple as they make it sound."
5.0,I bought this for use with my gopro hero 3 silver and I have had no complaints. trhgtr thth h r
4.0,Worked just fine for me. I am not a gamer and I have had no speed problems with this computer.
1.0,"DELL has gone cheap with its AC/DC plugs in the computer. i bought one of this computers and it lasts for only one day. it has burn its power supply detection chip inside the motherboard the first time i removed the power adapter. so i got a computer that now does not detect any power brick as original and refuses to charge it battery.<br /><br />Avoid Dell pcs, their power jack is crappy and may fail on you. (i have already replaced the power jack and tried with another dell power supplu and its not working so something must have burned in the motherboard.)<br /><br />Thanks for the one day computer :( Not buying DELLs again.!!!!<br /><br />Aviod this!"
1.0,Not a good productos. Not a good customer support
2.0,"I had this to extend the wifi in my 1,200 sq ft. Apartment and the wifi has not improved with the extender. I'm giving it 2 stars because I do have full wifi bars with the extender but the connection is still terrible."
1.0,"Way over priced, can be found every where for $25."
5.0,"I ran the Disk Utility function in Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS.  Minimum Read - 13.7, Maximum read 15.1, Average Read 14.9. That's more than acceptable, given the Class 10 designation."
3.0,I was a little disappointed in this product.  I had this same kind of product by a different manufacturer that I think worked much better (I left it out in the rain and ruined it).  I just got it yesterday and tried it on two separate radios.  The one I had before would sometimes make dramatic differences in reception where this one doesn't.  I will update this later after more use.  I think the time of year and atmospheric conditions can affect reception so I'll see how it does over the next few months.
3.0,I was hoping for better sound quality but for the price they are ok.
3.0,I didn't know there was a larger size kindle Fire.  So this is too big for my kindle.  But the case is very nice.
1.0,To slow
1.0,Not happy the keypad worked for all of two weeks and now it doesn't work at all.
3.0,doesn't hit read/write speeds as specified
5.0,This card is awesome. I take a picture on my camera and phone and it is almost instantly ready to take another picture. The transfer between my laptop and phone is very quick as well it almost match my USB 3.0 speed. Also i really like the color of the card. it makes the micro sd card look very unique. Although if you have verizon you may get confused between the LTE card and micro sd card.
2.0,"Product worked for less than 15 months, which was disappointing. I can no longer transfer files to the card (despite numerous troubleshooting attempts). I will likely go with a non-Sony product for my next micro SD card."
4.0,"Its a little bit bulky and the touch have been a little bit slow since I got it, but its very sturdy and protects the device very well. I'm glad I bought it."
3.0,"failed in one month.  Sandisk very promptly replaced, great customer service, and the new card seems to work ok.  I have read that there are some problems with the galaxy s3 so it may not have been the memory module's fault it failed."
1.0,Did not work.
2.0,"I hhate this keyboard.. II will not be correcting typos so that you can  see what i'm  deaaliing with . It duplicates keystrokes and is often oon a delay.  I wishh I would havve noticed it sooner becausee now it's too late to reeturn.  I have had the kkeyboard siince March and havve changed the battery twice.. No surprise, that does not fix the problem.  I gave it twoo stars because the moouse is actually kinda nice."
3.0,"I like everything about this tablet but the reliability.  bad usb and charging ports within 9 months of purchase on one of the three tablets we bought for the kids.  the AC port is just ridiculously flimsy and we've gone through all three chargers in less than 6 months...  Outside of that, functionality has been remarkably good, with little to no slowdown on speed or multitasking..."
3.0,San Disk makes good cards however i thing the price is somewhat high.So I got the 32GB for half the price so i will have to download my pictures twice a month instead of once a month
1.0,"I made a point of avoiding similar but cheaper products because I wanted to make sure I got one that worked.  Well, this one does NOT work!  The first time I plugged it in to my iPad 2, my device showed a message that said this adapter is not compatible.  When I tried to disconnect it, the casing pulled off of the adapter, exposing the wires inside.  I slid it back together, tried plugging it in again then tried plugging it in to my iPhone 4 instead, and could not get a single response more from it.  Fortunately, I haven't had too many busts on Amazon before, but this product is absolute junk, and I was surprised when I came back here and was reminded how much I had paid."
2.0,Not much better than an omni-directional antenna!
5.0,looks great and very cheap
2.0,"I used it for something like 10 months in my Galaxy S III (GT-I9305) with original firmware, mainly for pictures and flac files.Suddenly I perceived that the last pictures I took disappeared; I took some more pictures as I thought that were software problems but same problem until I realized that the card was not working. Now I can't write it anymore or delete information, format it, delete partition, etc. Now is a ROM. The bright side is that I did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card."
3.0,"Honestly this ipad case is not meant for an IPad 1. Its better for an ipad 2. The case is way too loose if you put an ipad 1 in it. It does not cover the power button, and the case moves around with the ipad in it. It does not fit with a snug. Very loose and I cannot even press down on the power button because the case covers it. I love the color though, very vibrant, and the material is not at all cheap. FITS better for an ipad 2!!!"
1.0,The case was nice but it totally screwed up the kindle
1.0,faulty did not work
4.0,"The design feels flimsy, but it gets the job done. Pretty much just a connector and a hollow aluminum shell."
2.0,"Product seemed OK at first.  The touch screen was a little wonky.  Not moving sometimes, other times it would click when I wanted to scroll.  Would overlook that for the good price.  Screen has unfriendly viewing angles where the contrast will make it unviewable.  Stopped working after a week.  If it didn't fail to work, would have been acceptable for price."
4.0,"Fast delivery, awesome product, very good price."
1.0,Very cheap and bad product. It doesn't stay on my MacBook Air keyboard and it comes off when i blow air :(((
5.0,Replaced old keyboard--works just fine--we are happy with it.
5.0,"I used this keyboard to replace the original keyboard after a soda shower and some faulty keys.<br /><br />Installation of the keyboard using the dell manual was easy for me but you do need some fine tools and a steady hand with the flat ribbon cable.<br />Keystroke on this Eathtek keyboard is pleasant, not too soft / hard. From time to time I do miss the backlight which I had in the original"
4.0,"A necessary feature that I really miss is backlight on keyboard side (4 stars coz of that),  usually a dark room and different keyboard layout are not a good combination. I have to have some light in order to use it for typing.<br /><br />+ Air mouse function works great tho.<br /><br />- Another thing that I notice is that if you are using the Air Mouse mode and KODI on an android box, the center &#34;OK&#34; button won't work sometimes, having to disable it and use arrow keys instead."
2.0,Didn't last long &#60;(;o(
4.0,Received it as promised. Inserted it into tables and was acknowledged that it is there.Guess it will work as expected also.
2.0,Lights are cool must sit on hard top surface or the fans won't run.
3.0,"Works fine, but lacks the customizable features. Not compatible with OpenWRT nor DD-WRT. So you cannot expect more from it other than a router."
2.0,Stopped working after 14 months I guess I should have gotten the extended warranty
5.0,I got a Samsung S3 and wanted to get the max amount of memory on it so I decided to get this memory card. I do not regret it you won't run out of memory easy. I have 7 1080p movies on it and I still have a whole lot of memory to spear. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.
1.0,"product did not work, would not charge phone, phone did not even recognize it as connected.  I purchased another product and it worked fine. (YCS Mini to micro )"
1.0,Please do not buy from this company.  They worked for 2 weeks and then they don't charge!!  All 3 of mine do not work!! Total rip off
1.0,"Could not get the extender to pair with router and after a lengthy call with customer service, they could not either.  Returned."
4.0,Great receiver but you might need to look up videos on YouTube to see how to set it up
4.0,"Does everything it is supposed to do just fine.  Nice, crisp display, quick response, and I can read my books in the dark.  Haven't got my cover yet, but it is on the way.  My only disappointment is that it is unable to download books and shop without a wi-fi hookup.  I sort of expected that it could.  Oh, well, maybe next time."
5.0,Proper fit.  It just works...
5.0,"I bought this card because I have several devices that use microSD cards, but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher-capacity SDXC standard. For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated."
4.0,"This is ok, the keys don't light up. you have to unhook it turns into 2 pieces."
3.0,"this bag is amazing, the only issues are, when i ordered it the bag was missing the main shoulder strap and my 15.6 in toshiba laptop fits into it snugly, with little room for the power cords, love the purple color and it is very light wieght"
2.0,"Did not come preloaded with Ubuntu - it had a mis-mash of Win XP, Open Office, etc. Not that it is hard to load Ubuntu, I just selected this system because I assumed if preloaded, I wouldn't have to muck around with finding drivers etc."
2.0,"You get what you pay for, and that is true for this drive as well. I bought four. One was DOA, one showed 115GB and the two others that were OK got worryingly warm when I copied data onto them. I would not recommend these for long-term use. They're slower than other USB 3.0 drives that I've used and I have to question their reliability."
2.0,"Sounds great - works bad.<br />I am using this on a MacBook Pro. THE ORICO should work. It partially works.<br />My mouse is a Logitech M305 USB connected via nub in the computer USB port. The other USB port is the Orico. When the Orico is powered up, I loose control of the mouse. It is Not smooth AND not controllable. When I turn the power off to the Orico, all is great.<br />This is repeatable. I checked all updates and my Mac OS X is completely updated.<br />The problem is definately the Orico.<br />I disconnect the Orico and figured I wasted $$ getting it."
2.0,"The headset is nice, but as others on here have mentioned - the ear piece snaps after about a year of use. Now, the right ear piece dangles off the side of my head, rendering the headset un-usable."
3.0,"I had this folio case for 8 months of heavy use before the hinge failed. I replaced it with a Zagg key case with a different hinge that hopefully will last longer.  The battery lasted only a few days between charges not the several months advertised.  I generally liked the keyboard, which appears identical to the new one, a lot. The bluetooth connection would drop every few days requiring an ipad reboot.  In general, adding this keyboard to the ipad worked very well, greatly reducing the need to move over to a laptop for document creation."
3.0,They are loud but not as loud as I expected.
4.0,"This is the second card I've purchased of this exact model.  The first one I had went bad after about 8 months.  To be fair, I had it in a rooted Galaxy S3 with CM10.1 loaded on it.  So it's possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the card.I'm back on the stock rom now due to issues with 4G LTE.  I'm not even rooted anymore.  So I'm hoping that the card remains solid this time.  Everyone else seems to love it so I'm hoping serves me well for a long time.So far... So good..."
4.0,Convenient if you SD port is acting up.
5.0,I love this product
5.0,Very quick and no problems what so ever. A great storage platform and works great in both my Lenovo tablet and my Samsung phone. I would recommend this to anyone =)
5.0,"I placed this memory card in my Bluetooth speaker, I then loaded it up with different genders of music and it plays beatifully."
1.0,"Did not work, computer would not reconize it."
2.0,"The device screen is broken already, not really child proof......"
1.0,The SD to microSD card adapter that comes with this product is too small. It is impossible to remove the card from the adapter without damaging it.
4.0,good product
4.0,"I love the long cable, but it is a little loose when connected."
3.0,Be nice if it had a longer cord
5.0,Good product
5.0,"I have used this in a number of devices, including mobile phones. When recording HD video straight to the card, I have not encountered the skips, lags or stutters that I have sometimes seen with other cards. So it certainly must be fast enough for this purpose."
3.0,Kindle fires are great. However they never last for long. Been thru 2 so far. But ill be buying a new one again.  At least it seems they fixed the charging problem.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE.  I bought 4 of these units for archival backup.  They get used once a month at best.  Of the 4, I have had two lose all but 500GB of data.  Before Windows did the anniversary update, if the drive did not mount properly, you could just shutdown and re-boot.  Windows must automatically try to fix the drive now.  If the drive does not mount properly, most of your data will evaporate.  You will lose all but a small portion of data.  The drive will test fine, but only a handful of files will be there.  To add insult to injury, Seagate has data recovery software, but wants $99 with a limit of 24 uses in a year.  They create the issue and then have the paid solution to possibly fix it.  Nice business model!  I REPEAT this has happened twice to me with 2 different drives.  I thought the first time was a fluke, but now it happened on a second drive.  I have a Windows 10 machine with USB 3.1 ports and use USB 3.1 enclosures.  This has not happened to ANY of my other (9) drives which are 6TB and smaller of varying brands.  The other drives get much heavier use."
2.0,"Because it's faceted, there is one corner that just doesn't fit well on the iPhone 5.  Overall, it barely fit and seemed to be always at the risk of popping off my phone with the slightest touch.  I returned it.  Too bad so cool looking."
5.0,If you're getting this card it means you're 1337 like me.  Or at least you aspire...Carry on young diamond...carry on.
1.0,"It won't power up from sleep. If unplugged then re-inserted, it will blink briefly then drop out again. The only way out of this is rebooting my PC. The utility app is useless and errors out all the time, so I have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers only, without the utility app. No luck here either. A very bad experience!"
2.0,Having a hard time understanding the operating system. I find myself not using the computer.
3.0,"I like these headphones, but after wearing them for a bit they start to hurt the top of my head. I just purchased the new rgb corsair wireless void headset and that one makes this one feel like a cheap dollar store knockoff."
3.0,Flimsy
1.0,"I'm not sure if the grip to the battery us supposed to be so loose, but I have to position against something to make sure it doesn't fall out. Also the green light has been constant and no sign of the red light that's supposed to be visible when charging. I'll give it a few hours before returning to comment and deciding if I'm going to return it and look for a different product."
5.0,This is so awesome...for a few years I always had the light on...now I don't need too.!!!
5.0,"Like I said, this is a flash drive. It works. There are no data copying or writing speed problems and it performs within manufacturer specs."
5.0,It works like sed it dose it's fast and works in my Xoom and have used it in my hd1010 xacti camera with an adapter.
5.0,"I was little hesitant to order this initially but turned out to be an excellent Product,Did a initial test on CrystalDiskMark.Enjoying it on my ASUS TF101.The shipping was quick too."
3.0,It's flimsy...hopefully that still protects it
4.0,"It fits on the keyboard but i wish there was a way to keep make ot stay easier, bought it for work so i dont get grease on the keys i work in a garage so it will do its purpose."
4.0,It is very bright. I find I need to cover some of the bulbs. Better to be too bright than not bright enough. I would buy it again.
1.0,"After 2 days of use the computer no longer recognizes this drive. It can not be formatted, and I have lost all saved data. I tried to return it, but because I did not use it for a few weeks, it is no longer eligible for return. I may as well have used the money to lite a fire......which is where this drive is destined to end up. Ridiculous piece of equipment."
4.0,"Great item, though it costs more than the devices it is charging/protecting.  Don't know that I would buy again due to this.  I guess if I were housing iPads in there it would be worth it. but for &#60;$100 Android devices the cost just isn't worth it.  It is almost cheaper to just replace the missing/stolen devices."
3.0,"Pros: Somewhat light for a gaming laptop, great performance, doesn't heat up too much.<br /><br />Cons: Screen is kind of tinted so it has bad viewing angles, gets hard disk failure every once in while, I received one with defective speakers.<br /><br />This laptop has a history of hard disk failures and other defects from other customers. Overall it is a great laptop if you can get one that is not defective, but the chances of that are slim. There are other ASUS laptops with better reviews, I would suggest looking at those.<br /><br />I would recommend getting a laptop with a 965m, since it is not that much more and you get even better gaming performance."
5.0,This is great. I use this with my Contour Roam camera. Works great. lots of room for video. Transfer speeds are as expected.
5.0,Really love this iPad case. It’s made of superior material and has a comfortable feel. I have no regrets.
4.0,Lights up my pc and monitor beautifully. Very bright. The adhesive that comes pre-applied is not the best and will start peeling off on the end where the cable comes from.
4.0,Delivered and worked
5.0,Works as it should. i use it with my GoPro HERO 3+ and I have not had any issues. Holds tons of footage. I have 4 of these and it is overkill but they were so cheap that why not. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
4.0,A little bulky but does what it is supposed to do.
1.0,I bought this cooler and i could not get the x bracet to line up in the right holes it sucks do NOT buy it.<br /><br />Can i please have a refund or something?
5.0,Works very well in my smartphone. Great speed. Highly recommended. I use it successfully in my Samsung Galaxy SII phone.
4.0,This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that's all I use.
2.0,"I have been using this portable drive for about a month now and the drive does not stay connected when plugged into my computer.  It constantly goes from &#34;drive connected&#34; to &#34;drive disconnected&#34; even when its stationary and not touched or moved. This is extremely frustrating when I'm trying to install my printer via CD-ROM.  I was hoping it would be as great as the previous reviews suggested, but this was not my experience and cannot recommend this product to anyone."
3.0,The kindle HDX 8.9 is an amazing tablet . I gave the tablet a 3 out of 5 stars because I wish it had more apps to choice from in their app store and also I would of loved it more if I was able to personalize it with my own background pictures instead of amazon automatically placing their own background photos.
2.0,the screws don't fit the back box.  Had to go out and purchase all new screws to have it fit in both plastic and metal back boxes.  Not work the savings.
5.0,"Looks like  do not have a screen protector, great product. Pretty easy to apply as well."
1.0,"This is the card that came pre-installed in my Lenovo computer.  Since day one, it has randomly dropped my internet connection.  I have had to send the computer back once already, and they seemed to have fixed the issue for several months, and then lo and behold, it happened again.  Another quick visit, and then it was fixed again -- for a little.  You will find that it will get worse and worse, to the point that it will RELIABLY drop your internet connection during &#34;peak&#34; internet hours, several times a day.  Your connection will drop and then come back multiple times within the same few minutes, and then repeat within an hour.  Sometimes, it even gets so bad and causes so many internal hiccups that it causes your computer to go Blue Screen of Death on you.<br /><br />In short, find a better card.  This one is only good if you like to be frustrated."
2.0,"*EDIT* I recently installed Windows 10 on my XPS 13 (2015 edition), and now I can no longer use the Dell Universal Adapter. I consistently get a &#34;Code 43, Device Descriptor Request Failed&#34; despite having up to date drivers installed. I have followed every suggestion I could find on Google for how to fix this issue, but no dice. The only reason I'm keeping the review at 2 stars is the device was wonderful when it actually worked. I would not count on this product working with Windows 10 until an update gets released.  This is a perfect compliment to my 2015 Dell XPS 13. I am a graduate teaching assistant, so I consistently present powerpoints to faculty, in addition to teaching undergraduate lectures. My university is a mess of modern and ancient classrooms, so having a small device that is compatible with HDMI, VGA, and ethernet is essential when I don't know which classroom situation I'll be faced with. My only complaint is that the USB port on the adapter is USB 2.0 instead of 3.0. I understand they probably had to make it 2.0 to balance power consumption from all of the ports, but as I only have 2 USB ports on my laptop, it would be nice to maintain 2 functional USB 3.0 ports when the adapter is plugged in instead of being reduced to one. Overall though, this is a great device for graduate students constantly on the move!"
3.0,its not stable case
4.0,Excellent cover.  Good quality.
5.0,"I liked the color; liked that I didn't have to worry about it getting confused with other microSD cards that I had lying around.  It functions as I expected, given that it was made by SanDisk"
3.0,These work great but they are a bit over priced in my opinion. The antenna bend points are also a bit easy to break. I have warned our users about being gentle to avoid breaking off the antenna at the bend points.
4.0,arrived on time all worked well
4.0,"Comfy, easy to clean, and stays cool!"
3.0,"it's a pretty good tablet/laptop. I like it, but the webcam is way lower quality than specified. The video shows up with little tiny purple dots all over. Like if you're skyping, you have purple dots all over u. It's a good little laptop, but i kinda wish i got a different one."
4.0,Small for little hands. nice!
5.0,"Not much to say here except that this is a decently priced product from a reliable manufacturer, you can't go wrong. I use this for my 1st generation Surface RT; I store movies on here and watch directly off the SD Card, works great!"
4.0,good
4.0,Mouse works good but I wish it had a horizontal scrolling wheel
5.0,SanDisk Ultra 32GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS...;  Item is as described.  decent product for its price and quality.  It comes with the small Sd card and a next size up adapter
3.0,The cover looks nice. However if you have kids it's not durable enough. I bought the case and put it on 2 days later my son dropped it and the entire screen shattered.
4.0,"So far so good. Obviously hold a lot of files,music, photos, docs, etc. I'll take the filled up one with me when traveling, for refence and sharing of files. also a reasonable price."
2.0,The elf is a bit flimsy. The two prong plug is hard to keep in the wall and the charger itself separates easily.
1.0,It doesn't work on an Apple ipad.  LIARS!!!!
2.0,This case not only was NOT LEATHER even though it was advertised as such. After a few months it started coming apart between the layers of &#34;leather&#34;.
3.0,It looks like a good protector. But it is stained with some black colour from the laptop bag I use. So be careful if you want to have your laptop with this skin in a dark coloured bag.
2.0,Works fine but NEVER lose the USB power cord. I lost my cord over 8 months ago and I haven been able to find a replacement since then. I've written Wacom Customer Support 3 times asking them to please send me a replacement but apparently they do not make any extras (hard to believe but I guess). Their suggestion was to go to an electronics store to find a USB Micro A or B that fits in their tablet but guess what ... none of the standard sizes do. The plug end of standard USB cords are too big to fit into the Wacom USB port.
3.0,"The plug you sent was great. But I did ask if it would fit nz standards and you said yes,but it didn't so I had to go and buy an adaptor to be able to use it."
1.0,Would not stay at correct date. Kept changing back to one day ahead.<br />Had to return
4.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for myself because I was in need of a new tablet when mine was stolen. When I saw this on sale and saw the reviews I decided to order one. Received it in the mail about a week ago. The 6 inch size is perfect for me and perfect if you are taking this tablet with you everywhere like I do and great to use at home to relax or surgery the web. It runs very smooth on videos and internet. Have not had it crash or be slow. Setting it up was very simple and quick. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I didn't like that I would have had to pay extra to have the tablet come without the ad backgrounds. I didn't choose to pay extra and it's not a big deal but I would have liked having a more customized tablet without having to pay extra.
3.0,A bit flimsy and  i thought what i saw next to it was a styllus otherwise it was ok
4.0,"Most ergonomic mouse I've used, even better than those later in the series. Felt bulky at first, but became very comfortable and now I can no longer go back to a slimmer design. The buttons are all positioned perfectly as well.<br /><br />Some downsides: like other gaming mice, is prone to suffer from the random double-click after a period of time. The left mouse button has begun experiencing the issue and the only way to alleviate that without having to buy another mouse was to download a third-party program (search for &#34;Daniel Jackson MouseFix&#34;). It has helped prevent it from being too frequent, but it still pops up every now and then.<br /><br />The scroll wheel also stopped functioning properly after some time, for which there is no fix. Pressing down registers as multiple clicks; sometimes it must be pressed hard for it to register at all.<br /><br />Issues aside, the mouse would have been perfect."
1.0,"Product is NOT as advertised. There is no Fresco Logic FL1100 Chipset on the board as shown on my photo (blue PCB). Admittedly I purchased this card because I believed that the Card would work for my MacPro3,1 if it had a FL1100 Chipset. Indeed I later purchased an Orico PME-4U card that DOES have the FL1100 chipset (see 2nd photo - dark green PCB); and it works on my MacPro3,1 with OSX 10.10.5. Granted, the card does NOT advertise to work on a MacPro, only Windows PCs.But I knocked the card for false identification/advertising."
5.0,"Very easy to set up for extra hd space for the xbox, works great. No complaints so far."
1.0,cheap.  Get what you pay for.
2.0,Not needed
3.0,It broke after three months.
3.0,Case fits great. Screen protector glass seems to have slight impact on responsiveness when typing etc
1.0,Horrible power supply. Lasted less than 10 minutes. I wouldnt buy another. Bought a corsair power supply to replace and couldnt be happier with it. DO NOT BUY
5.0,"I bought this memory card for my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 521) when my older 8GB micro SD card died on me (amazon basics brand).I threw on some MP3s on there to listen on my phone on my trip up the California coast since I knew some areas wouldn't have any radio or cell phone reception, and had no problems with it.I haven't done any speed tests on it as I'm not using it for anything that needs extreme speeds. Its has more than enough speed for capturing video and and pictures.Its a great deal for the amount of storage and its price."
3.0,"I think this is probably a fine product, but it wasn't compatible with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. Formatted as exFAT (as it came from the factory), didn't work at all, but that's a known problem with the GS3. But even after reformatting to FAT32, the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times."
4.0,"Just got it.  The promotional price was very good.  I was worried as my last android device was a real turkey.  My main purpose for this was as a reader .  It downloaded everything fairly fast and with no problems, from my Overdrive app.  I really need it for traveling.  It's a perfect size  The screen resolution if great.  I am not sure of the sound quality yet, but it expect it to be as good as most apple phones.  Amazon really bends over backwards to keep it's prime customers happy.  I really appreciate the good service."
4.0,"This SD card USED to be one of the fastest. Now it is merely adequate.I bought the 64GB version and inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S5 (latest Samsung phone).The performance, although still adequate, is less than stellar. For example, to load the Amazon Kindle app, which is about 35mb and I purposely placed it into this SD card, it takes about 7 full seconds to load. The same app on my iPad takes around 2 seconds to load.Still, if you aren't too much into your smartdevice performance, then I wouldn't worry. But if you do care about how fast your smartphone can take pictures (assuming your pictures are stored in SD cards) or how fast your apps will load, then you should purchase a much faster SD card for your latest phone.Pros:1)Adequate performance.2)Hassle free packaging.Cons:1)Not the fastest, but still adequate."
5.0,"Use it in Sammy Tab 2, formatted in a HTC phone, then put in in the tab 2......"
2.0,it wasn't the right one. I returned it.
3.0,"I am having some problems with this Kindle.  It's freezing up ever so often and I just have to turn it completely off, wait a while before turning it back on and then it will work for a while longer.  May have to send it back...."
3.0,had to return not satisfied with sound level
5.0,I couldn't ask for anything better. I use it in my GoPro Hero 3. Records a lot of video and holds a lot of pics.
1.0,"Be very careful of this item.  When you go to try to set it up thru the process they recommend it gets you to support, but with added expense to set it up.  Haven't try this on the road yet, works at home but only as an extender, can't setup all the features on it because they tell me that my computer is infected and won't let it happen, and for $150 they will fix it.  There is always something with this electronic stuff, stuff that they don't warn you about before purchase.  Also if you try and download software that is suppose to help you out, there is all kinds of problems with attachments in that software.  If you want your networking to utilize this as just an extender, which it will not hold to automatically startup, then be aware of that feature only.  Very disappointed in Netgear with this item, have had and still have many of their items."
4.0,Recommended 100 % excellent product
4.0,This item works great with the Garmin Dash Cam 10 and Garmin hand held topographic GPS. Good value/deal for the money.
5.0,"I got this for both my phone and camera. Can't decide what to use it in first, LOL depends on what I feel like carrying with me..."
1.0,"This item is very likely one of the many FAKEs being sold out there. Data moved onto it quickly disappears and gets corrupted. Running the well-known H2Testw flash testing program on it generates<br /><br />&#34;The media is likely to be defective.<br />7.7 GByte OK (16354393 sectors)<br />117.1 GByte DATA LOST (245597095 sectors)&#34;<br /><br />In other words, an 8gb card being sold as a 128gb card for $70!<br /><br />I am returning for money back. Don't waste your time.<br />Read about this phenomenon here:  https://www.thecounterfeitreport.com/product/504/micro-SDXC-Memory-Cards.html"
4.0,I like it and just need a cus. ser. rep to ask a few questions as iam not really a android expert.
4.0,"its a pretty big and i can barely fit my side panel back on, but it definately works awesome as the cpu cooler"
3.0,"I was a little disappointed since it came without a box. So, where do I leave the adapter while the card is in the camera?"
5.0,SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class work the best in my dash cams... I bought a Mobile Micro SD Reader to use to read the small cards and it too work great ..
2.0,The case rests on the volumn button.  If it wasn't that I would have loved it.
2.0,"Even though I have used this brand and model of camera card before, this one would not format and I had to return it.  The usual speedy reimbursement from Amazon was appreciated."
1.0,"Worked good for a couple of months, but now says driver won't install."
1.0,Wow. What a difference!!! Update Info: Monitor worked great for only eight months after purchase. Refused to power up.  Would not recommend Dell monitors to anyone. I am now giving it  a one star. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,Not the Xbox 360 power supply
1.0,This keyboard worked for about 2 weeks before breaking down couldn't even type worst purchase ever don't buy this
3.0,"Works, and fits in narrow or tight spots. Moves decent air for it's depth I guess, but it wasn't as strong as I expected for static pressure. Just kind of underwhelming. Quiet but not silent. One of the two I ordered has a slight grinding noise like there's microscopic gravel in the bearing, so I'll see how long it lasts.<br /><br />This fan is touted as being for cpu coolers and RADIATORS, but doesn't come with the required 3/4&#34; '6-32' screws with M4 flat washers that you will need for use on a radiator. You'll have to find these yourself at a hardware store. For a $20 fan, these should have been included.<br /><br />Will likely purchase Scythe next time for less money."
5.0,"I have to say, I don't know why I haven't purchased this sooner. Prior to me purchasing this, I used to stream video games using Steam from my desktop PC in one room to my laptop in another room using my WiFi connection (802.11n). It would work fine for me, but I would get the occasional lag/choppiness in my stream because of dropped packets. When I purchased this, I tested out the in-home streaming feature of steam and I must say, this thing works FLAWLESSLY. It's literally as if my laptop is hooked directly into my router. I can play my steam games with the in-home streaming settings set to maximum quality with no issues whatsoever. 5 out of 5 stars for me; you won't regret this purchase."
5.0,Fit's good and will keep my screen protected.
3.0,the right and left clicks sometimes not working properly when i play dota 2.
2.0,"Pros:  Built in Battery, battery life - unknown<br />Cons:  Range is barely 7 ft.<br /><br />Device claims to work up to 30 ft.  I bought this for my wife's classroom so she could leave her computer connected to the projector and stand at the board to teach without walking back and forth all day to click links and bring students' attention to certain parts of her lessons.  Would have been perfect if the range is what it claimed."
4.0,It's a charger. It charges. There you go.
1.0,i ordered this product because it said it was for my laptop that i own and it is not the right size for my laptop i have the hp notebook and thats what it says in the title and it does not fit the charger was way to big to fit in the hole and i am now late on my vlacs classes because i thought i ordered the correct charger but it is the wrong one
5.0,Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  Install it and forget about it.  I've never had a problem with it.
5.0,"Using it on a Canon 6D. No camplains at all. Really fast access. The adapter itself is not at same level, even though. Bad connection, had to use a previous adapter that I already had."
4.0,Goo
2.0,"If you want iTunes, don't get this!  It doesn't support iTunes. I sent it back"
1.0,at first battery worked well enough as i got 2 to 3 hours of use. after only a few months it only lasts 45 to 60 minutes. I only use it occasionally so it is disappointing.  i do not recommend it.
2.0,"Not sure if it's a driver problem or what, but this wireless NIC does not hold a connection worth squat."
4.0,It oorked
3.0,"The eyes don't light up. Not necessary, but I thought it would be cool and it did influence my decision to purchase this product. So I was disappointed, but the product works, so it is serving its purpose, unlike the other USB drive that I ordered from the same company."
4.0,I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Work Pro 12.2 Tablet. It woks so what else can you say?
3.0,It doesn't snap on all the way but it'll do
2.0,This product it really dangerous i believe cos it get`s too hot hot and may cause fire hazardous
5.0,"Works as describe.  If your going to use it in a phone I would suggest putting it into phone and letting your phone format it, this will save you a bunch of headaches later."
1.0,I bought 10 via a fundraiser for my classroom. 1 wss still in factory testing mode and useless. 1 emitted a buzzing noise when the power button was pressed and failed to boot. Another failed to come with the os. This really sucks.
1.0,"It worked well at first.  I purchased it so I didn't have to have a long cable between the USB plug in my car and the place where the phone is clearly supposed to sit.  However, this cable stopped working after only several months.  I can no longer play music or charge my phone.  There does not appear to be any damage, so the ends must not be fitted/soldered too well."
5.0,Works good
2.0,Not leather.
5.0,The color and feel were just what I expected! Love the magnetic type of snap too. I feel it protects my Kindle too!
4.0,"The perfect bag for my Dell 13&#34; 2-in-1.  Love the color (hot blue), the heavy fabric, and the fact that the bag is well padded.  Only suggestion to manufacturer: consider adding a removable shoulder strap."
5.0,Fits my camera perfectly and gets me about 2 hours of video at highest resolution! I love how easy it is to use and the capacity is perfect for my needs.
1.0,did not work with computer
4.0,takes a lot of desk space
5.0,Good and fast enough for a car camcorder to write a Full HD video. Used with HP F200 car camcorder.
3.0,"SD card & CF card ports work well. However, usb ports do not. Only reads my usb 3.0 hard drive & not my usb 2.0 hard drive. Not as advertised. Everything else works just fine."
2.0,Headphones broke within the first 5 minutes of use. The black mesh part came off and I was unable to put it back on. Overall disappointed.
4.0,"This card is doing its job in my S4. Lots of room for storing photos, music and videos. Good item."
4.0,So slim !
3.0,"I've had the item 12 months. I've always had minor problems. It just recently started freezing and rebooting my devices. 2 GS3's, currently S4. SanDisk is sending me a new one."
2.0,"Can you please email me @ samleo722@gmail.com because I need to send this back to you to replace the battery because the computer is not charging. I still want the laptop but something needs to be fixed because I can't use it unless it is on the charger, which is very inconvenient and displeasing. I was trying to give it a test period to see if it was just me but it is not. I wish you could email me asap to discuss how to fix this problem."
3.0,Home button not easy to push on in case.
5.0,Great product at a great price!
2.0,Too large for my macbook retina 15
3.0,ok
2.0,"The case is alright, but doesn't snap on completely and stay on like I would've liked."
1.0,Move on.  Look for something else.  Set up is a nightmare.  If you want to spend hours on the phone or chatline with customer service then buy this product.
5.0,Works perfectly!
4.0,"As advertised.  I was looking for a dust cover for my multipurpose printer, but there was not one available for my particular printer.  Went by manufacturers dimensions, selected a cover that would fit over the top by just tall enough to cover keypad.  This cover worked perfectly for my purposes.  Seems well made and I anticipate it lasting as long as my printer."
5.0,It has worked out to be a great purchase.
2.0,I was disappointed in the material and it did not contain the stylus.
3.0,The side of my headphone broken randomly and the thing is I did even press on it that hard. I was just picking them up to put on then out of no where crack. The side was broken. Has everything you want but breaks easily.
1.0,"I have purchased two of these 64gb sd cards and used them in an Android phone, and in a video recorder.After about 3 months usage in my phone, the card would randomly unmount and it took many remounts or reboots to get the card to work again.  Eventually, it stopped accepting writes at all, and couldn't even be formatted... although I could see what was on there.I repurchased the card, and after a couple months, the same thing happened again: random unmounts.  I moved the card to a video recorder, where it worked for a while... but even with a different usage pattern, it died again.I have had no problems with 32GB cards so far.  I'm staying away from this generation of 64GB cards.----EDIT----Getting these cards RMA'd was quick and easy.  I had a Lexar 128GB SD card die too, and I sent the cards in all at the same time.  I haven't gotten an update from Lexar, but I got updates AND my replacement from SanDisk.  Supposedly there was something fixed in this new card revision.  I hope so."
4.0,Perfect fit for my ipad air one. Dont think itll protect so much if it where to fall. And doeant stand as good either. But other then that good fit nice casa
5.0,What accolades can one say about an SD card that works and is an economical buy.  Put it in my GoPro camera and promptly filled it up.
3.0,Pro's:  This screen looks nice and has all the correct labels and such.  I used it on a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro model.  It fits and came in pristine condition.<br /><br />Con's:  The glue it came with DOES NOT hold!  I would recommend ordering an alternative glue at the same time.
1.0,Do not buy these cords. I bought 5. One broke immediate (prong separated from the cord). Three of them don't actually charge i phones or i pads and  one actually works.
4.0,Fits my samsung tab 4 really well. Color and design is beautiful. Very happy with my purchase.
1.0,I can't charge the keyboard because the cord doesn't fit.
5.0,"I'm  satisfied with this purchase.However I was very surprised to find the touch pad to be Android. I may have been mistaken  when I read the details of the touch pad, I thought it was Windows 7. But I'm not  unhappy with the pad. I have a couple other electronics that are  droids so this pad will help to better understand how androids work."
3.0,"Ya get whatcha pay for!<br /><br />Small speakers (good for a small desk), and small sound. Mind you, I've been used to HK's Sound Sticks III, but they died after many, many years. I'm a little &#34;spoiled,&#34; I guess.<br />;-)"
5.0,"It works, and puts 64GB in a chip smaller than my thumbnail.  The adapter also works and allows you to insert the micro card into your computer.  What is not to like?"
1.0,Non-wet application of the screen protector - just doesn't work.  The screen protector just didn't stick to the curved edges of the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Can't recommend this product.
3.0,bien
2.0,"Clip is not quite as pictured.  Instead of tapering down to the width of the chip, it is wide until almost the tip.  This means on the board i wanted to use it with, it hits another part next to the chip and can't be used.  I have a clip that is shaped like the one pictured on amazon and it works fine.<br />Looks like it should work fine but couldn't test it because it wouldn't fit.<br />Looses 1 star because it doesn't fit for my application.<br />Looses 2 stars because it's not the same as what is pictured."
2.0,Doesn't fit my Kindle Fire and returning it seems complicated.
3.0,Good quality
3.0,"Some of the parts were broken and out of place. But it wasn't something that it would be worth returning, nothing that's too noticeable but if you do look for it, you'll notice it."
2.0,"It is not fit, miss spec about 1mm for upper and lower cases that can scratch your Mac"
2.0,Not sticking at some edges.
5.0,Purchased these to use in Contour Roam cameras. Records quality videos and downloads fast.  Highly recommend these cards for your micro SD card devices.
3.0,"I've had this for a week now. First impressions are good. I've deleted a few apps as they have no interest to me. I upgraded to windows 10 straight away as I don't like windows 8 so I am still learning as my old laptop is windows 7. So far the only typing I have done is emails but already the most annoying feature about this laptop is that unless you hit it right in the middle, the space bar doesn't work. I am not a typist so I look at the keys while I am typing. I only typed one line but when I looked up there were 3 instances where the spacebar hadn't worked and words were joined together. This slows you down when you have to keep going back to put spaces in. Not sure what I can do about this and I know it's really going to annoy me. The jury's still out on whether I will get on with this laptop."
2.0,One of the inside pockets has a hole.
4.0,"Works much better than what I had before, so love it but could be better..."
3.0,It's the wrong one because I thought I was getting the 64 GB one.  I need to know  how to return this one and I will reorder the right one.
2.0,The distance between the VGA and audio jack is too short for the laptop I bought this for.
4.0,Replaced one that crapped out in my tablet - taking most of my apps and a few hours of my time with it.
3.0,"Really like the design, and the fact that it can be used both as backpack and shoulder bag. Neat.<br />The one main complaint is that the zipper for the large compartment broke (the slider got disconnected) after four days of normal use. That part of the bag seems under-dimensioned for the wear and tear it will go through. The zipper is 'incorporated' with the bag, which means there is no way to reattach the slider. As the main compartment opens sideways, this makes the bag useless as a backpack."
5.0,"I'm not a heavy user of data but enough that my pictures and music videos wouldn't fit on the factory 4 gig card. You can never have enough memory as it gets used up quick. It has the advertised memory capacity rating and has improved speed on my smartphone and tablet when moving pictures and videos to different folders. No lag compared to the cheap factory memory card. Buy the better card the first time, you won't be regretting it later. Would recommend and buy again"
2.0,Expected a more substantial fabric. Thought the bag would stand independently.
1.0,"After I put this card in my new S4, my camera would hang and just not respond to anything. Some apps also stopped working.  I put in my old 16GB card and everything worked fine."
1.0,If you are using OSX Mavericks you will be disappointed.  The problem is that this device does not work and causes the monitor hooked through it so disconnect or freeze.  It seems to be a software/ firmware issue and not resolved by either driver install they offer on their website.
5.0,"I bought it to have extra storage on my Samsung tablet. If anyone wonders in which direction you place it in the black side is on the back, while the red and gray side face the front screen. Aldo works great on my canon dslr with the adapter."
4.0,"Most problem-free card-reader I have ever used. Works plug-and-play on all my platforms, even with oddly-formatted SD stuff being plugged into it.<br />So, why'd I dock the star? It only reads from SD or microSD at once. Which means that if you want SD to work, nothing gets to be plugged into the microSD slot, and vice versa. But I can't complain much: it's trouble-free otherwise."
1.0,"Just plane crap.  I just received it and it turns itself off anytime I run, well ANYTHING.  I have heard for years that Acer is the worst computer out there, but I figured I'd try it myself, and yes they are.  The fact you can't run chrome to check e-mail while downloading dropbox is just plain stupid.  DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP YOU WILL REGRET IT."
4.0,good
2.0,"I ordered this on June 22, 2015.  I left my laptop unplugged for two days and the battery has already died and won't power up again.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this item again. Barely lasted two months."
1.0,It didnt work. It sucks
5.0,"At the time, this was one of the best you can get.  Even now, at UHS-1, you will be doing better than the older, slower chips.  The form factor is handy for products which can take the Micro SD."
3.0,"Pretty, but does not feel like genuine leather."
1.0,My iPhone 6 constantly complains about this not being an original accessory. This hasn't happened even with other cheap cables.
1.0,"Massive headache to get it working with Comcast and thanks to deceptive description and lack of features from amazon I may be left high and dry soon.<br />Not that Comcast's mydeviceinfo page makes it easy to see but this modem is technically now &#34;End of Life&#34; on their networks, which means it &#34;might&#34; lose connection entirely soon. Now the newer TM822G model is fully supported and is actually cheaper on Amazon right now but because Amazon doesn't tell you when an updated model is available (unlike certain other better tech sites that have something to do with eggs). Out of 30 day return window so hopefully this works long enough to make the savings off the cable bill worth it."
4.0,Looks very good on my mac
5.0,"I'm using this SD card in my Samsung Galaxy S3 instead of another one I bought with the same manufacture ""SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP"" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007KFXIDE/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).It's working perfectly since October 2012."
5.0,My charger for my laptop is working wonderful.
2.0,Good case. Broke about 2 weeks into use but up until then
5.0,"the site is very reasonably priced unit memory added to my Samsung galaxy no pro-12.2, 64 GB. It also helped expand the memory in this to allow for better storage of songs, information, and I believe it to be a good value."
5.0,"Works well, and fast, does everything it claims to do.  These sshd items are the best.  You cannot hurt them, and they last forever."
4.0,good product
3.0,It was just as the one in the pic. I love the color I just wish fit a little bit tier from the bottom part other than that it's a good product
3.0,"This is a study in &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;<br /><br />I bought this tablet for my office, as an experiment more or less: I wanted to see if it could replace some of our paperwork with Google Forms, and to see if patients would tolerate (or better yet learn something from) a few minutes of educational video each visit. While I had my clinic wired to accept multiple TVs, I never got around to it, and technology has caught up so that portable DVD players are no longer needed.<br /><br />WHERE CORNERS WERE CUT<br />Aesthetics - It's kinda heavy, which doesn't bother me, but the buttons are all on one end and not intuitive<br />Form - I can only see that one particular cover fits it completely, and it has mixed reviews.<br />Camera - It's horrible. That's all I can say about it. Just horrible.<br />OS - Their version of Android leaves out what are normally standard features. For example, I was shocked to find that there is no way to set up user accounts. I had planned on setting the tablet up as the administrator/owner, and creating a &#34;Guest&#34; or &#34;Patient&#34; account with limited access. That way I could leave it with someone for 15 minutes, and trust that person would not (accidentally or otherwise) end up on inappropriate websites, in the middle of my email, or on our clinic server. My choices are to root it, or to get a child protection app. It also (as far as I can tell so far) as no automatic setting for screen brightness. Given these two big omissions in their build of the OS, I'm assuming that there are going to be other things missing that I will find over the next couple of weeks. There were default settings which were out of the norm, like having the microphone (for speech dictation) not set to appear in the keyboard by default. I had to search around the internet to find out how to get it put back where it has been on every other Android device I've ever used.<br /><br />WHERE IT PERFORMS ACCEPTABLY<br />Screen - For my uses and for theprice, it was acceptable.<br />Speed - It handles large picture files, movies (on the device and streaming) and all the apps I use perfectly well and smoothly.<br />Overall build - Seems good so far. The touch screen works and is just sensitive enough. I don't think it has the &#34;hover&#34; capability like my phone does though.<br /><br />After installation of &#34;Kids Place&#34; and an app to allow full screen pictures, I think that it will do what I needed it to do. If not, it will be my toy for Facebook, light email, light reading, and quick searches while hanging out around the house. I wanted something this size, and there's nothing that's even close to it in price."
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this card.  I usually don't have an issue with SanDisk, but this 32GB ultra card died after two months.  Died as in, no longer recognizable by PC / Camera or any device.  Now I have to wrestle with warranty claim."
4.0,"Love my keyboard protector. Took getting used to as silicone feels a little bit sticky compared to the name keyboard. But I like the protection is gives as I tend to be a bit messy and eat around my computer. My only gripe is that the keys on the top left slightly don't align to my Apple 13&#34; retina, so at night, it has a double outline, competing with the bottom light, but you can turn off the keyboard light and it should be fine."
2.0,"It worked great for about a month, then my laptop said that I had to service it. So I was like what the damn!? Doesn't make sense."
5.0,I bought this for my new Gopro3 black. It works wonderfully! I totally recommend it if you're looking for some high quality and speed
2.0,"Be careful when ordering. Apple changed this laptop but didn't change the model number. I have the A1278 early 2011, and this battery is for A1278  2008 .... and now it's too late to return it. Good job, Apple."
1.0,DOA.
2.0,The bottom portion of the case fits very well and snaps into place.  The keyboard cover is alright but it blocks all the backlight from the keyboard since the letters on the keys are black and not clear like the keyboard cover that I had in the past.  The top cover that should snap on tightly like the bottom cover just will not snap into place and keeps coming off.  I'm worried if I were ever to accidentally drop my MacBook it would fall of and not offer any protection whatsoever.  I'm not sure if the issue is just a defect in what was shipped to me or if this is the quality of this product.  For the $12 it's not worth my effort to return the product at my cost.  Disappointing
1.0,Fits fine but the handles are flop not handles at all and it costs more to send back than you pay for it I found out the hard way I paid 8.98 to send it back dumb I know but I didn't look to see the cost before  printing out the label.  Anyway the tablet it's for is junk too so I sent the tablet back too
5.0,"It's memory. It works in my phone. I can store files to it. The price was right. If you're looking for 32G, this will do just fine."
3.0,"This sort of works, but every time I turn on my computer the mouse and keyboard are on opposite &#34;channels.&#34; I have to unplug the keyboard and plug it back in to get it to work on the same channel that the mouse is on."
4.0,"Didn't trust at first because of the looks and reviews containing only a few words. Well there's not much to say. It works like a charm. Sometimes the brick heats up too much, but OEM charger does that too, just not as much and not as quickly."
4.0,"The size of the mouse pad is great, as it lets my hand move around quite a bit without the mouse losing contact with the pad.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after several months of use, the fabric on the top of the mousepad (where my wrist sits) slowly starts to degrade. Because the mousepad is black, the fading is very obvious. I haven't been able to find a fix for it yet.<br /><br />That being said, I will probably purchase another one of these."
4.0,It was overall good i would give it 5 stars if it wasnt too glossy its like a fingerprint magnet
1.0,"The CD rum door don't open , I purchase this item back in April 2015 I just start using it now and found out the hard way that is defective and that my 30 day return policy with amazon is no longer valid."
1.0,"The memory sticks seem to be defective, causing my computer to go dark and stop functioning. I reinstalled the original 2gb sticks that came with the computer, and the computer worked fine. I tried this twice, with the same result each time."
1.0,Plays music but will not play movie on Windows 8.1 laptop.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,Did not know it did not fit into the camera. Return for refund.
5.0,I bought this for my Galaxy S4.  You need to reformat it to Fat32 32kb cluster size to fully take advantage of it in the phone but once you do it works great.  I copied everything from my iPod (about 40GB) to it and now I can stop carrying 2 devices around.
2.0,"The only good thing about this product is that it keeps my keyboard free of dust and possible crumbs. I've only had it a few months and the gold color is already fading on certain keys. Some of the letters are also off centered, but I wasn't too upset about that seeing that this was only a few dollars. The paint used to color the cover also rubs off on the frame of my screen when I close my laptop (I have the Air so the screen frame is silver instead of black like on the Pro.) and it's kind of hard to wipe off."
2.0,"It arrived missing the screen protectors and keyboard cover. It fits alright, but does not clip into place.<br />Not the best case."
3.0,Thank you. It works fine.
4.0,"Great MicroSD, fast and holds a ton of memory.  If you really need one buy it and you won't be disappointed."
5.0,This was my first time adding an SD card to a Smart Phone. I just got a Nokia Lumia 1520 and with such an excellent screen I wanted to be able to play movies on it for trips or to watch at my desk while working.So far I have put 6 albums and 6 Hi Def movieson the card and still have 20gb to spare. Everything loads up just as fast as if it was stored on the phone's internal memory.Very happy with this little guy.
5.0,When you are looking for a high end SD card with great write speeds look no further than Scan Disk Ultra
2.0,"Super flimsy, but haven't tried it yet."
3.0,Worked great until it stopped..
5.0,"Works great in my BlackBerry Z10. Holds all I need and it is fast. I really wish there was more to say, but I can't think of Anything. No cons."
4.0,The SanDisk Ultras tend to work reliably on all my different cameras and phones which is not always true of some common but less expensive cards. This simplifies ordering but they do cost a bit more.
5.0,What more can I say?I'm using it to double the memory of my Asus TF700 (from 32 to 64Gb) and this card has a good read/write performance and it's SanDisk!Recommended.
1.0,Horrible screen quality.  Doesn't work well with PC.  Can't even use as a 2nd monitor due to weird screen reflection.
4.0,"The little plate for the camera, and the home button were not included. My oversight. The tools were a nice bonus and the screen works well. The screen had some flex to it and allows for the home button to be pressed without actually pressing the home button. Over all the repair process went well."
3.0,"The case I received is NOT the one shown when I placed my order. Lovely to look at and will undoubtedly do well to protect my brand new toy, but as a stand it is useless. It holds my Kindle in landscape but the screen's contents will not re-orient 180 degrees so using it in its correct stand configuration doesn't work and it does not function as a stand in portrait unless folded back with tab folded under (easy to holds, however) and then  placed in another stand. How disappointing!"
5.0,What can I say. It works very well and the price is less. What more can I ask for in a great product.
5.0,"I brought this for my new phone, the note 3. For me when it comes to any kinds of cards for camera, phones or any device that uses cards I trust SanDisk. I have them in my DSLR, my Go Pro Camera. I'm a professional photographer and I have never had a problem with scan disk cards. So whenever I'm in need of a SD Card, Or Micro SDXC this is the brand I go with."
1.0,"I purhcased this card for my Hero 3 cam.  It worked all of last year, or the 3-4 times i used it.  I used it again this year and had some great once in a  life time ski videos and the card failed.  It could not be read or reformatted.  I lost all my vids.  It was strictly used in my hero 3 cam.  I pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several PC's, multiple card readers, and recovery software but no good. I have never known a card to fail and I am extremely disappointed.Try another brand.  Next time I will use multiple cards with smaller storage and a different brand."
1.0,It is too thick to provide a clear screen
4.0,I like everything but the ads. Cant make them  go away
3.0,"This card advertises itself as UHS1 but it's actually UHS50.This means that it will not go up to SDR104 speeds/throughput.Not necessary bad, just false advertising."
4.0,Good deal. Had to push a little on the patch ends to make connectivity but besides that they work just fine.
4.0,"A standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory.  Grated, if you have an older android phone, or older tablet, you probably won't see much difference.  But if you have a modern device like a galaxy s4, or note 3, or equivalent mobile device, you'll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device.  For modern phones, a UHS-1 memory card is a must.  The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because it's not a sandisk extreme, or a sandisk extreme pro.  But then again, you must have EXTREMELY specific needs to want to get 85MB/s transfer speeds on a mobile device.  For movies, music and apps, this one is more that adequate."
2.0,This charger lasted me a couple months before the cord broke and it stopped working.
3.0,"Works great, even better then a more expensive mouse, however the mouse wheels seems to squeak more and more as I use it."
2.0,"Decent product for the price but leaves much to be desired.  To accommodate the size, not only are the keys smaller, but the ratio of where keys are in relation to each other is modified which makes it very difficult to touch type and adds a decent learning curve for somebody who is used to a normal key layout.  The mouse pad does not support dragging at all, which makes certain activities very difficult or impossible. Often while typing, pressing a key will double insert whatever character has been hit.  This fact is simply irritating and time consuming when typing normally, but entering passwords, especially into a Linux terminal, becomes a nightmare.  If you need a very small keyboard that kind of works and is inexpensive, this does the job, but not well."
5.0,No problems at all.
5.0,No complaints about this card. It's much faster than what came with my Android devices and of course the capacity is nice. I have not experienced any issues indicating any defect.
1.0,I  purchased this to replace one that is about 6 years old.  It didn't last a week.  My new computer was having problems and finally wouldn't connect at all. Other computer in the house also wouldn't connect to the internet.  Reinstalled the old router and everything works great.  The first 3 or 4 days everything worked.  I do not recommend this router.
5.0,Cables were perfect match and delivered on time with no issues.
5.0,Impressive speed and uptime
1.0,"The Kindle cannot survive a little fall, I've had it for about a month before it cracked. And a Crack isn't covered under the warranty"
5.0,Has been working great....
4.0,"Great led, kinda too bright when reading."
1.0,Got these 10 days ago. Love the length for the car and for the outlets that are too far away. BUT I regularly get &#34;this device is not supported&#34; and cable shorts out if touched wrong. Within a month 2 of them are already busted. I am pulling out the 3rd one (shortest one) and expect it will also be broken in a week or two. I would NOT recommend this product.
2.0,"My daughter was not pleased, so I don't known<br /><br /> what she will do with it."
5.0,"FAST data transfer! This is the standard, the measuring stick for a great 32 GB micro SD card- you will not regret getting the brand name instead of getting the cheapos."
3.0,It does not have the battery life as advertised. Also the touch pad is awful.
2.0,GOOD.
4.0,good
3.0,"This router is OK, but that's about it.<br /><br />It's an inexpensive router that you can use to run wireless (or wired) devices through that's super cheap. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. The range being the major issue. Great for single room applications or small apartments, but not great for multi-floor or large homes with lots of walls to go through.<br /><br />Installation:<br />==========<br />It's pretty easy to get it up & running. I tested it in tandem with a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and a Motorola Surfboard (two separate locations). Plug an ethernet cord into your modem or router you're connecting this to, kick on the power & wait for the lights to light up.<br /><br />You can access the software via a wired connection or by connecting to it wirelessly. Default SSID is JCG xxxxxx. The default login & password are located on a sticker on the bottom. Once signed in, open your browser to 192.168.1.1<br />NOTE: Do this BEFORE you connect it to a modem or a separate router. Particularly if you're using it with another router. Otherwise the other router will assign it a different IP and you won't be able to connect.<br /><br />Once in, you can set the router up as a standard router, repeater, hot spot, or a couple other options.<br />I set mine up as a router.  While you're in the software, you can change your SSID to whatever you want it to be (FBI Van is always popular!) and can change the wireless login and password as well.<br /><br />Connecting once set up:<br />==================<br />Once set up, reboot it (usually does that when you apply the settings anyway), scan your wireless network for the router, and attach to it.<br />Here's the problem I ran into. If you're not within a couple feet of this thing it DOES NOT like to always connect.<br />iPhone 6 = Had a devil of a time connecting. It saw it, I put in the login credentials but it kept saying the password was bad. Walked up to the router w/ the phone in my hand and it connected. What the heck?<br />LG G3 = Fairly easy time connecting<br />Moto X (1st Gen) = Pretty easy time connecting<br />Moto G (1st Gen) = Fairly easy connecting<br />MacBook Pro 2013 = sometimes it'd connect, sometimes it wouldn't<br /><br />But then, get too far away from the router (say maybe 15 to 20 feet) and it'll randomly drop the signal.<br />I used a Wi-fi Analyzer on my LG G3 and found this to be the case. Over and over the router would drop it's signal and then come back.<br />All the while the other router in the building still had a solid signal (especially the Netgear Nighthawk--that thing rocks!)<br /><br />What was strange was that it seemed to go in waves too. And before you crucify me about channels, the other routers in the room I tested it with were both using separate channels far away from the channel this broadcasted on (Netgear broadcasts on 3, this was on 8. Motorola was on 4, this was on 8), so it wasn't channel interference. It legitimately would just &#34;drop&#34; it's signal and then come back.<br /><br />I even tested the router without it being attached to another router too. Yep. Same thing. It usually happened though when you were a good 15 to 20 feet away from it through a wall.<br /><br />However, when it was working, I could get a good signal from it a good 40 to 50 feet away...but again, then it would drop at random and you're now without a connection. Tried rebooting a few times, etc. But to no avail. Even tried repositioning it.<br /><br />Size:<br />====<br />It's quite a bit smaller than my Netgear Nighthawk (see pictures), but the Nighthawk is a beast! So size wise, the JCG has a much smaller footprint. The three antennae's on the back are pretty easy to adjust too.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />===============<br />If you need a super basic router and you're in a tight space (say a smaller apartment) or if you're going to use it in the same room, this is probably a great little bargain of a router. But if you need something that'll broadcast further (say down the hall and into the living room) and stay on consistently, I can't really recommend it for that. The signal just dropped too often for me to feel comfortable using it as my primary router.<br /><br />When it was on, it was pretty nice. Good, solid speedtest numbers, nice features, but it doesn't seem to like to broadcast very far away from itself and stay on consistently.<br /><br />* I purchased this router at a significant discount in return for a review *ast further (say down the hall and into the living room) and stay on consistently, I can't really recommend it for that.

1.0,These do not work 99% of the time
4.0,"Works Well, use it often. No problems."
5.0,"I bought this memory card for my Galaxy Note 8. It's a SanDisk and worked great. The card was recognized quickly and I put all my music, videos and other files on it to save room for my internal memory. The price was also very good."
4.0,"I bought this card because I hope to transition from a PC to a smartphone in the near future. For now I use an adapter to run it on the PC. The write times aren't as good as I had hoped, but they're acceptable overall. Plenty of storage space for my files, some of my music, pics, that sort of thing. Have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part. Overall, a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks done.Sidenote: the card came formatted with exFAT by default. The onyl way I could downgrade to FAT32 was to use a third party app. For some reason, the card can't be read by my phone, but the phone is an older model Samsung, so that could be the issue."
4.0,Does it come with a cover?
3.0,I like it. Thanks
2.0,"Stopped charging up 2 months after I got it. I like the product - but I can't get anyone to take ownership over an internal hardware issue.  So, instead of 5 stars, only 2. Citimall_TAX FREE免税 Storefront, I'm looking at YOU!"
5.0,"I have two of these that I am using with a GoPro HERO3 and they work great (I will be getting more!).  While I could do the 64GB, I (so far) am preferring the 32GB, because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it's life so I can swap a card and battery at the same time and save opening/closing the case and swapping parts all of the time.  The card is plenty fast, never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as I have a 3rd card that I have been using in multiple mobile phones (HTC and BB) since 2010 and have never had any problem at all with any of them."
3.0,"I've been using this keyboard for about a week, and overall, I like it just fine. The case fits my iPad Air 2 perfectly, and closes snugly. Seems to hold a charge well, and the swivel works smoothly in both the horizontal and vertical positions. The viewing angle works for me too. One thing I have learned - the cover only closes properly if the horizontal orientation is such that the home button is on the right. Although you can position it to be on the left, the case won't close properly that way.<br /><br />It is MUCH less expensive than similar keyboard/cases, and I assume that the materials used are why. My &#34;a&#34; key has gotten stuck a couple of times, and I think it is because of the plastic used. But -- so far so good. Comes with a 6 month warranty and a mini USB charger."
2.0,"Worked for about 2-3 charges then stopped, and one even came apart without with exposed wires.  Wouldn't purchase again."
1.0,I should have listened to the other reviews especially the ones that said about system crash or very slow. My wife started a online degree program and 1 day into using her new laptop it crashes blue screen and windows will not start great sending it back with only a few hours of use into it I'm glad she didn't save anything on this. I would recommend to buy a different laptop this one has problems.
5.0,"Man, this 128 (122gb actually) is amazing!  I had a 64gb card and been transferring my apps to the external card and ran out of memory.  With this bad boy, I can move anything I want, load it with tons of music and still have tons of space.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Look how many highly positive reviews this card has; just get this one. It is huge, it is fast and reasonably priced for a such a high-speed chip.BTW, this comes with the filesystem formatted to exFAT.  Depending on your device, it may not like that and you need to format it to FAT32.  The problem is that Windows does not support formatting FAT32 filesystems above 32GB.  So you can format this as FAT32 under Linux or use this tool in Windows [...]"
1.0,"If I could give it less than one star I would.  Constantly crashes anytime an application needs video power (heavier load).  Crashes in Photoshop, crashes playing games, sometimes crashes in plain Windows.  Type &#34;970 gtx crash&#34; and get 540,000 results.  And yes I updated chipset, BIOS, motherboard, Windows, Video Card drivers... I basically paid $340 for a video card that is less capable than a $50 one."
1.0,Black Screen... see other reviews for details. Seems to be a common problem. I am very dissatisfied with this laptop.
5.0,"Great quality for the price, an overall great microphone"
5.0,"Purchased this as a memory addition for the Surface. Great way to add all files for a meeting, so the laptop can stay behind. This card is fast enough so you can access files quick. Great Product."
1.0,"I was almost fooled. it took me 3 hours to write 97GB of vidoes to this card and everything looked fine until i started testing the videos.After deleting and re writing some videos i came to conclusion that only about 40 GB of the data was readable,the rest was unreadable files. i am not sure if this thing has even 64 GB capacity."
2.0,"SOmetimes it didn't work at all. It would send static and flashing pictures. When it did work, it did not allow me to fill the screen with my work. It would always bleed. No matter what resolution I set it on, it was always hanging off the edge of the screen. I bought another one which had the same problem, so maybe it is the nature of the beast, but I still wish someone would have told me about it before I bought it."
5.0,-Great storage-Low price-Good transfer rate-Respond and read time is good-almost 14.8 will be available for user usage
2.0,"Sorry Folks!  Way too big, bulky, and hot to wear.  Good sound, though."
3.0,"a little snug, but I do believe my Sony Vaio Flip 13.3 is slightly wider than the average 13.3 laptop. Despite my title, I did not wash it, nor would I. I just thought it would be run to rip on the Sleeve aspect."
3.0,"After several months of CONSTANT resetting, I finally gave up.  I just simply could not waste another couple of hours resetting every week.  It works great when it does."
4.0,It is exactly what i was looking for. Thanks
3.0,Tcolors are fairly washed out and it's very difficult to get the right angle for viewing the screen correctly- it's very one-dimensional in that you can only see it clearly from a very specific angle.
2.0,"Thus microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed &#34;twice&#34;. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn't &#34;see&#34; that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don't plan to try formatting it again, I'll switch to a different brand of card."
3.0,"1. starts up as soon as it plugs in to the computer<br />2. it really does click more quietly<br />3. nice feel, wheel works really well<br />4. it's been a month, and i have yet to change the battery<br /><br />its a little annoying that it goes on sleep, because i keep forgetting about that. but hey. it did say that in the description.<br /><br />edit: 1-16-2015<br />i'm sorry, i had to bump it down to 3 stars, because IT WONT SCROLL. when i try to scroll, the page jumps up and down and it drives me crazy."
2.0,So i thought i bought the battery a year ago. Turns out i bought it 8 months ago and its dead already not conpletely it still lasts 45 minutes under regular use but not enough to get me through class.
3.0,"We connected this to a 2.0 USB port when my fiancee's ethernet port stopped working after the upgrade to Windows 10.  I am pleased to report that this adapter fixed problem, and does work on Windows 10 with included drivers!  The speeds are comparable to what they were before, but for one reason or another (perhaps using a USB 2.0 port instead of 3.0?) we have occasional unresponsiveness when loading webpages in Chrome.  Web pages occassionally refuse to load without clicking refresh, but downloads seem consistent and online gaming seems to work fluently.<br /><br />Overall, it is a steady connection with some occasional web browsing slowdown.  It is Windows 10 compatible, and with the exception of when it slowly/doesn't load web pages, it works fine.  Not the most consistent device with a 2.0 port, but with 3.0 it may perform much better.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for honest feedback!"
2.0,Quality is lacking and it wears out quickly.
3.0,Part that plugs into phone stopped working after about a month on both that I bought
5.0,"I put it in my new Roku 2 XS and it seemed to work - that is, it recognized and formatted it. I'm hoping to use my Roku for music and video. I suppose that mostly I'll be streaming but I thought I'd give myself the option of locally storing some of the media."
3.0,"This item was great-- my daughter opened it at her birthday dinner and was able to use it immediately!  It arrived already charged.  Very nice!  But I got this with the understanding that there would be a 2-year warrantee that comes.  She is 8 and I'm worried it will break at some point.  I understand the warrantee is very good, but I don't se any indication that I actually got the warrantee.  The description when I placed it in the cart said that the warrantee was in the bundle-- with the cover-- but now all I see is the kindle and the cover.  Do I have the warrantee?  If there is a problem, whom do I contact?"
2.0,"I pre-ordered this item from Matias's website not from this seller, so my review goes entirely to the product itself.<br /><br />I like the general idea of being both ergo and mechanical. This keeps my wrists much more comfortable. I will be more than happy to see more such products coming up.<br /><br />However, this quality of this product is below the average of mechanical keyboards:<br />1. the switches are not as comfortable as Cherry's. It's quieter, but doesn't give your fingers enough rebounce.<br />2. more seriously, some hardware bugs make keys repeat themselves sometimes. For example, for my keyboard, pressing the &#34;c&#34; key once results in two &#34;c&#34;s on the screen. This happens roughly 1 out of 20 strokes! This is really intolerable. Also, some keys occasionally repeat itself until you press another key. This happens less often than the issue with &#34;c&#34;, but still very annoying. The end result is that my typing speed is reduced because I have to frequently go back to change what my keyboard has messed up."
1.0,We have two kindle fires. The 7 and the 6. They will not connect to my WiFi and if I finally get them to connect it only lasts for a few minutes. I have tried everything to fix but nothing works. I will never buy another kindle fire... Amazon doesn't offer any help to fix the problem.
2.0,"Finally arrived after two long weeks of me being headsetless.<br />After they arrived i had quite high expectations, the box was good, i heard good reviews about how comfortable they were, and how good they sounded.<br />PROS:They sent me the MSI gaming series version(not sure if it was a mistake or if everyone gets it)<br />and they look pretty<br />CONS:They are quite UNCOMFORTABLE, they are over ears, but do not fully cover, as parts of it do not touch skin, and the headband takes quite some getting use to, as normally i would put on a headset, then adjust instead of just putting it on and leaving it as is.<br />The SOUND QUALITY ISN'T that GREAT either, I've bought a few 5$ earbuds that sound better than these do.<br />So far I have only used this to watch anime, and youtube videos<br /><br />PS:Haven't used it for a game yet<br />Also havent used the mic yet.<br /><br />TLDR:Not that comfortable, doesnt sound too great for videos, disappointed, rather get Logitech g230's"
2.0,Broke the day I got it I was charging my batteries  and it was a very tight fit to the controller and it just fell apart
3.0,Seems cheap and flimsy
1.0,Did not function properly for me. Instructions that came with product were minimal and useless.
4.0,"With this card I picked up for $35 amazon's black friday sale, I increased my GNII's storage to 80GB! It transfers data at about 15MB read/write, which is well below advertised. However, this is very similar to the speed that my GNII's built in storage transfers data at, so when running large applications off of this SD card I see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself."
1.0,"I'm returning this piece of crap. Promises 150 mbps, delivers 10-12... Frustrating. Back it goes"
1.0,"I bought two of these a year ago and they still work great, ordered 3 more in April and the quality is different and 2 of the 3 no longer work.  The iPhone says accessoryis not supported."
1.0,Stopped working after a month.
3.0,"if you have a MSI or ASUS AMD AM3+ board and use all four RAM slots it doesn't quite fit. it hits against the RAM in slot 4 and and bends it in a little when ther fan is tightened down. you can only orient the fan in two directions and it didn't fit in either direction....it would have worked if i took out the RAM chip in slot 4...too bad,  looked cool and was pretty easy to install...keeping it for maybe another project"
3.0,Cord wears out a little in a couple of months but otherwise its great for the price
3.0,It takes a while to charge and is a bit temporamental when trying to use it while charging. Very accurate when fully charged. Wish the slot for the tablet to stand was more sturdy.
2.0,Had them hooked to a satellite radio. They worked well for that purpose but I managed to blow the woofer out already.  Speakers without it are pointless.
4.0,"This WAS the best keyboard I've ever owned (read update below)... I have no issues whatsoever with the Space Bar key, as others have... Just press the key towards the middle, not on the edges (there's no actuator there)... The keys are very quiet, and I love the low profile of the keyboard... The texture is absolutely amazing; I love the smooth, rubberized finish... Note that the red strip on the bottom has a plastic cover when shipped. You need to remove that for it to look right. Adjusting the Speed of the breathing affect could be a little more precise; it seems there's a big jump between the medium and medium-high settings... but anyway, I seriously love this keyboard. I would just say to be careful with the risers on the back. I accidentally broke one of mine when picking my keyboard up; even though I barely touched it. I would say the two flip-out risers on the back are the worst part of the keyboard, but that's an easy MacGuyver fix.<br />-------------------------<br />EDIT:<br />Its been almost a year, and I now use this keyboard at work, as I love how quiet the keys are. I work for a tech support company where I type all day, every day.<br /><br />The second riser in the back broke about a week after the first one did. I was still using it, while I would put a sticky notepad under the other side, so that it was even, but it didn't matter. The quality of the riser is just crap, and they should be ashamed for putting something like that on a keyboard like this. It really brought down the value and over quality.<br /><br />The lighting effects are still very good, and none of the keys show any sign of degradation. Little bits of dust and crumbs, etc, will get stuck in the bezel around the dragon emblem. Due to the very low resistance/feedback of the keys, I found myself making quite a bit of typing mistakes, as sometimes one or two keys just wouldn't register while I was typing. Honestly, this was not the best gaming keyboard, as it really doesn't seem to have all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time.all that many gaming features.<br /><br />I have since bought this keyboard for gaming ([[ASIN:B01DD2SMKQ Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers]]) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time."
5.0,"This mouse works just as advertised. Very quiet, no hassle, plug and play. I like the small USB adapter ."
4.0,"I really love this device! I love that I can access my amazon account on the kindle to view my wish list and also purchase books right from my device. My only complaint is sometimes when I turn a page or am browsing through amazon for a new book, the previous screen is &#34;burned in&#34; to where I have to reload the page again. Other than that this is a great product and I am very happy with my purchase."
3.0,Made signal slightly stronger
4.0,First set had a bad stick of ram.  The return was easy and the second set works perfectly.  Can't beat it for the price!
2.0,It will not scroll up or down
1.0,"So, it didn't seem to work with the Surface Pro 3 as advertised.  I made sure to isolate the variables, and everything works great without the hub.<br /><br />Oh, it does come with a dp mini to dp adapter, which works great!  It also shipped quickly.<br /><br />So my first instinct was to look through the documentation and make sure I set it up correctly.  I verified that, despite very minimal documentation, even online.  My next instinct was to call a support number - there was none.  Email address?  None listed.  On the website there's a web forum you can sign up on to request support.  This forum has requests for help that usually get responses after a couple days.  It doesn't seem very customer friendly, and my device doesn't work.  There were a few different people who had issues about spotty experiences using the Surface Pro 3 and the Club3d hub.<br /><br />I'll be using a usb3-to-displayport adapter to meet my needs.<br /><br />Needless to say, as it does not seem to work as advertised, and support is minimal, I will be returning it."
3.0,"Well, it works, but it is very picky about how the ethernet cable is set in it, if it gets bumped even a little, it will disconnect."
2.0,"I got this as a gift.  Loved it....until the on off switch broke....don't know why.  No unusual wear and tear.  It will work, but can't travel because it loses charge if the switch moves to on.  Went to order another....but for 100 dollars?  Don't think so."
1.0,"It did not charge after one week usage.  I's too busy to send back, 30 days return is expired.  I'm totally regret to purchase it base on all good reviews😞😞😞"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:918ddd6f6d6f2c098f1a9120dc5f0d69]]I was impressed with the Innogie® 10400mAh AlienPower Portable Charger due to the futuristic styling and battery efficiency. Does the Innogie 6000mah Passion Dual charger has the same qualities? See below to get the answer.<br /><br />Construction- The battery pack is made of brushed aluminium and it looks great. I like the fact that manufacturers are now moving to aluminium (like apple) and it is 100 times better than the cheap plastic looking devices we used to get. But even though the finish is good, the build is not perfect. the battery i got had rough edges and there were some gaps in construction. But still i will give the construction a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Battery Backup- Now we are all buying this battery for the battery backup it provides. 6000mah means it should charge a iphone 6 plus at least 1.5 - 2 times. But in real world testing, the battery died after charging my iphone 6 plus from 0% to 66%. I was expecting at-least one full charge for my phone. So from a battery backup perspective i will give this product a 1 out of 5, as it doesnt deliver 6000mah. (maybe my product was defective, but while going through all the reviews in amazon i found that no-one is getting the rated 6000mah battery backup)<br /><br />And my biggest gripe other than the lack of adequate battery backup is the way Innogie tried to use a single battery to display the amount of charge left. I am still trying to figure out how this is supposed to work. The manual says it will have 3 led's but i see only one. So maybe my battery is defective. Because of this i will give the battery a 2 out of 5 rating<br /><br />Video Review on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndRTq2nvEBw"
3.0,"fits a little bit snug, the cable can't fit inside it comfortably"
2.0,"Modem works fine but it does not support 300 down.  Stars are reflective of description claims.  If you don't have TWC Maxx in your area, this is a good modem.<br /><br />Maybe in some theoretical world but with TWC Maxx, extreme, I see 118 down and 11 up.  Was told I had to upgrade to the SB6183 version to get the 200 or 300 down speeds.  Must have 16 channels."
4.0,"I bought this stick as a replacement for my aging Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro and it fills the job wonderfully.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Insanely accurate X and Y axes, no physical deadzone on either, yet the stick perfectly centers itself every time.<br />-Grip is comfortable, if a bit large<br />-Can use TARGET software for programming and axis adjustment<br />-Stick does not accidentally twist much at all<br />-Ambidextrous<br /><br />Cons:<br />-All of the buttons are dome switches like on a gamepad, leading them to feel a little cheap.<br />-The trigger has a good deal of looseness to it and the tactile feedback is less than satisfying.<br />-The twist axis is not nearly as accurate as the X and Y, and mine has a small deadzone to it.<br />-The throttle movement is barely one inch, reducing its usefulness.<br />-It has 16 buttons, yet only 4 and the hat switch are on the stick itself.<br />-The LED lit base is very bright and somewhat distracting and there is no way to turn it off short of voiding your warranty and cutting a wire inside the stick.  You do get used to it after a while though.<br />-TARGET software is almost as complicated as it is powerful.<br /><br />And all of those cons are only worth taking one star away.  This is by far the most accurate stick I have ever used, even beating out my old Sidewinder 3D Pro from back when it was brand new.  The fact that it uses hall sensors instead of cheap potentiometers like the Logitech 3D Pro and all of Saitek/MadCatz budget joysticks means this stick should last an extremely long time compared to other sticks in the budget range.<br /><br />If you are looking for a stick, budget or performance, I would highly recommend this."
2.0,Not a tight alignment. Arcs prior to full engagement.
1.0,"Difficult to use.  Not very protective fell from seat while getting out of the car and my kindle was destroyed, lens shattered.  My original origami case from Amazon is much easier to use and the protection is much better I will not purchase another roo case."
4.0,So far is working like a charm.  Would have liked the option of a permanent Microsoft Office.  It took over 6 hrs. Working with a Microsoft Tech to download the software and trouble shoot the installation.  That's the reason for the 4 star.
1.0,Received damaged LCD
4.0,"I have used this adapter for a few weeks now, with my ThinkPad X220. It appears well built, and is functioning perfectly, without generating much heat, and without causing any audio interference. Yes, it is lighter than the original Lenovo charger, but I have an expensive compact charger that is lighter yet, and it has worked fine for years, so I don't see that as a negative. This is certainly a better choice and better value than the many counterfeit Lenovo chargers offered online, even here on Amazon."
2.0,"Crappy plastic sound.  If you want good sound at all, I'd say this is not for you.  I'd rather not listen to music than hear this weak, poorly balanced sound.  Sending them back."
3.0,"Cool art, but the quality in person is a lot less than what i expected."
5.0,"It's an SD Card that works great.  Big storage, and writes fast enough for me.  Not much to complain about."
4.0,"I never knew how dependent I was on my kindle until I couldn't charge it anymore!  The new cable worked!  However, I wish it was a faster charging cable like the original one that comes with the kindle.  I'm still happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"Lightweight, easy to hold, & easy to put kindle in & take out"
5.0,WE use these in our phones to carry our favorite tunes or take lots of pictures.  They are excellent quality.
2.0,"It works, but is extremely annoying if you're used to an Apple mouse. The first day it arrived, I threw it in the &#34;computer crap&#34; drawer and ordered a new Apple mouse."
5.0,"Heard that the card's write speed is insufficient, however I have used it extensively and haven't had a single problem with it!!"
1.0,"It doesn't work.  The claim that it doesn't need to be powered or active is a lie, because of voltage differences between the two standards.<br /><br />I tried using it with a brand new HP PS/2 keyboard (that I also ordered off of Amazon) and it did not work with it.  That same keyboard works fine plugging it directly into any of several machines I have with native PS/2 ports.<br /><br />I also tried using it with an IBM keyboard from around the year 2000 -- and it didn't work, either.  That keyboard does work, again, on a machine with a real PS/2 port."
5.0,I have used my memory cards for shooting video with GoPro cameras and pictures with my Canon Digital SLR.  I have never had an issue and continue to use these memory cards in all of my cameras.
1.0,"I'm giving this only a 1 Star since it has not been installed yet.  The Insignia Table/PC that it has to be attached, is to be given to my youngest daughter, who will install it herself, when she comes to visit me in December.  I am far sighted, and if I'll install it before she picks it up, I might not do it, as good as it should be."
2.0,"failed after 7 months.<br />time, effort, & cost of RMA almost not worth it"
3.0,The wheel just snapped while using a few months ago. It does not fit very well into my hand but its better than a few others that I have used. Bought it on sale for around 15$ so cant complain I guess
5.0,"Wanted a backup cord to my iphone 5S, to keep in my work travel bag.  Lower cost compared to other retail outlets, and just as good as the original one that came with the iphone.  No issues in synching either."
1.0,This item did not work. It took around 3 weeks to be delivered.
4.0,It works as advertising.
4.0,"Does what it says on the box! Small and light, easy to carry around.  Would be nice if the tail cable folded over a bit more, but very useful. Linux users may need to check they have the right kernel module, but it does work with Linux."
5.0,gud stuff

1.0,"Just like Markus L. Nightmare of a case. I tried to save money (didn't want to spend $600+ on an iMac case). Now I have a worthless $200 iLugger and a $600 cracked screen repair bill from apple = $800 I could've spent on a case that would've actually protected the Mac. Cardboard box it shipped in would've been better. Take it from myself and Markus. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!<br /><br />(for the record - I was very careful when transporting the mac in the case. I didn't assume this thing could take much abuse, but I figured it would be better than nothing. It's not)"
2.0,Bad service and don't by it. Thank you so much
3.0,"The delivery time was fast. I ordered the red, but is not the red that I wish. the tone is very clear even when I put on my Mac. I looked so much the red option in others brands and thought this would be the indicated. Fits good on my retina display 13 model A1502."

2.0,"These appear to be well constructed and at first appear to fit well with my phone (Samsung S6).  Over a week however, the micro USB connection to my phone became loose and did not fit tightly with the connection easily detaching.  I cannot hold the phone in my hand when charging because the USB will detach from my phone.  Furthermore, because of the loose fit, I am applying a lot of force to make it connect to my phone and in the process likely damaging my phone's USB input.  I would stay away."

2.0,"I owned a Synology NAS for two years and when I needed to buy two more I went with Synology again.  The problem is that I used the old one strictly as a NAS and kept trying to find the time to use all the neat software packages that came with a Synology NAS.  Now that I have these two brand new ones I figured I would try the Cloud Sync, DS Video, Cloud Station etc.  Wow, what a disaster.  I have been trying for several days and Cloud Sync simply will not authorize.  Cloud Station; there is not enough space to describe the problems.  DS video has been a huge disappointment.  Syncing between two Synology devices is suppose to be part of the apps but I have yet to see that work.<br />My DS Video movies do not match the ones on the Synology NAS.  During the adding of the media there was some incorrect matches which is completely understandable.  It did shock my wife when a very old Zorro serial from the '30s come up as an erotica movie.  These were fixed, re-indexed etc.  However, the mobile apps still show all the original titles.  Including the erotica movie, a bit awkward when showing the DS Video app to a co-worker.<br />Bottom line is that the Synology boxes appear to be very good network attached storage and that is all.  If that is all then they are very much over priced.  It is a shame because I was hoping for more and spent a heck of a lot to get there."
4.0,"Good card at a good price but I bought it specifically for my gopro camera. Even though its a class 10, its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings. I guess not all class 10 are the same even among the exact same cards. You will need to buy the extreme version for gopro."
2.0,Horrible to put on and does not quite fit.... I even re ordered and made sure I had the right one for my nextbook... Poor quality...
4.0,Sturdy and works well.
1.0,I am very disappointed with my purchase!  I love the RooCase I bought for my Kindle 7 HDX!  Not so for this Apple Air case.  Magnets will not hold in either of the stand positions!  I can barely tell there are magnets where they are supposed to be!  I will need to send back!  Cannot recommend this case!
1.0,Does not hold my sd card securely and when transferring files to the memory card it keeps disconnecting..... and all 6 of them that i have are doing it... so its not just one faulty reader.
5.0,I've used this card for about 3 months now and have not had a bit of trouble.  I notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full HD video.
5.0,Works as advertised for my Samsung GN2 Smartphone.  Got one for my dad's Samsung GS3 too.  Sandisk is simply the most reliable hi-cap micro SD flash memory out there.
5.0,perfect just as described
2.0,No pass through for charging while keyboard is connected.
2.0,"The case looks good on the laptop, but within a few weeks it already chipped and pieces have broken off.  Also, I don't feel like the top piece fits correctly, can't clasp it down to cover the edge like i'm able to with my other MacBooks/cases.  Helps avoid scratches, but with how it's breaking off and chipping, it's not really protecting the computer."
4.0,Good product at a good price. I am using it a lot.
5.0,Great gift for my wife. She loves it.
1.0,"My son had this drive for a few years and it crashed without any warning.  He lost all of his data of creative projects.  I contacted Lacie and they referred me to a data recovery service so I contacted Seagate Recovery Services.  They have a minimum fee of $500 to just receive and inspect the item.  Basically for your average customer this is a staggering sum and Lacie might as well told me we were out of luck. Nice looking design but, buy this product at your own risk."
4.0,"And it got stuck in the adapter they sent with it, had to break that open.  It fit in another adapter though"

1.0,"Piece of junk, purchased two, have tried on three different operating systems and PCs and they just does not work.<br /><br />Do not waste your money"
5.0,The price alone makes this product well worth it and being a class 10 and not having to pay a lot to get a quality disk is rare which is why I choose to order from amazon
5.0,"Has worked flawlessly with my GoPro Hero 3 Black since I placed it in the camera. Purchased 2 top have on hand.

I recommend this card to anyone needing a class 10 card that can handle the workload.half second timelapse, 2.7k HD video, 720p-120p video, not a problem for this card."

I might not use it next time."
4.0,"Received this battery in a timely manner, and it's working fine."
3.0,"The switch does what it is supposed to do for the exception of one thing. The cat5 ends on the back aren't fully attached. So when you try to attach an Ethernet cable into it, the connections go back into the case, making a solid connection hard to get."
4.0,so good
2.0,Lasted a few months then the pin got stuck in my phone and it broke.
1.0,I dont like it bad quality
5.0,"This card is fast and flawless. Still have not been able to fill it up, and I do have a lot of music in it."
3.0,It's OK - does the job and doesn't fail - but I don't like the fact that it does not indicate how much is on it.  My smaller Lexar has a &#34;scale bar&#34; on the face that indicates how much info is stored.  This one must be plugged in and you must look at the file explorer to see how much is on it.
3.0,I had bubbles on mine after I applied it. I tried the rubber bands and it helped!
3.0,very good and sturdy comes with different attachments to fit you Cd slot just beware of police can be an &#34;obstruction of view ticket&#34;
5.0,The signal is great and its easy to setup.
4.0,"I noticed amazon had the 'ultra' version for only a couple bucks more than the standard black version. And this one comes with an SD adapter in case I ever need it. I haven't bothered to speed test it since I'm using it for the tablet and don't feel like removing it from the tablet just for a test - but seems fast enough from my experience so far. Definitely faster than the regular black sandisk cards.From my experience with Sandisk products, their read/write speeds are much faster than they claim in their conservative estimates. It's not worth messing with their standard line if you can get 'ultra', 'extreme', or 'pro' for not much more."
2.0,"It's just okay.  Design idea is good, but the brown outer cover keeps &#34;unbuckling&#34; from the black section.  Plus there was a funny smell when we originally received this.  It was such a good price we decided to keep it, instead of the hassle of returning it.  It's just that we use it without the outside cover."
4.0,"don't actually have a &#34;review&#34; yet.  only recently received this item and so far it does what it should, so i am totally satisfied.  i am more than pleased with the price and availability.  so far so good.  my work is backed up and it travels with me and that's what i wanted from this item"
4.0,"So it will increase the range you recieve by a lot.  I live in apartments and the router is all the way down the hall. 100-150&#34; through multiple walls ect...before I was getting only 2 bars and not enough signal to even get on Amazon or Facebook, couldn't complete a speed test or anything.  So I got this product installed the drivers and thats where everything went wrong. (8/28/2015) The CD that comes with this device works, but it slows your internet down so much and I don't know why.  With the meditek ui I was getting random signal and very low throughput transmitting.  Now the signal before this was horrible, and with the drivers I could barely watch a youtube video, and facebook barely loaded. I know this is due to interfernece and stuff but hey I got this for that reason.   (8/29/2015) After doing some tests with my laptop (almost 6 years old) I was getting better consistent signal.  So I plugged in the adapter and got the same results.  Now I installed the software and I got random signal drops among others.  I know it scans frequently but so did my other programs.  Good antenna, but horrible software that comes with it.  Also had to use a TCP optimizer before the transmitted throughput would stay at a reasonable level. May end up returning and use laptop as wifi antenna since they both pick up the same strength of signal, except my laptop doesn't randomly disconnect from the internet.  (8/30/2015) Well was able to get one decent night out of this device, but for the price the struggle isn't worth it.  Still random dropped connections, 1Mbps to 72Mbps received and when it's 50-70's it works great, but usually has to restart.  I've decided to return this Monday and I'm either going with a different antenna or I'll be switching internet packages."
1.0,"Difficult to apply, perhaps because of cheep quality"
1.0,"It does scratch the iPad surface, even after meticulously ensuring clean surfaces of both.  I use it with Notability and several other note taking apps.  If you write fast, strokes will be erased.  This makes what you've written illegible and defeats the purpose of taking notes with it.  The design is nice in the precision it allows.  The clicking while writing is distracting in a meeting room.  I did better with the less expensive fiber tipped styluses from The Friendly Swede.  I waited too long to return it."
2.0,did not work for my laptop
4.0,Quick way to hook up computer output from laptop to Toslink input on audio receiver. Laptop does Netflix loads a lot faster on laptop than budget blu-ray dvd players
5.0,This keyboard cover was exactly what I was looking for! The color and print is exactly as pictured and it was extremely easy to put on my Macbook Pro 13 inch keyboard.
1.0,"Has not worked from day 1.  Accepts a few files, then gives an error message that the files are not found.  Formatting the disc helps for about 2 minutes, then the same problem reoccurs with a different file.  Had very good experience with smaller capacity Kingston memory sticks in the past, have been using them for years.  But this one is getting returned to Amazon."
3.0,Good product.  Pyramid configuration doesn't hold well.  iPad slides flats.
4.0,good for price
1.0,It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
4.0,Good stuff... but need better manual
5.0,There is not much more you can ask for than that. I will be buying more for my airport boredom fighting collection.
1.0,"cheap plastic, bottom kept coming off..."
2.0,I returned this item I thought it included the tablet and I needed the tablet it was my mistake  Thanks
1.0,Does not charge
4.0,"Good case, it is nice that it comes with an SD adapter, fast transfer of pictures, over all good memory card."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for a relative and she loves it.  I have a similar case made by Samsonite which was MUCH more expensive and I love, but this one seems to be pretty good quality and you can not beat the price.  I saw the exact same case (not similar, the exact same one) at Office Depot and it cost about 50% more at their store.<br /><br />I bought it for my 60 year old Aunt, who is an accountant.  She was carrying a heavy computer bag and a separate bag for paperwork (which was also heavy) every day in and out of her office.  This case replaced both bags and now she doesn't have to lift or carry that heavy load in and out of her office every day."
3.0,"I have mixed feeling about this case. I like the color and the material. The magnetic lock/unlock works as expected.<br /><br />However the ridge/hinge is significant. Maybe that's unavoidable. It's not the end of the world.<br /><br />There are two bigger problems. First, the opening for the power/dock connector is a little small and none of the cables I have fit well. A little work with a rat-tail file will address that. Second, the case rests too closely on the power switch which means that holding the case wrong can easily cause the power button to be activated, turning the iPad off at inopportune times.<br /><br />Again I think this is fixable using the file/rasp but I also think both of these issues could have been addressed in the product design or represent poor construction."
2.0,Very flimsy product.
4.0,I bought these for my kids tablets and for their action cameras. They work in those 2 devices. Some other devices seem to like the slower cards.
3.0,"This is my second Drobo; I got the 800FS a couple years ago.  Although I liked the idea of the 800FS, (reliable, foolproof, flexible) I found the speed (or lack of it) to be so bad it made the unit unusable.  I also did not like the fact I couldn't manage security properly. PROS: The 800i fixed all that.  It is much faster, and security is a breeze.  In fact in all the most important ways, it behaves like it was installed right in my computer. Having fixed all the technical issues, my only complaint is the price (but all these NAS drives are way overpriced). If you need a good reliable RAID like system, this is the solution for you.  Real plug and play once you know what you are doing and their techies will walk you through iSCSI with a smile. CONS: When the DROBO warranty runs out, you are screwed.  Extending it will cost an unsupportable $250 or so PER YEAR.  A lot of the inner workings are &#34;proprietary&#34; and the techs won't share that.  So you are on the hook for a whole lotta money or like me, you are thinking about selling this thing online.  If Drobo opened up their tech department or went open code, I would be their friend for life.  As it is, it's a great solution for a year, then it's a high end doorstop."
4.0,I love the graphic on this skin but it has one problem. Each corner has a small slit so that it will fit well but the slit areas are lifting up after only one month on my laptop.
2.0,It broke too fast.
4.0,This is the first of these I've had.  It works as mentioned and have had not problems with it.  Satisfied.
2.0,"Pretty good overall.  Product says 8gb, but after the OS and other default software, you only have 5 gb for your own use.  Would be better with some more storage space.  With only 5gb it can't really replace my other tablet."
3.0,"Just a regular keyboard nothing really amazing, flat laptop type keys, cheap though that's the best part"
5.0,"Ayyy what can you say. It works. It used to have a delay for my phone recognizing it and all the data on it, but that may be a phone problem. Got it for $42.99 on black friday. Can't knock it at all. *****FIVE STARS*****"
5.0,Received quickly and works great!
3.0,Works for what I paid for it
5.0,"The first few weeks after I bought this, I had some problems (like my phone can't detect the micro SD card). I tried formatting or repairing the card, but no success. So I returned this to SanDisk and they willingly replaced this in a week. No more questions asked. And since then, I'm still using the 2nd card that I received. No problems until now."
3.0,Cord that plugs into the laptop is loose and frequently falls out.
3.0,"This worked fairly well in a 1,600 square foot home.  Not quite so well in a 3,800 square foot home.  I.e., I'd recommend buying this if you don't need it to reach that far, but go with something more robust if you're in need of longer distance performance."
1.0,"Very unhappy with product quality. Extremely cheap item. By the time I would pay return shipping though, I would only have $1 of my money refunded. Awful!"
2.0,I bought this for my Samsung galaxy s4. I don't know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time. My wife's phone doesn't do it as often but still does it. Very fast but unreliable. I have had many sandisk before and this is the only one I have had problems with. I have read that there were some that were poorly made. Thinking I will send it back and give it another chance.
2.0,"I attend a lot of meetings at construction sites for my job and my notes are a very important aspect. I recently acquired an iPad to replace my laptop while out in the field, for practical reasons.<br />I wanted to see if I could make the switch from paper notes to taking notes on my iPad.<br />After extensive research and having read countless reviews, I pulled the trigger on the Jot Script 2 in conjunction with the Goodnotes app.<br />Unfortunately I have to conclude that there is no efficiency gain to be made by using the stylus compared to pen & paper.<br />The stylus writes pretty accurate in Goodnotes but there is always an ever so slight lag, which gives the whole experience an unnatural feeling.<br />The times I tried to use the stylus in the field, I soon gave up and grabbed pen & paper.<br />Drawbacks I've experienced were:<br />Taking a quick note is practically out of the question, the stylus is most likely off and not paired by the time you want to use it.<br />The battery seemed to drain whether or not the stylus was turned off, most likely the side switch had been pushed inadvertently while in my bag or pocket. A number of times I was unable to use the stylus due to a drained battery.<br />The lack of pocket clip is a serious design flaw. Put it down on a table and I guarantee you it will be on the floor soon. I would love to hear Adonit's product designer's explanation for this.<br />General conclusion: though it is a well-made and generally clever product, it cannot be practically used for what it is generally advertised.<br />I returned it to Amazon."
2.0,"Within 2.5 months of casual and careful daily use, the right earpiece is starting to rattle, and the tops of the pads are worn to the point that the hard inner part rubs painfully on my ear during use. Volume has never been loud enough to do any damage to the headset."
3.0,"Did not used, once returned Vimtag camera."
3.0,"I bought this because I did not want to drill holes and tear up drywall to run new wiring to our new T.V.  We set up the new T.V. in the middle of the house where there is no good way to run wiring without opening drywall.<br /><br />The IO GEAR GW3DHDKIT installs in minutes. I have the transmitter setup in a room that already had a Direct TV Genie box running. I have the receiver setup one wall away and about 18 feet away.<br /><br />When it is working it has a great picture and the sound is good too.<br /><br />The issues:<br />Every now and then when you turn on the TV the IOGEAR transmission just starts to flip out. I have noticed it always does this on the IOGEAR channel 8 and 9. I have to turn off the unit to try and reset it. I wish there was a way to make it stay on one channel so I could avoid channel  8 and 9.<br /><br />When I fast forward and sometimes when I pause the Direct TV Genie the IOGEAR starts to look for a new channel and it blanks out the screen for 15-30 seconds while it is doing this and I really hope it does not end up on channel 8 or 9 because I have to turn it off to reset it then. This is very annoying when you are trying to fast forward through commercials, I would say it does this 2 out of 3 times.<br /><br />I have tried moving both the transmitter and receiver to different locations to try and mitigate these problems but to no avail, it is always the same no mater where I put either unit."
1.0,DON'T BUY! I bought this thinking it would be ideal for what I needed. Many fans with good ventilation. Started out great but it stopped working just after the 30 days. Now I can't return to exchange for another because it's after their 30 days return policy.VERY UPSETTING!
4.0,This bag is way awesome..for school and weekend trips ..we love it.
5.0,"Bought this for my Raspberry Pi. Works great, it's fast and reasonably priced, and I have not experienced any issues with it yet."
4.0,My 7 year bought this with his birthday money.  He is really excited about it and has loaded some apps and games which he had no problems with.  I only gave 4 stars so far because the touch screen sensitivity seems off sometimes.  We're trying to adjust it or see if the screen protector is interfering.  So far he is very pleased.  I think it is a great value for the money.
2.0,The grip is too small for me. I have to squeeze the button pretty tight.
2.0,"having a real hard time with Windows 10 and this device, any help would be great!"
1.0,"I have 5 of these, one in white and the others in black.  The white one broke from the inside and was replaced with the life time warranty, as stated.  Then 2 out of the other 4, that I purchase in black went or broke from the inside.  Contacted person about replacing the other 2 that stopped working.  No response or replacement on cables.  They don't stand behind the life time warranty, as stated.  Will not be buying or doing business, with this outfit again, unless they fix the issue.  This is why they get 1 star."
5.0,"This joystick rocks!  Great grip, easy to program the buttons!"
2.0,It doesnt fit well and the auto wake and shut off doesnt work.  I plan to return it.  Case seems made well but I wanted it for the auto on/off feature
2.0,I have had 2 of these...both work for a few months
5.0,"I bought this card as high speed external memory for my Asus ME302C tablet to play movies, music, etc. The card meets all of my expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had absolutely no crapware preloaded. No compatibility issues whatsoever."
4.0,Did not realize you have to pay a annual fee also alot of advertisement  on this
1.0,Broke right away
1.0,doesnt work with any of the things that i put it up to.<br />also if you are looking for this to use on a game console then it doesnt work
4.0,The case is nice I did not read it all I thought when you closed the flap it would go into sleep mode this one does not.  I was a little disappointed that it did not.  I like the flap that lets it stand up right all in all it is a nice case for the Kindle fire.
5.0,"This thing is seriously solid, making for a very heavy heat sink and stable upright stand. The quality couldn’t be better, perfectly matching the Mac finish. Excited to have more desktop free space and to have the peace of mind from the extra cooling and performance. It is about time someone created a product like this!"
3.0,Not overly whelmed. It served it's purpose which was to help my grandson with his homework
2.0,I like how it works but 6 weeks after I bought it a piece broke off and now the magnet pulls out anytime I need to separate it from the iPad. It's past the 30 day return and I can't find a way to contact them to have it repaired or replaced. I would say not worth the cost. It should last more than 6 weeks.
4.0,It's a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it's acceptable to me. I like it.
4.0,"I wish it &#34;connected&#34; with my iPad a bit better (I don't know the word for it, but it seems to not work nearly as well as my finger), but overall ok."
3.0,Just ok  for the price you can't go wrong
3.0,"Its a nice pair of headphones. Suits all of my needs. But the main problem you should be aware of is strain on the 3.5mm jack. its made of a soft material and will wear out easily depending on how much you use the headphones without the usb. It does work on phones and retains all its functionality(that doesn't require the special software) but the cord is really long and a bit annoying when walking around. These are a nice pair of headphones that will wear out really easily, you will at some point make use of that warranty."
4.0,This is big and fast for me. I prefer having this side so I wont run out of space and the speed of 32+/- is all I need anyways.  Highly recommend it.
5.0,"Not much more to say, I've tried many and these are the very best (speed, price, reliability, compatibility.)  I highly recommend these cards."
1.0,"Bought 6, three have already stopped working. I'd return them, but I'm sure it would become a huge hassle. Just take my word for it. Buy a different product."
2.0,"im using this card on my galaxy note 2 but it's slow, and phone constantly unable to read the card"
1.0,"I have not had to file a claim on the warranty that came with my washer-dryer units (well, it didn't come with them, I bought the extended warranties). The booklet that came with my policy noticed spoke of replacing the unit(s) &#34;free of charge&#34; on multiple occasions, but the actual warranty document states that the maximum coverage is the original cost of the item. Therefore, if they spend money on a repair, and then the unit dies a year later, I will receive what I paid for the unit minus the cost of the repair they paid for -- and two years later the model(s) I bought may no longer be available and what is available may be more expensive. So, there is no &#34;replacement at no charge.&#34; This is blatant dishonesty and I'm going to insist on getting the price of the extended warranties back from the appliance dealer. I am incredulous that in California, this kind of bait-and-switch tactic is allowed."
5.0,"This tiny little card fit right into the slot on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The tablet recognized it right away and after some tweaking we are using the card as a storage backup for music, photos and video."
1.0,Did not purchase this item.
3.0,"I use a MacBook Pro and while downloading the driver for Macs was easy enough on the AOC site, not being able to control the contrast or brightness on the monitor became a big problem.  Within an hour my eyes hurt and I had a headache.  The monitor was too bright and seemed like it was vibrating.  I messed with the display options/tried to download programs to control external monitor brightness, but nothing worked.  You can't even calibrate properly without being able to control the brightness/contrast.<br /><br />This is a really great deal for the price, but i recommend only using with PCs.  I've looked in to it a bit and looks like for mac users GeChic monitors are a better option."
1.0,5 feet from my modem/router and im getting dial-up speeds.  skip this one.
5.0,"I use this memory card in my Galaxy S3, and though I had some issues getting it formatted correctly (this is the phone's fault) it works like a dream and have had ZERO issues."
4.0,Very good
4.0,"Great coverage,  feels nice."
2.0,2 stars for how fast i received package but as soon as i attempted to use the HD it was defective and gave my xbox red rings.
5.0,A lot of extra storage space with this card. Quality brand name. A bit pricey in my opinion. Great product overall though.
2.0,Didn't work with Comcast
4.0,Comore esta memorka para completar mi nueva samsunb galaxy tab y funciono muy bien...ahora tengo 48 gb de memoria para alamcenar info.
3.0,"The minion decal for the Mac Book Pro 13&#34; retina is nice but with some minor flaws.  There are some slight discoloration on the minion that's doing the karate kick.  His head is not entirely yellow.  Other than that, it's a pretty nice decal.  The instructions were clear on how to put on the decal.  It was not difficult.  However, take your time putting it on to prevent any air bubbles.  Once you have air bubbles under the decal, it's pretty difficult rubbing it out. If you are trying to rub out the air bubble, don't press down to hard or you might get a slight tear.<br /><br />Even though my decal had some discoloration, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  It's not perfect but then again, I only paid $8."
5.0,"Super fast access to my Samsung Galaxy Note II. SanDisk Ultra Micro HC is blazing fast compared to the other microSD cards I have bought including PNY, Sony and more!"
3.0,Good picture easy to down load stuff but the volume is so low it's hard to hear it and there is no way to increase the volume unless you have superior hearing like bionic woman it's not a good buy
3.0,i am not sure if this might be to big for my computer?  it doesn't fit right on the corners.  other then<br />that i like it.
1.0,bad quality product. Do not buy it.
5.0,Just as advertised.
5.0,Great write speed and lots of space! I bought this for my Galaxy S3 and formatted to Fat32 and it works great!
4.0,Feels great! The only warning I have is when zipped keep the zippers to the top and be mindful how you open the case. Your computer can accidentally fall. If you are cautious this case is great!
5.0,"Why would you get anything less?  64GB of instantaneous movies, video, music or pictures.  If you have an Android phone that's capable of accepting micro SD cards go ahead and get you one or two."
3.0,"Speed, graphics are great. Lightweight and thin. The only problem is that the keyboard is different that what was advertised. It has many extra keys. The product picture was of the computer with a standard keyboard.<br />If the laptop was shipped as advertised it would be 5 star. I am surprised at Amazon for misrepresenting the item."
1.0,this tablet is the worst tablet i bought three of them and they not working i got cheated on it i guess the case fooled me. the tablets not coming on it was a waste of money
3.0,"This device does not transmit sound as the DisplayPort and HDMI will. It converts the DisplayPort signal to a DVI signal which is sent over HDMI. So if you plan on using this adapter to connect your computer to TV expecting picture and sound, THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK!"
3.0,"cost too much money for what you get, a plastic box made in China"
3.0,"Is an excellent router, install it is very easy"
1.0,this product is a clear rip off of the speck cases and was supposed to include a keyboard that never came. It was a flimsy piece of 99 cent plastic from china.
2.0,This headphone looks great and fits even me with a larger head great. Yet it came with a blown out right speaker also the ear phones them self's feel cheap like a hollow plastic shell with tiny speakers in each side. Normally not a issue but its pretty off putting here. I am returning these ASAP and going with another brand as these are there mid-high end headphones I don't expect there to be better with other headsets from the manufacture.
5.0,"I used this card to reply a Class 4 on my Fujfiilm X20 and the writing speed is much better now. Before, after shooting a picture in RAW format, highest quality, it took 8 blinks on the LED for the image to be written, with this card the time is 5 blinks. This is a substantial increment in speed."
5.0,"Not much to say about the excellence of SanDisk products. Fits well, adapter very easy to use. I never been disappointed in SanDisk."
1.0,The download will not complete.  Pad does not connect to laptop.  I will return this item.
4.0,Just as it shows it came with everything:D
1.0,Damaged!!!!<br />Can provide pic if needed!!!!
4.0,"Hardware? Outstanding! Software? Horrendous!<br /><br />This item is tiny and works extremely well.  It comes with a short cable to connect to your computer.  It's very inexpensive. Perfect.<br /><br />However, I strongly suggest letting Windows (7 in my case) detecting the device the first time you plug it in and see if you can do what you wish to do with generic Microsoft drivers.  I found that the device worked perfectly with that setup.  When I tried installing the included software, I was surprised to find one of those obnoxious &#34;bloatware&#34; monsters giving birth to numerous ad-filled utilities all over my PC! I couldn't wait to uninstall it (them)!  Imagine my annoyance when I found that these programs were of the &#34;self-protecting&#34; type, that hid themselves from my uninstaller.<br /><br />Horrible.  I had to dig them all out and then clean up the mess with CCleaner.<br /><br />Samsung deserves high marks for the hardware but they should be ashamed of themselves for including such terrible software to unsuspecting buyers, IMHO."
1.0,"Worked fine on the 15V setting for about 3 weeks. Then one day it had no output, checked with meter and output was dead. No abuse, and never run hard, it's just unreliable. Advise against purchasing this item."
4.0,"works as expected and was nice that it came with a holder. Not sure what else you can say about a chip, either it works or it don't? One never knows until they use it for a while how it is working..."
2.0,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to rent a modem from WOW for $7 per month. Once I installed this, which was easy, it went offline sometimes 7 times a day when I never had trouble with the leased one. I suffered through 3 weeks of this and I gave up and sent it back for a refund. I don't know if I'll ever try to own my own modem again because this one was such a pain. Internet wouldn't stay on, speed dropped to 0.10 MBPS every day, I had technicians out twice and both agreed it was the modem. I now have a new leased modem again and internet is blazing fast again. This experience was awful and I can't recommend it to anyone unless you like reseting your modem all day every day."
4.0,"Fits well, magnetic closures work fine but are a bit weak. Deducted one star because the front cover has a cardboard core, and begins to warp after a few months of exposure to humid air. If you live in a humid place, this cover won't last you very long! (same goes for most cheap tablet covers on amazon... they all use cardboard cores)"
4.0,"The card was a bit difficult to install because it did not fit the PCI port perfectly. I had to unscrew the two screws and &#34;shorten&#34; the card by sliding it closer to the metal plate cover. After i made the modification, it was a snug fit, but it fit."
2.0,I wanted to like these but 5 seconds after I pulled the box open I knew I didn't. There is a major glaring flaw in the product. Each key has a number or a letter or both on the inside of it. The keys are semi-transparent. You can see where that fails? Every key has some manufacturing mark number on it that is visible because of the backlighting and transparency. Why oh why would anyone do that? They lost all possibility of even getting on my board right there. Useless. I give an extra star for packaging very nicely. I guess these go on the backup board while I put my favorite set on my main board.<br />Disclaimer: This is a non-essential snobbery item and thus the review is somewhat snobby.
3.0,This keyboard is bulky and loud!
1.0,"Purchased the product in June 2015 and just broke as of August 2015. Only lasted two months. It was used for gaming by a relative as a gift. It's beautifully presented the colors and design, however, I'm passed the 30 day return window and out of luck. It's affordable, and the colors are still working but that is it when plugged in. I can't move the cursor or anything else. A get what you pay for kinda thing. Either hardware quality not good enough or I just got a bad one. May be worth your purchase to see if it last longer."
4.0,"The cord is a bit short, but it works well."
5.0,What to be said???  Extra memory chips for my Gopro.  Small and compact for traveling.  They travel and work great
1.0,another joke it works when it wants to so it`s somewhere in the house a waste of more money
3.0,"After my Plantronics GameCom 780's broke (literally snapped in half) I decided to go a different route with my gaming headset. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones, and ran this mic through the coil of cable.<br /><br />The Good: The mic clips to the headphone cord and holds itself there securely. You never have to worry about positioning it, because it's always hanging by your mouth. Also, the cord is VERY long, so I had no problem connecting to my computer.<br /><br />The Bad: There are little clips on the wire that are designed to grip the cord. This is all well and good, but works terribly on a coiled headset. They turn into little barbs that grab the cable and bunch it up in weird places. You can't cut them off because they are fused to the plastic of the wire. Not a deal breaker for everyone, but annoying to coiled wire folk.<br />Also, the audio is not great. This should not come as a surprise to you, since it is a tiny mic, but the sound is very thin and not bassy at all. It does the job, but does not sound particularly good. If you talked into a webcam mic, you are getting basically the same sound.<br /><br />It's a very ok microphone, and the price is good, all things considered. But I am currently looking into getting something a little more robust."
1.0,dont waste your money. I tried to connect with to my tv from my tablet and phone. Did not work. I returned this product.
5.0,"I got a new phone and this was part of a dock and battery deal so I pulled the trigger. So far transfers have been fast and successful. It's only been a few months, but it just works."
2.0,"The case does not fit correctly, the edges are not smooth like they should be, and the corners are just plain ugly (as shown in the picture taken just after I got it in the mail). Long story short: this case is super cute but poorly made."
5.0,"Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available. No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space. I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it. Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)"
1.0,"it doesn work , its a garbage"
2.0,"this did not last very long. Would not work in any of my mobile devices. I tried it in 4 different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve. Not much use there, since i already have 2 TB"
2.0,Came with an external WIFI device and no indication that the internal WIFI card did not work. Packaging said I could contact the provider at any time but no contact info was provided? Unit works well as required.
1.0,I received this item as an xmas gift. While it does work good I stopped using is do to heat concerns. It gets very hot and starting to melt the plastic. recommend purchasing a different product. I am afraid it will catch on fire.
1.0,Misleading<br />This does not come with a cord to charge the device and does not say so in the details.  You have to buy it separately which is the whole reason I bought this was to charge my tablet because mine broke. Still can't charge it due to no cord came with it.
5.0,Works good
1.0,Does not work with any Apple products
5.0,Used it on my GoPro Hero 3 and works great found SanDisk to always make excellent products. Money well spent.
1.0,"Fortunately I got this as a lightning deal, so it wasn't that expensive.  I purchased it in October, but didn't start using it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 until January.  It was fine, until it wasn't.  It chose to die today.  Just a little more than four months after I started using it.  I checked my phone this morning and it told me that the SD card had been unmounted.  I did not think much of it.  But when I rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card, I began to be concerned.  When I got home from work, I put a different card in, and it worked fine.  I tried to check the card on my computer, and it couldn't be seen.  So the problem is definitely a card.  Unfortunately, I lost most of the pictures I've taken since getting this phone.  I know that I probably should have backed them up, but I really didn't expect the card to fail so quickly.  Perhaps if I'd read all of the one start posts before buying, I would have.  Oh well, back to my 16GB Amazon Class 10 card until I can get a different one.I'm not even going to bother with a warranty claim.  I don't need another card that will fail after four months."
2.0,"paid for this additional protection; however, it was not needed."
2.0,"The previous reviewers let me down on this one..  .Poor construction. Stand is not adjustable in any way, and is low and angled forward. It also slants to one side slightly, really. Very uncomfortable to view, I have it propped up on a large book right now. Picture is just ok, really have to mess with brightness and contrast to get a decent picture. (it's not pre-set out of the box?) The main reason I bought this was the built in speakers for space saving reasons.  I did not expect great sound, but these sound horrible. Like the old-school pc speakers that were built in to computers before they made external speakers; tinny."
4.0,"This cooling pad has lasted a lot longer than any other cooling pad I've purchased, and it's super quiet."
5.0,This sd card works great! I haven't had an issue with it since I bought it and I don't expect to have any issues at all!
3.0,"I like everything about the Fire HD except watching videos.  I usually use it for reading books, etc - and it's great for that, but when I try to watch an Amazon Prime Video it just bogs down.  I watch a couple of minutes and then it stops to load, the it's good for a couple more minutes and back to reload, and so forth.  I don't think it's my wireless network because I can go to my Kindle app on my Note4 and watch the same movie with no problems.  It just seems that the Fire just doesn't have much processing power. This is my third Kindle and I don't think I'll be buying another - I'll just use the Kindle app on some other device."
2.0,"Like the mount and worked great for 8 months, EXCEPT... When I was pulling the unit back down after having it folded up against the cabinet, the grommet that holds the mount in the arm broke off. Can't be fixed. Sad day."
4.0,Very good!
2.0,Sent the first pair back because of buzzing noise from left speaker. Amazon replaced promptly but new set only marginally better. Not a great product.
4.0,"It charges my phone,  I was looking for something that would charge my tf101 tablet.  guess I clicked and ordered the wrong thing. but there is always room at my house for another microusb 2 amp charger"
1.0,"Does not work, ordered two and neither have produced sound in the 6 weeks I have been trying to get them to connect on my laptops. Amazon will now not accept a return since its past 30 days."
1.0,"Day I bought it, it would randomly disconnect within a foot of the wireless receiver, even after updating the firmware.  The sound quality of the headset isn't that good either as well as it's pseudo surround sound feature.  If you're going to invest money in a good headset, invest in a Sennheiser.  Not only do they sound much better, the build quality matches.<br /><br />This is definitely a headset that is getting returned."
5.0,excelente
1.0,Didn't even work
1.0,"These are for people with extremely small ears, and if you can get them to fit comfortably don't expect amazing audio either. my 15$ jvc headphones are 100 times better do yourself a favor and go with a much better brand or model. So far this is definitely on the list of my biggest purchase regrets. If I can't return it and get some amount of my money back these are going straight in the garbage most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn, airplane headphones offer more comfort."
3.0,"Firstly, I want to say I like the unit but it does not have the best quality control. The first unit I bought had an issue with the HDMI port... it was to recessed and the plug did not make a good connection. Returned it and the second one was OK. The real issue I have with Nextbook is there tech support, if you can call it that. Call support and expect to wait at least 10 minutes holding on the phone for a person. Then what you get is a rep that is more customer service then tech. They are not trained techs. Ask them more than how to turn on the tablet and you will get a song and a dance but the bottom line is they don't know. I asked a rep about using  WIFI Direct and he didn't know what WIFI Direct was.<br />If your going to use the unit for light duty application it's good but for something more complicated there will be issues."
3.0,Mine fits perfectly. But it came in with a big scratch in the front
1.0,The first cord I ordered broke. I figured I was being rough with it. I ordered two more because it did work and was one of few cords that fits a lifeproof case. Now one of them has stopped charging. I am not finding anyway to receive a replacement or refund. Not cool. I will have to bite the bullet and buy from Apple
3.0,"Pretty, but does not feel like genuine leather"
2.0,"Came by the expected date. Also came with a nice pouch. However, the connection is a tad bit faulty. I ordered this adapter to connect our lab's Mac to our Optoma projector. The projector has a VGA cable connected to it, and this adapter in turn needs to be connected to this cable via the VGA-port-side, and then mini-DVI side goes into the port on our Mac. When I tried this for our lab meeting power point presentation, the slides projected just fine, however there was the &#34;blue-wash&#34; over the screen that occurs when the connections between display cables and ports are not completely flush. However, I made sure the DVI to MAC and the VGA to connecting cable were inserted as deeply and securely as possible, and yet the connection was still faulty. I had to bend the adapter cable 90 degree to the left and hold it in place with a heavy object for the projection to be completely clear. So it worked, finally, but only with some finagling. Unfortunately I have to bend it a little every time to get the projection to be clear, which isn't a terrible inconvenience but not worth 4 or 5 stars. (I am keeping in mind that the problem could be with the VGA cable to projector connection, however, this has always worked with no issues in the past with other connecting DVI to VGA Adapter cables, this new cable I ordered has been the only thing to bring about issues)."
2.0,"I was so hopeful for this product as it was just the perfect size and exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately less than two months of gentle use, the hinge has broken resulting in the keyboard no longer attached and my iPad without a case. I'm having trouble getting a response from the seller and am disappointed with the quality of this product and am unable to recommend it."
3.0,I have had the mouse for just under two months. It worked well until the other day when the right click became overly sensitive to the point that blowing on it will cause it to click. Until this point it worked wonderfully.
1.0,I paid 157.00 after the price with shipping and it is already giving me problems and I have not even had the item for a week...the Kindle will not stop freezing and the screen keeps going black... I am started to think I received a refurbished item because I should not be having these problems with the device this soon
1.0,"It worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S3, and then failed after 3 months.  Have tried contacting Samsung via their warranty form on their website and I am not having any luck.  I gave up and bought a different 32GB card from NewEgg.com hopefully that one lasts longer."
3.0,"It is hard to type on this computer. It registers other letters than what I typed. I don't know why, also I am going to put more hard drive into it to make it faster. it is OK. I had to upgrade to Windows 10. I just don't know why when I type certain keys they don't show up on the screen. I really wanted a Lenovo, but I couldn't afford it, I thought the keyboard would be better."
1.0,"Within minutes of plugging this in, there was a crackling sound and the smell of burning.  The indicator light went out and it will not charge my computer.  This product is terrible and a waste of money."
1.0,Within two weeks these cables no longer worked.  You will be safer purchasing this product from a known brand.
5.0,"No problems, been working non-stop for several weeks."
5.0,so cute
1.0,Only one of the three cords in this pack worked correctly. I would suggest you find a different brand!
1.0,"I purchased this router/modem combination in march of 2014 and the product now randomly stops broadcasting its SSID.  All wired connections to the unit continue to operate normally, but all wireless connections are dropped and cannot reconnect as the SSID is unavailable.  A hard reset corrects the problem for 1-2 days, after which the problem reappears and persists until another hard reset is performed.  So this unit is 5 months out of warranty and is basically useless.  After contacting Netgear about their defective product and being told that my one year warranty was up and no RMA was available I informed them that I would never purchase another Netgear product.  So here I am to tell you fine consumer, stay as far way from Netgear as you can.  Any company that refuses to stand behind their product does not deserve your hard earned dollars."
5.0,I got this for my tablet & have used this brand before on other things. It's a reliable brand & I never worry about quality with it.
1.0,"prefer Kindle, Edition 2 - no printed instructions included- doesn't give clear menu"
1.0,cuts out all the time
3.0,The finish is too slick for me.
5.0,Works great with my oldest computer which is still on XPsp3. Does what I need it to do.
2.0,"Not so easy to install, use all 3 protectors and still ended up with some dust bubble that I wast able to take out. It could be me, or the protectors, but I bought some for my IPad 2, from another seller and I  got it right the 1st time and they included great instructions."
3.0,I have had this computer 4 years with windows 7 and have loved it. Now I can install sp1 but when I do the updates no longer work. Have tried every thing. I now think it is this computer. I never had a problem with service packs with xp. I just can't get this to work and wont be able to update to windows 10. It does work well. If anyone wants to buy mine let me know. I think I will get a computer with windows 10 now. This is so frustrating since it really works well with just windows 7.
2.0,"My normal set of security drivers were misplaced during a recent house move. Needing to replace a Nexus battery before all the boxes can be unpacked, this low-priced seemed worth the risk. While I did replace the battery, it was touch and go at times.<br /><br />The driver heads are dicy during operation, the material is thin and not a perfect head shape. Using the phillips on a particularly tight screw when the driver slipped it became clear that the screwdriver would strip/break/deform ridiculously quick, Breaking tips/bits is always a risk, particularly in this gage range, but these are begging to break.<br /><br />The mount bars ended up being single use. After 5-10 movements the plastic was showing signs of fatigue. One ripped partially by the end of the battle to release the old battery from it's glue. A battle exasperated by the fact that the tip ( the end thins and then has a 120 degree bend )  of the mount bar instantly bent to the pressure exerted easily folding on the natural seam.<br /><br />The paddles were okay, and they'll live to see another operation. I didn't use any of the other tools, but I would expect similar experiences with them.<br />These got the job done although it took 3x as long. The tools really needed a delicate touch and I wasn't trying to have a disassembled phone.<br /><br />If I don't find my missing set I'll be buying a formal replacement, unfortunately these are disposable tools  - and that's just sad. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, these are cheap children's toys. I can't say one star because they did technically do what I needed them to do."
5.0,"It is very fast and very, very practical! I really like, almost able to use, and in my phone can play full HD, only great!"
3.0,"It works fine. Nothing too fancy, but we have no problem using it for some simple games on computer."
1.0,JUNK!!!! THROUGH IT AGAINST THE WALL YEAR AFTER BUYING THIS JUNK....
4.0,"Before buying my first Mac, I'd always used basic PC's and whatever peripherals came packaged with them. My Mac mini came with no peripherals. It didn't seem fully compatible with my junky old HP keyboard. This keyboard is a revelation. I love the feel of the keys, their firm touch and rssponsive-ness make typing much easier. What bothers me is the white color. It's dirty already, and I'm a very regular hand-washer. Yes, I could buy a heavy ugly plastic cover to type through; but that's like the ladies who keep their good living room furniture set encased in plastic so it won't get soiled. Completely undoes the beauty of the design. In general, I'm quite bemused by Apple design. I believe that function is as vital as beauty, and that the two must go hand in hand. Early iPhones with exquisite forms and plastic backs that scratch so easily that they must be hidden in those ghastly jelly cases? The sleekly elegant Mac mini that comes with no peripherals built in and only a few USB slots, so you need to add a big USB hub and an ugly tangle of cables for the back-up drive, keyboard, mouse, speakers, CD player, card reader, photo and laser printers. Enough of my Apple rant. The keyboard is smudged and glorious."
4.0,"Is really cute,  it looks really big in the picture but is actually perfect size not to small but perfect to carry a book, water bottle and other things."
3.0,The Ethernet port kept losing connection. Bought and external card and problem solved. Returning it is not an option since the computer being used for work and if I return it I will lose money. The external card was $20 so it was worth it.
1.0,Worst mouse I've ever used. It feels odd when moving it around on a mouse pad. It does not move smoothly. After just 2 weeks the left click button would not register until you click harder and sometimes would register 2 or more clicks from only clicking once. Dragging and dropping files became increasingly frustrating because of this. After 3 weeks the right click would register even when not clicking at all. Playing games was even more frustrating when losing only because a mouse failed to register a click at a critical moment. The low price is appealing but it would be much wiser to invest a little more for an effecient mouse and save yourself the frustration. And it wouldn't be cheap if you end up having to replace this mouse in just months.
4.0,"works extremely well with elite dangerous, more than enough buttons and all are well placed. my only gripe is that the throttle has a &#34;bump&#34; at 75% forward and reverse, which gets very annoying, i ended up upgrading to x55, and kept the 52 as a backup"
4.0,"I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 camera, as it was the one recommended by most buyers. I've had zero problems with the card, and the included adaptor makes it easy to transfer my videos to my PC. These things are tiny though, and thin so be careful not to bend or lose them! The $24 price is reasonable as well."
4.0,Works fine with photo shooting and video recording in EOS camera with the SD adapter. Perfect for tablet and phone memory.
4.0,I use this as my technician flash drive with my favorite live CDs and applications for system and network repair. It's faster than others in this price and size. I put it on my keychain and its been holding up fine.
3.0,Loves this notebook...but...would not turn on after a couple days...getting a replacement and if I does it again I will get a full refund
5.0,"Clean design, works great as expected"
5.0,its a cable and works as it should.
1.0,"It looked really nice..for the first few weeks. I purchased two of them for our computers, one started cracking on week three and the other cracked a month after. They both cracked in the corners and continuously chip off  when we open them. We're already replacing them. What a disappointment."
4.0,"Good hard drive case, especially for the price. Recommended."
1.0,"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013. There is at least one or more ""6 months and it failed"" reviews per page."
2.0,This product has a slight defect which makes it problematic to use as intended.<br /><br />After installing the battery - touchpad on my Acer S3 started behaving strange - it became oversensitive and also the left mouse click stopped working. I could press but there will be no click.<br /><br />I traced the problem to battery pressing against the touchpad. After a few install and uninstalls; I decided to pull out original battery and compare side by side. Turns out there is a thin piece of plastic  on original battery (see attached picture - top is original battery bottom is this battery by battery TEC) which keeps the battery up (by about 1mm) from the touchpad which is missing from this battery. Manufacture should look into this and fix. I tried to fix it by putting electrical tape - it is ugly but for now it seems to improve touchpad behavior.
5.0,"pretty, and fits perfect"
5.0,"Happily nestled in the memory slot of my Nook Tablet and performing as promised.  Now, if only the Nook memory slot were easier to access....  All well.  The card arrived on time, well packaged, and has been chugging right along for two months now.  I would definately recommend it to any lover of video, music, or other space consuming files."
3.0,WIsh they had more volume but the sound quality is excellent.
3.0,Symbols on keyboard are mixed..The at sign is not where it should be at number 2...annoys me
5.0,Battery was great.
5.0,Yeah baby. Love getting this amount of memory for so cheap. I'm not a pro but for everyday use it's a great deal.
4.0,"Great so far I upgraded to windows 10, no problem so far. I stalled Anti-Malware and Kaspersky, no problems so far. Did have 76 updates to install right off the bat took hours. Not impressed with the beatsaudio."
4.0,"I was hoping it would last a little longer.  Certainly better than the old, dead one we had, but we're only getting 1.5 hours or so out of this new one."
2.0,Kind of flimsy. Not very strong.
2.0,"It didn't meet the requirements of my note pad,"
4.0,The only reason not 5 stars is I'v not used the other connectors yet. GREAT!!!!!!
4.0,"I bought my last Anker about 18 months ago.... it performed well just about through the warranty period.  No complaints.  It's very difficult to keep a battery healthy, in my opinion, because even after you've conditioned the battery, it's not very good IN MY EXPERIENCE to keep a charge going to the battery after it is fully charged.  I keep my laptop in the same spot, so it's easy to forget to unplug the charger and let the battery actually do the work.  So long as you properly condition the battery per Anker's recommendations, you'll get very good performance.  And if you let the battery do what a battery does (ie, not keep it plugged in all the time), I think it will last a whole lot longer than 18 months."
2.0,Very disappointed.  After getting all set up this thing goes dark in about a quarter of the screen.  Returned it and bought a Viewsonic instead.
4.0,Bien
2.0,"The modem I received did not work with Atlantic Broadband. The tech said I need to get a replacement. I had to rent a modem and pay for the technicians, so I'm out basically $50 even though I received a full refund."
4.0,Great storage for the price (&#60; $1 per GB). The only draw-back is that they are rather slow to write to.
2.0,"Very upset that the back-light on the keyboard shuts off after 3 min, i would not have purchased this keyboard if i had known this.  I game in a dark room and use a mouse and game pad for game play, but when i go to type to the other players i have to hit a key in the dark to turn the lights on then hit backspace to get rid of the key i just pressed. The mouse just scrolls through all the colors and is very bright!!  There is NO way to turn off the light or change it to just red to match the keyboard, i do not use the mouse because of this.  it just sits in my parts box.  The mouse pad is beautiful!!!"
5.0,"Works great with my Nexus Player.  No configuration needed, just plug it in and go.  Throughput is fine (I haven't measured it).  My main problem with the Nexus Player is the lack of an Ethernet port, and this solves that easily."
4.0,"It definitely met my expectations with one exception.  For the life of me, I can not understand why there is no two way camera."
4.0,thank you very much! so much better than other brands. Works as good as original !
4.0,"I have been using it for a few months and its been pretty good, the keyboard isn't mechanical but it has its own character. The only complain I have is about the light as it is so bright, it wont be of much trouble in a normal lit room but in the dark its kind of annoying."
1.0,"I normally don't write reviews but I want to inform people on the issue I was having with this item. If you try to get raw images off of a SD card from this thing it just screws it up. First it takes way too long to load. Another reviewer mentioned 3.0 is not supported by Mac and that's that issue I believe I ran into. However, it corrupted all my files that it loaded on my computer. I used another add reader then and all the files that were loaded on my computer were corrupted from this card reader. So frustrating.  Glad I stopped loading the files part way through. Save yourself the headache and get something better if your working with RAW files on a Mac."
4.0,good product
2.0,Only charges via USB cord. Very inconvenient if you want to use with tablet or phone!
2.0,Only holds a charge for an hour after two calibrations.
3.0,it does have a chemical smell to it. hopefully it goes away. It is a good basic case though.
4.0,I wanted a micro SD card for a camera I purchased and this fit the bill at a reasonable price.Fit right in and works well
4.0,The only complaint I have about this kindle is that the camera takes &#34;grainy&#34; pictures. After trying everything to fix the problem the pictures are not good.
5.0,Great audio quality as well as a pretty good mic.  Extremely comfortable!
5.0,Great micro SD card for smartphones or other products. I wanted something with a high transfer rate so that taking HD video there would be no lag.
1.0,It has Bluetooth 2.0. It doesn't not state this anywhere. Some of my Bluetooth devices would not work with it because of this.<br /><br />Mine also had a defect with the screen. It almost looks like a crack but it is under the screen. I will never again buy an off brand tablet.<br /><br />I ended up returning mine and going with Acer Iconia Tab 10 A3-A20-K1AY.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone.
5.0,Changed my life. It is so good.
2.0,"Fantastic Product, Good Quality, very satisfied with this purchase!"
5.0,Not much to say. It works as expected. Recording speed is great with my GoPro Hero3. The SD adapter works gear as well.
5.0,Great deal for a great product. Recommended for anyone needing to expand the memory of their portable devices. Comes with SD adapter for use in card readers.
4.0,Works as advertized
3.0,Could not plug into my computer. Worked ok in my separate multi port device.
3.0,"Works well but the clamp was very cheap and literally fell apart with no way to reattach it. I now jerry-rig it to where I need it to be but a working clamp would be much easier! Otherwise, it stays in the position you bend it to and holds the device well!"
5.0,Already bought this one last may but you can't beat the new price. Original Sandisk products never failed me before. Just be careful where to buy.
2.0,I don't like the size and I am having hard time using as my hand is not working on the screen.
5.0,These have worked great at keeping our church iPads safe!
2.0,"It will work. It has some annoying problems I am sure can be fixed with firmware, software, and support site updates. Nothing is so inherently flawed that I would scream don't get it, but I expect better when spending $500 plus dollars between motherboard and process, nevermind RAM, heat sink, etc. to upgrade a system.<br /><br />I will write give another star when they fix the BIOS problems. I should probably take two stars away for this one, but even with all its problems I don't think it's really a one star board. Changing lots of basic settings will cause the BIOS to hang or boot excruciatingly slow. An example is disabling the onboard sound. I had no desire to leave it enabled and load needless drivers, because I use a wireless headset or the speakers on my monitor via the DisplayPort link from the graphics card. So there was lots of 'change a settings, see if it reboots, if not clear the cmos, if so add it to the list of things I want to change that work so that when I hit the next odd one I can run down the list again'. Not difficult but very time consuming and painful. I believe this might also be why on Newegg there is a review where one said it was DOA and another said he thought it was DOA until he cleared the CMOS.<br /><br />Once I got it as close to the settings I wanted and it would still boot it was fine until we got to loading drivers. Here I will give them another star when they fix their support/download site. I built a PC without an optical drive, loading Windows from USB. To that end I didn't just insert the disc it came with to get the drivers I needed. Instead I went online to the web site and even tried the live update. The Intel Management Engine driver seems to be nowhere besides on the disk. After doing a Google search and figuring out what the device ID was I was able to locate the driver on the CD and copy it over. I also don't recall the IO Serial Drivers online, although I was able to get them via the Live Update application, which isbetter than having to resort to the ISO, but still a pain.<br /><br />Finally, one extra star when MSI Fast Boot is actually just that and not MSI Obnoxious Boot. To be able to access the BIOS more easily with Fast Boot enabled it appears they have a Fast Boot utility. And every time you boot up it's in the system tray, which is fine, but what it doesn't need to do is pop up and ask me if I still want to leave Fast Boot enabled or go to the BIOS on the next boot. I realize I can easily stop it from loading automatically on boot, but that is one epically obnoxious default behavior for an application that is supposed to make things faster."
4.0,Exactly as advertised
2.0,"This product does the job. Unfortunately one of the two RAM slots does not work. Hopefully the rest of the components remain durable. Everything else seems to work well. Now that I have built this computer, put everything in place, screwed everything in and have things working the way I want to (aside from only having 8 GB RAM instead of 16 GB), I'd rather not return it; I might as well leave it in and save the motherboard for another computer to build. Also, beware there is no USB 3.0 20 pin connector on board to plug in any usb 3.0 slots from the front of a case, but it does have two usb 2.0 connectors on the board. I do wish I spent the extra $20-30 for a better board.<br />My Budget build:<br />- AMD X4 860k Quad Core 3.7 GHz Black edition (Definitely worth the money, but if you can afford it go for a quad core i5)<br />- PNY Nvidia Geforce gtx 750 ti (highly recommend it, especially if you can find it for under $100)<br />- 1 TB WD blue HDD<br />- Corsair Carbide 200 R case<br />- The $40 EVGA PSU<br />- 16 GB (4 x 2) Kingston HyperX Fury at 1866 MHz<br />- Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (Awesome, but massive, so make sure your case is wide enough for it; the 200 R case has less than an inch between the left panel and the cooler)"
4.0,"The mouse is fine as long as it is within 5 feet of the wireless usb. The keyboard however, is a catastrophe.  There is considerable input lag in the keyboard even if it is located close to the wireless usb. Sometimes the keystrokes aren't even recognized. If the keystrokes DO manage to get picked up by the usb receiver, there is also a chance that keystrokes are typed twice from one press of a key. Really annoying.  *UPDATE* September 18, 2015 So Anker customer support emailed me and said they would ship me another mouse and keyboard combo and stated that the first one I previously got was faulty. The new mouse and keyboard they sent me works fine for now. I haven't experienced any aggravating factors such as double inputs on the keyboard. The range is a lot better than the first one I got as well. I don't need to use a usb extension cord anymore in order to stay within 1 foot of the wireless usb. So far I'm happy with it. It is how I would expect a wireless keyboard and mouse to perform. Hopefully the quality of this keyboard won't decline in the near future."
2.0,I expected a fuller sound from speakers with four drivers of these dimensions.  I paid $25 and hoped they'd sound like $35.  Unfortunately I think they sound like $15 speakers.  I would not buy again.
1.0,This speaker has a built in power saving feature that turns the speaker off if it does not detect a signal from your computer.  I work in an office environment and need to keep the volume low.  After researching Creative's support site I tried their recommendation to adjust the computer volume setting to high.  This did not work.  I since sent Creative several emails and get the same answer to the issue.  I would not recommend these speakers.
2.0,Too wide for my PCU
4.0,Has really fast data transfer when plugged into a USB 3.0 port
4.0,I have had no problems with this memory card. Owned it a couple years and transfered it from phone to phone.
5.0,able to capture 1080p full Hd on my blackberry z10 now.  with my other card i was only able to do 720
5.0,its a micro sd card and it works. What more can you ask for.I have one for each of my electronic devices.
2.0,It fit my keyboard is expected although it is difficult to keep it in place at times
1.0,Could not get it to work with windows 8.1
3.0,"OK, but didn't suit my needs."
4.0,"SanDisk were the first Memory cards I came across years ago.  I think they hold up very well against the competition.  They are inexpensive and do the job.  I am a huge Kingston fan, but the price of this card was too hard to pass up.I currently have it in my phone for Photo & Video storage.  So far, no complaints."
2.0,"Don't waste your money on this one. The cover feels like it's made from a cheap plastic picnic tablecloth material, though the print was pretty. I did like the hand slip-on strap. The thing I liked least is that the tabs that are designed to hold the tablet in place are not strong. My Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4&#34; did not fit snug and securely. I returned it. Didn't give me peace of mind. I bought a Fintie brand cover instead--very nice quality."
5.0,"This card works great, it has lots of space and great transfer speeds.  It shipped quickly and the package was in great shape."
4.0,"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop away from home, so I was looking for something portable, sturdy and reliable (but really when aren't you looking for these qualities in things...) but at a low price.  So I looked and considered several different mice, including this one. Honestly I really wanted the Apple Magic Mouse, but did not want to pay that much since I wasn't going to use it very often.  That's when I came across this one, which I saw had decent reviews, Bluetooth, and most importantly was decently priced thanks to Amazon's Warehouse Deals.  When I got the mouse I was a little surprised at just how short it is, it very thin compared to say a standard mouse you'd see bundled with a desktop, but not small like a travel mouse (not sure how to really express that in a different way).  One feature that is mentioned with this mouse is the blue-track laser.  Now I can't give you specifics compared to a standard red laser, but I've used this mouse on all kinds of surfaces without a mouse pad over the past few weeks, and have not experienced any problems.  The reasons for me this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it feels a bit more &#34;plastic&#34; than I'd prefer and the mouse buttons are a little sensitive for my taste.  The mouse has a nice rubberized feel, and is very light, but just feels like thin plastic when you hold it, almost like it flexes a little in spots,  For the buttons (left and right, not the mousewheel which can act as a button as well), since it is so thin, there is not much travel on the button so it is more sensitive than I would like, just personal preference.<br /><br />So all in all I like this mouse and would definitely recommend it with those caveats that if you're not expecting something super sturdy, and don't mind sensitive buttons then go for it!"
2.0,Its time for Pyle to step up its game and stop making products like the inferior from over sea. Not good quality
5.0,"tested the SD card speed through the play store app, gets the speeds advertised and allows me to download more tv shows for my trips! perfect"
1.0,"I wish I could say this card was great. Been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64GB one (also SanDisk) which never gave me issues; sadly I lost it. This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn't recognize it. Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala. So that's $119 down the toilet. I have to buy a new one now, but I think I'll go for the new Samsung EVO ones (although they don't offer a 128GB model as of this writing - bummer)."
4.0,"I bought this for an old iPad2, which it fits perfectly. Here's what I like / dislike about the case...<br />PRO'S<br /> - As I said, its a good fit<br /> - It offers 2 separate incline positions<br /> - The magnet in the front cover wake the iPad without issue every time<br /> - I appreciate the look... clean, tidy, not too bulky<br />CON'S<br /> - It doesn't offer as much protection as I was hoping, especially for the corners and/or edges. If your kids will be using your iPad, this may not be the case for you.<br /> - To incline the iPad, the front cover of the case folds back and tucks into a little holder on the back cover. It tends to slide out of the holder at times.<br /> - The volume buttons are a little awkward to access when in the incline position.<br /><br />In summary, this is a decent product, with just a couple of small design flaws. Still it is well worth the small price tag, and at under $15, I would recommend to others."
2.0,Paint chips ez but they last for a while
4.0,"The battery is performing well after a few weeks of use in my 15&#34; 2009 Macbook Pro.  It fit exactly like the OEM, and its performance rivals the original.  The computer recognized it with no problem.  It had a cycle count of 0.<br /><br />I used iFixIt's installation guide.  The one problem was that the Pentalobe screwdriver that was included was not the correct size needed for this installation. (it was smaller, appeared to be a P2 rather than the necessary P6)  I had an iFixIt kit that had a P6 otherwise I would have been dead in the water with my laptop disassembled..."
3.0,"Not horrible but not what I expected based on all the 5 star reviews. I guess I should have noticed that there were only a handful of reviews...basically, kinda cheap with uneven colors from a china plant with poor quality control....but you get what you pay for hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 or 2."
4.0,I had hope for an easier keyboard for those of us who use excel for statistical data entry
5.0,I bought this for my phone because the apps I was using were filling up the little space on the phone I had.  I had never changed out the card on a phone before but it was surprisingly easy and now I have tons of room for all my photos and apps and stuff.
4.0,"Like other AmazonBasics items I have purched, this cable is solidly built, does its job, and is affordable."
1.0,Doesn't charge my devices!
2.0,"I had this installed and running fine for about 2 weeks and it just went dead one afternoon. So I contacted amazon and they immediately sent out a replacement. I installed the new replacement, but the drivers will not work this time. I went to ASUS website to download the driver also, and still didn't work. After 3 hours troubleshooting, I gave up and returned this card. It seems like this particular line does not have good quality control."
3.0,One out of 3 chargers received stopped working after the 3rd day. It kept saying the device does not support the connection and would not charge and got hot. But the other 2 work fine so far! They are long and look like good quality.
1.0,DO NOT BUY. Nothing but problems with this computer.
1.0,Did play in speaker loud enough.
4.0,This is an okay laptop screen guard. I was able to put it on nicely so I don't have any complaints. It's thickness is just right.
4.0,"Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy."
5.0,That's a lot of MP3s and photos. Works 100% with no issues with my 32GB Samsung Galaxy S III phone.
2.0,Disappointed now that the motherboard failed after about 2 months. .The initial symptoms were the screen going dark and unresponsive except for the status bar at the top of the screen.  Also the door holding the SD card doesn't stay secured so the card would unmount.
3.0,I purchased this product a few months back as a replacement for another 32GB Sandisk memory card that wasn't even a year old that ceased to work. After using this memory card for a few months I started having the same problem where the card randomly stops working or is not even recognized by my Galaxy S3 phone. I tried plugging it into my computer with the provided adapter and it seldom gets recognized. This card is not worth the money for it will not last. Buy PNY or any other brand. Sandisk has lost a customer.03/12/2013 - Amazon.com rocks! They refunded the full amount of the purchase! Kudos to them!
2.0,It keeps locking up. Has been very frustrating. Very disappointed thus far. I am consulting with Apple support.
1.0,"I bought this on October 9th and didn't start using it for about a week after I received it on the 11th. Well two days ago it died a quick death, I can't even format it! So after all these years of buying SanDisk products I guess I will give in and start paying a little more for Kingston it seems as though SanDisk is getting to be a cheaply built product. You would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first 90 days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned. Buy it right and buy it once so go with something else!"
1.0,"These things are absolutely not worth it. Bought this for my Canon EOS 100D and it failed within the first week! I was taking pictures normally and all of a sudden I get this message that the card could no longer be read. I insert it into my mac and the drive was not being mounted, I lost all my images for that day along with $20 in the garbage."
5.0,Awesome
3.0,This device is too wide to allow another USB device of any kind to plug in to the adjcent USB port.  I have also experienced occasional connection interruptions.
3.0,"Considering it is a very low cost tablet, it is adequate.  The battery life is horrible, or I would give it one additional star."
2.0,"While the build quality of the cable itself is good and it feels strong, the cable itself is not good for charging your phone. If you're looking for fast charging cables, definitely look somewhere else."
1.0,"Product not at all what was expected. Did not have &#34;Kuzy&#34; label anywhere, looked like a generic brand. The letters/numbers on keyboard were poorly printed and the colors were faded."
5.0,Got this tablet a month ago as a sample. I'm having a great experience with it. It has never lagged or such. Runs all my games smoothly.  I love the display and the graphics it gives. I love playing th games with the sexy controller. Definitely the best tablet I've used so far. I highly recommend it.
3.0,"If I buy this router  , do I have to pay Internet or something ?"
5.0,"I bought this 64GB card to use for photo storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The phone also recognized the card instantly. This is about the best deal for 64 gigs I have been able to find. If you have a music library (or in my case pictures library) that won't fit on your phone, this card is for you!"
2.0,It only lasted a few days.  It's still charging my computer but the connection that goes into the computer is very weak and chinzy.  I would not buy this again.
5.0,"I love this card. It provides a massive storage boost for my tablet, and has really fast access speeds. I have never run into loading problems, even with very large video files, and am happy with its performance."
5.0,Colors are as pictured.
2.0,Didn't work for me. Tried everything that was said and could get anything to clone. Would have given it one star but it does hold 2 hard drives and they do work. They just don't clone. Even had to buy a bigger hard drive because the clone has to be bigger then the drive being cloned. Don't waste you money. If you need to clone I think you have to spend a little more for the really good set ups.
4.0,I really like the kindle fire. The size is great since I'm only really using it for text book and internet. I do wish that I had access to the Android play store and google apps. That would have made this tablet a 5 star for me.
4.0,"I haven't had a chance to really test this product out to its highest potential. Yet, but it was worth the money. It wasn't hard to install. As a matter of fact it was quite simple. Read the instructions and you Shouldn't have any problems. The mechanisms are little awkward mounting to a motherboard, but once you get associated with exactly what's going on. It went simply awesome"
3.0,"Didn't fit into my GT 520 after its fan broke. Decided to test it out either way elsewhere, its a neat fan but it also suffered the fate of my GT 520's fan, the blades are really fragile making screwing it down a pain if not done carefully."
1.0,They don't fit the screen.
5.0,Compact size is helpful and the transfer speed is quite good.  Highly recommend this for people who have large storage requirements.
1.0,Do not work
1.0,Charger stopped working after charging twice.
5.0,Received promptly in envelope. Envelope inside which held plastic bag with clamshell. Card and adapter inside clamshell. I kept the clamshell for storage of other cards. I put this into my PALM TX PDA. YEP! Still use a PDA...works VERY well.
2.0,I expected this fan to be a little bit loud but it makes quite a bit of noise even at 25% speed. Moves a lot of air and works great on my budget build! Would recommend if you arent looking to spend $30 on Corsair AirSeries fans!
1.0,"I needed to replace my Kindle 1 charger.  The charger I got is not the right one even though this is the one I ordered.  It is &#34;female&#34; not &#34;male&#34; like the kindle charger was.  Also, this picture is deceiving.  I have the identical exact kindle than in the picture but the charger fits to the left of the kindle, not the right.  By this picture here the charger is being plugged into the volume button!  I'm not sure if I got the tip exchange charger by mistake, it seems that way, but the picture here doesn't make me feel any more confident about re-ordering it to see if I get the right one this time so I'll go for the universal cell phone charger that others recommended."
5.0,Great price and it's fast. Works well in my Note 3 using USB 3.0. I have movies shows and tons of music. I'm never bored anywhere I go.
2.0,"It's hard to find skins that fit so many different laptops. After trimming this one to the desired size, the corners tend to peel."
3.0,"The product arrived on time and it's working so far.  The charger is not good and gets overheated, and heats the computer so, I bought myself a new charger which is working properly now.  For a used computer, it is doing okay at the moment."
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
4.0,"Incredibly flat, works well, inexpensive, easy to route around baseboards, just kinda disappears... It's a winner."
4.0,"This mouse gets the job done. I like that it must go into some sort of &#34;sleep&#34; mode if I forget to turn it off, which is frequent. Saves battery life, which seems to be longer than I expected it to be."
4.0,"Sandisk* is simply one of the best SDHC & MicroSDHC memory card manufacturer's that I have used for a number of years.I have experienced Zero failures, and they are reusable over and over.Also their adapters are quite handy to carry when traveling or at the studio.*Would like to see SDHC cards in the 1 to 5 Terabtye in the near future."
4.0,good
5.0,We needed an option to increase the storage available in my wife's Nook Tablet and this serve the purpose perfectly. Just inserted it into the Micro SD slot and seconds later it was recognized.
4.0,works well and as described
1.0,DOA
4.0,"Great cpu cooler, bit of a pain to install"
1.0,Don't buy from from this seller under any circumstnces. The item will never work; it is counterfeit so Windows won't recognize it. People who are saying it worked or there is a fix are making bogus reviews. I spent a whole day downloading those supposedly fixes and they did not do anything other than render my laptop unstable. I both 2 of those from these bandits and none did not work.  And shame on them. I am giving then 1 star because I cannot give 0 or a negative value.
1.0,nice flashy lights. Avoid cleaning with isopropyl alcohol. even with 70% damaged cheap plastic underside of keycaps
1.0,"I bought the STX II 7.1 because I wanted a high-end product and the test results sounded promising. I installed the sister cards first on a system with Windows 10 (Z87X-UD3H - i7-4770K) after uninstalling the drivers for my old Creative Sound Blaster. I powered them as required (with a 4-pin Molex connection). I even dedicated separate PSU cable to the card. I downloaded the Beta software for Windows 10 (64 bit) from the Asus website since the CD in the package didn't provide support for Win 10. However, I got the message &#34;Can't find any device&#34;. I retried it several times  (also disabled the onboard audio) without success. I then tried it on a second system with Windows 8 (Gigabyte Z77X-D3H - latest Bios - and i5-3570k cpu @ 3.40GHz) to no avail. Always the same message although the device manager in both cases recognized the card. I finally tried it through the support of Asus in Israel where I am right now. But the only suggestion I got was that I should go see the vendor or wait for Microsoft updating the drivers. They added: &#34;you can contact Microsoft by phone.&#34; People who want to buy this card have to realize that although the test version of Windows 10 is out for more than 6 months, Asus offers only a Beta version where the driver is basically the same than the buggy version for Windows 8. It is hardly understandable that a company that produces good to excellent hardware provides such unbelievable dilettantish software and offers such a poor service. As long as they don't correct these flaws I wouldn't recommend to buy it."
3.0,I just bought it....but its asking for password... dose any1 know the pass word
4.0,Very good
5.0,Works great and exactly what I needed! The battery life is better than I expected even though it not a genuine apple battery! Recommend the product!
5.0,Perfect fit and looks professional! Fast delivery!
3.0,I started to have trouble with my card after about 3 months. I shall attempt to get a replacement and hopefully the new one lasts much longer.
5.0,This is a quality cable that is very flexible and just the right length for charging a phone in the car.
5.0,Using this on a Galaxy S III. Works just fine with stock TouchWiz and custom ROMs. Haven't had any corruptions or lost files. Purchased it once it hit the $50-$60 range and looks like it'll stay there for a while.
5.0,"This card is the fastest they make right now, the 32GB size is the upper limit that many phones and devices can handle like my Droid X phone.  I actually use it in my new Rikomagic mk802 III tv adapter and it works great."
2.0,The battery does not last long
4.0,good product
4.0,It's just a keyboard and it works as expected.
1.0,Doesn't work... Came all the way from china.. So I wont bother returning it
2.0,Didnt fit quite over my ipad mini
3.0,"This in OK headset, it will work for about six months, then the sound starts to get scratchy"
5.0,"I have used many memory devices from SanDisk, as well as a couple of Sansa MP3 players. This card lives up to my expectations. It works well in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I haven't bothered with the adapter, but I have no doubt it does its job. It is nice to have it just in case I need to read the card outside the phone."
3.0,This mouse is super easy to use and fits my hand well. The only complaint I have is the short(ish?) battery life - I've already had to replace my battery and I'm fairly good about turning it off when I'm not using it.
4.0,The SD slot on my laptop recognized this card immediately.  When I put it in my Droid Razr Maxx it recognized the proper amount but the phone required a reformat.Since install my phone has had some instability but I haven't had enough time to troubleshoot to determine whether or not it is due to the card.  Motorola says the phone can handle 32gig cards.  Some users have reported the 64gig works fine. Other users have reported problems with the 64gig card. Other than the phone instability the storage on the card seems to be working fine for now.
4.0,Good quality.
5.0,for me i prefer sandisk over other manufacturers. i have  come to trust in the quality and workmanship of their products.
3.0,did not hold the ipad on as securely as I hoped.  had to readjust a few times.  worked fine after we rigged it
2.0,Had this not even a year..screen keeps lcoking while I am typing n doin stuff....upsetting and disappointing
3.0,"I like the size and weight of the bag.  I use it 5 days a week and carry all my office gear easily. 13&#34; and 15&#34; laptop plus 1 power supply.  I like that there are 2 smaller pockets under the flap. I use those for a note book and pin, and umbrella.  The straps are easy to adjust.  My negative points are the 2 snaps failed in the last 30 days. (just short of having this bag for 1 yr).  When I say &#34;failed&#34; I mean they came lose and pulled out of the canvas cover flap.  So the 2 smaller pockets are not as secure."
1.0,These cables will not charge iPad mini. Tried using 2 different iPad's and 2 different charging cables.  Item does not work as advertised.
3.0,"Not a bad case for the price. Seems to be decently made and looks good.  I have two issues with it though.  One, the case covers too much of the screen making it a bit difficult to swipe the edge of the screen.  Two, the case also covers a bit too much of the power and volume buttons as well, making a bit difficult as well to get to the buttons.  I'd return it, but really not worth the time and effort."
1.0,They worked great for about three weeks now they don't work at all buy something else these are junk
3.0,It. Serves. It. Purpose.
1.0,I want my refund and it's ready to go back
4.0,"I bought a generic SD card for my Galaxy S5 and it corrupted all of my music. I am glad I have this SanDisk because it is faster at reading/writing and comes with the MemoryZone Backup app free, however, you need to have Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, or a similar cloud service. MemoryZone is great at backing up but lost some of my data when doing a transfer (phone to SD) :/"
1.0,"I almost forgot about this order, found it accidentally when searching my Amazon purchases, but I still remember the bitter lesson I learned - not to buy second hand computers anymore.<br />The computer I received turned out defective and very dirty, somehow I negotiated a replacement, which worked for just 3 months. The price I paid to Apple to fix was $1100.00:  they found the display was replaced with some third party display, the logic board was messed up, the upper case, the keyboard, the HDD, one ribbon cable, the super drive was not functional...just a computer piled from random parts. I paid the price and later I fixed more things to this computer, for instance Apple's labor turned out not perfect too, they did not assemble properly the new display which I fixed later myself.<br />This computer still works and I gave it two years ago to a friend who can not afford to get a new one.<br />At least I learned how to diagnose and fix macs."
4.0,Would not work in my Samsung Galaxt Tab 2 7.0 3G that I purchased it for.  But it does work fine in my Asus TF700. So I swapped the cards between them and everythings's OK.  First time I've seen this with a Sandisk product.
2.0,"No even close to iPad, but for reader it works fine."
1.0,"This key board is very cheaply made, though it looks like the apple one it is not of course and you can tell by the product that it was very cheaply made. When I got it 2 keys fell off within the first week. I do not us this product any more."
2.0,It did not work for me and I gave it to my daughter. It was not as wide<br />as I thought it should be.
2.0,"Works, but seems like the glue on the lightning connector end is failing (a week later).  Though it seems like that's not even necessary, just a plastic nameplate..."
5.0,"I recently purchased the excellent ASUS Chromebook Flip and since it only has two USB ports, I decided to switch to a Bluetooth mouse for this computer.  I was not able to absolutely confirm how well this Logitech M557 works with Chromebooks in general, but decided to purchase based on overall positive reviews for how the mouse operates.  I am happy to report that it works VERY well with the Chromebook Flip, and I assume, most other Chromebooks with Bluetooth.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Connects quickly and reliably.  I turn the mouse off to save the battery when I put it in my bag and it still connects in seconds when it is turned back on.<br />- Good quality feel and button response, typical of Logitech products.  Wheel works well, and the left and right tilt buttons perform back and forward on the Chromebook.<br />- The Windows button brings up the Chromebook search / launcher - happy surprise here<br />- Looks - The shiny metallic look of the mouse is very nice.<br />- Bluetooth range - tested up to about 36 feet with the Chromebook Flip<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Nothing to speak of.  Wish it came with a carrying case, but am using an older Logitech pouch that works perfectly well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice mouse to use with a Chromebook or any device, and I expect it will last for many years."
1.0,Modom did not last a whole year!! After 3 months it refused to connect to two different routers at different times. Don't waste your money.
4.0,"It's great!  I wish the delay in highlighting and typing notes weren't there, but otherwise it's great!"
4.0,"Fit of battery and performance is good.  Other replacement batteries I have purchased have not fit properly and would not charge.  When working at a desk, the oversized battery raises the back of the laptop to a nice angle for typing.  I assume that this also helps with ventilation.  However, on an HP DM-4, the oversized battery limits how far back the screen can rotate.  When working at a desk this is not a problem.  However, when working with the computer in my lap, the screen will not rotate as far back as I would like."
1.0,Wrong size.  The one that arrived is 28.2mm wide.  Width at the hinge points is 14.4mm.  Original Beats headband that I'm trying to replace is 25mm wide and 11.4mm at the hinge points (measured inside-to-inside).<br /><br />Be sure to check the width you need.  Beats headband sizes have apparently changed over time or between models.
1.0,"Every bad review was true but I hoped for the best. No matter how long you charge the battery, the charge will last 2-3 hours at best. I advise that no one should purchase this charger. There is 1 start because I could post the review without it. It is not worth 1 star."
3.0,"Headphones are great, software probably sucks.  I wouldn't know, because I couldn't get it to recognize the device (I'm a windows software developer myself).  Luckily, the headphones work with just plug-n-play."
5.0,I got these for a buddy of mine. he is having vision problems so he needed to be able to use the mic and hear his texts and emails. It works great for all his needs.
1.0,"Terrible, not compatible with iPad or iPhone."
2.0,small which I wanted but the communication to pc is scatchy
3.0,Great case
4.0,The speaker sounds great! The app stinks and for some reason I struggle with pairing two speakers
3.0,Good for the price
4.0,Fits hd7 perfectly
3.0,"Worked, but was not impressive."
2.0,"The front cover sewing was open, and the magnets slit out, the horizontal positions are not at comfortable angle they stand at almost 75° instead of a more comfortable 45°-60 °, although the looks are pretty nice"
1.0,"Pros- Set up is easy. price is cheap. it does a good job if yours isnt broken. automatically sets up the button map, and it has like the xbox 360 controller drivers (?) or whatever so its recognized as a 360 controller for any recent laptop games. I loved it at first because it is actually about as good feeling as a legit 360 controller<br /><br />Cons-<br />left joystick- theres this small area between up and right, where it causes your character to slowly walk, instead of run. It caused this on dark souls, and a naruto game, ONLY in this small area, so its probably the controller. I ended up adapting my playing to move the camera more so I don't accidentally start walking in the middle of a fight... so the fact I adapted my game play around this controller means its faults are severe. THIS CONTROLLER IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE.<br /><br />left shoulder button - about 20 days after receiving it, the left shoulder button broke so I quit using it. Today I look and I'm past my 30 day warranty by 2 days, so I took it apart and looked at the little 1/32 of an inch square box button thing and something INSIDE of this little button is broke, because the button has no resistance to it... like something inside of it collapsed? so the button needs replaced, and of course the button has 4 soldered prongs, and you need to remove the trigger assembly which has 3 more soldered prongs to even get to it.... so I guess<br /><br />so its basically unusable now, unless I want to commit suicide on dark souls by being unable to block...."
1.0,"Worked great in my galaxy s4 and died about 2 months later, what a waste of a lot of money!"
5.0,wasn't sure 64 gigs would work on my Galaxy S2It does work - and i am very pleased!Does the job!
4.0,This memory worked great in my HP Laptop.
2.0,"Very bad quality product. It's cheap plastic, with poorly designed interior dimentions for a CD/DVD drive which causes the disks to scrape on the top. It's not worth buying."
5.0,bought it for my Galaxy Note 10.1 and worked since day one. Easy to use in multiple devices for transferring files also.
1.0,I received it and used for just two day then It broke again!
4.0,worked a needed.
1.0,it didn't work and I returned this.
3.0,nice cover--not sure why the clear one slips
4.0,"Bought this for use in my phone to expand the memory in it. I have the 32GB GS3. I wanted to double the memory of my phone but I wasn't sure if my phone would take a 32GB card; it did and I'm happy with the product, I also loved the easy-open cardboard packaging. I like that it's easier to open and ship but mostly I like that it's not plastic since I hate the excess trash that puts in landfills."
3.0,"On first use of the charge adapter it would spark when plugging into the AC outlet. I tried several outlets. Very concerning, and I discontinued use immediately.<br />After notifying the seller they shipped me a new adapter the same day. It worked fine. It was unfortunate that the first adapter didn't work, and that I needed to wait for another, but I really appreciate that the seller addressed the issue immediately and shipped the replacement product same day. It's been some time since the purchase, but I'm pretty certain that they upgraded the shipping for me as well.<br />The seller made the best out of a bad situation.<br />I will buy from this seller again."
1.0,All three died after a couple of weeks
5.0,"Known brand, good packaging and working well in the phone.I wish the reviews did not require a set number of words."
2.0,"I was interested in learning about Chromebooks and I am very impressed with this Toshba Chromebook. It starts in 4 secs !! and surfing the net is really fast as well. Watching movies and U Tube clips on the beautiful screen are crystal clear, the Skullcandy speaker sound is also really good for a portable device and I find myself having to turn the volume down as it is quite loud at maximum volume, which is a welcome surprise. The only issue I have is that the defaylt font size is very small for my 67 year old eyes !! I have overcome this by setting the screen resolution to 150% and now I can read my Gmail E mails, goodle searches etc with no problem I would recommend this device as a great machine at a great price from Amazon delivered to me in mid July to Sydney Australia for the equvalent of AUD 400."
1.0,"I have purchased two of these cover/keyboards and both of them have broken at the hinge! Beware! They do not last as advertised and the company ignores attempts to make it right.  HAVIT claims a full 1 year warrantee but does not honor the claim.  I attempted to contact them and have never received a response.  Tried them twice, never again."
2.0,"I used this product with my Dell Venue 8 Pro.  After a couple months of use, it stopped letting me add new files or delete old ones.I tried reformatting and wiping the disk, but nothing worked.  Since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive, I assume I just got a bad one."
5.0,I bouth it in order to extend the capacity of this tablet (64 GB).Now I have 128 GB on my Asus transformer Infinity...
3.0,"The plug doesn't stay connected, but it does work.  I had to tape it to the desk so it doesn't move and become disconnected."
5.0,This went in a new Asus tablet with the latest android system in it. It read and was used with no issues.
2.0,"I have had issues getting this to work with my system. I am not sure what is going on, but it is slow and sluggish."
4.0,"Fits my macbook pro 13.3 with a little extra room, so it would slide around inside when i carry it. The charger case is also a little too small to fit my cables and charger, so you might need to play with the angle you're wrapping the charger in order to fit it in.  But overall it protects my laptop and does it job! Soft inner lining. Well done"
1.0,didn't work
5.0,Worked Well
5.0,"Personally bought this cpu for a gaming computer build that has been long overdue.<br /><br />Pros -<br />4 cores<br />Overclockable<br />More than enough for most gaming builds<br /><br />Cons -<br />Price<br /><br />After buying this and installing into my computer I have to say this thing is a beast compared to my old laptop (running a I7) after tinkering around with it I overclocked the cpu to 4.5ghz @ 1.258V stable. This cpu is great if you're looking for a upgrade and are still on the 1150 socket, otherwise i'd recommend spending the slight extra and getting the skylake cpus."
1.0,Lasted 3 months.  Nothing more to say other than Logitech is a waste or money.
4.0,"I made the move from onboard audio to a discrete card, mostly due to the fact that the audio I was experiencing was sub par.  I had gotten used to onboard audio, as my old audio card died some time back and it was easier just to connect the motherboard audio rather than get a new card.  However, I kept my eye on the industry.  When I finally decided on this card, it was from an informed perspective.<br /><br />The features in this card are more than enough for casual to hard-core gamers, and for low- to mid-range audiophiles.  High-end audiophiles will want the next card up, which comes with a discrete secondary card for additional functions and features.  This card produces excellent sound quality for the price, with crisp highs and deep lows.  Positional audio is also relatively good through headphones, though nothing beats a true 5.1 or 7.1 setup for positioning in gaming.<br />The Controller knob is probably not necessary.  I've got a pair of Sennheiser cans with built-in volume control, so the knob is redundant unless I want to switch between headphones and speakers, but I don't use a speaker setup.  I've also read some reviews of how the volume unit diminishes the quality of the sound as well, as is likely to happen anytime you have to go through more connections, so unless you truly need it ... don't bother.  Just tap right into the back of the card, and leave the controller in the box.  It might make a useful part for mods and customizations.<br />I have no drawbacks to complain about ... this card exceeds my (admittedly not terribly high) expectations, delivers great sound quality, and has worked from the get go.  DO REMEMBER to disable your onboard audio prior to installation, otherwise your software might not natively choose the correct audio output."
3.0,"Waterproof as advertised, but the metal ring rusted after 3 uses"
1.0,Would give this ZERO stars if I could. As others have said SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE and the smell rubs off on your hands. Likely toxic and certainly unpleasant. Not something I would use in any indoor space. Total garbage.
3.0,Love it ❤️
5.0,The card was fast enough for HD video recording with my Sony ActionCam as-15 and it is very durable. Great stuff
1.0,Did not have a power supply and did not work
3.0,I received this as a gift and use it weekly. I use several on-line libraries for content. Books from the library MUST go through Amazon. (weird) I am frustrated with the device and its requirement to link to the internet. Several word games require contact with the internet. This is not widely established as a policy/requirement from Amazon. I download all my content via USB. This degrades the usefulness of the device. I would recommend a different device because of this design or operational requirement. Perhaps Amazon will modify this in the future.
2.0,Good Product Bad Drivers
3.0,Love the design.. I feel the placement of the stylus is upside down. Works good though.
3.0,"It is good, but smells like smoke"
1.0,"Losing pictures, video, and tunes after 9 months on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (stock android).  Looks like this is a common problem.  I will try my luck with Sandisk on Monday.  If I don't get a replacement, I will never buy a Sandisk product again.  I paid the premium for ""Sandisk Quality.""  I am very disappointed.UPDATE:Sandisk will be providing a replacement SD CARD.  However, my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced.  SanDisk lost their ""premium rating"" in my eyes. It's going to take a while for them to get it back."
2.0,Memory became corrupt after trying to write a lot of files over!
2.0,mabey it's just the computer but connection is spotty and lots of interference.
1.0,"This product is advertised as compatible with any laptop, which is not true. Now I am stuck with a product that doesn't work because it's too expensive to send it back. I would expect a free replacement from the seller for one that actually works."
4.0,it worked
3.0,"The case looks great, however, it is not made exactly for this tablet. It covers a few important buttons (like the power button) and has a camera hole in a different place than the camera on the tablet. I'm not a fan of returning items due to shipping costs, so it will work for now. I guess there might have been a couple variations of this model..."
5.0,"They work great and I haven't had any issues with these cards.  I don't like using the adapters, but in a pinch I also used this in my Canon HS300 camera for 1080 video and photos with no issue.  They have very fast read/write speeds and have been quite reliable so far for me."
2.0,"Great laptop, but has some serious issues with sound drivers.  As soon as I booted it up and windows updates posted, my sound devices were constantly shutting off.  Since they were working intermittently, I suspected a software issue more than a hardware issue.  I spent quite a bit of time and effort on my own trying to find what was wrong researching it through the internet. Apparently the new drivers for soundcard (realtek) are very poorly written and can result in driver conflicts with other programs.  I also ended up returning the laptop after days of trial and error, but I finally found that if I uninstalled all sound devices and drivers, then let windows use an OLD driver, it worked.  If you see an option to &#34;roll back&#34; the sound driver to an older one, do that...it worked for me.  95% of people would have just given up and returned the computer...but I suspected I would have the same problem if I bought a new one.  Hopefully this helps other people out there if they run into the same problem.  The most disturbing issue?  It came from the factory infested with spyware and malware."
1.0,"I don't have time or space to outline all the problems with this piece of junk!  According to our contract, CenturyLink is to provide router. Will say CL have installed 3 in the last month--really 4 since the serviceman brought one new in box that would not even power up. Biggest nightmare is not only will it not stay connected, it will not reboot itself. so numerous times a week we are rebooting it. We have wireless security cameras in our house so when this piece of junk is off, so are they. And let's not even talk about Customer Service. They can't understand you and you sure can't understand them. But the biggest problem is that they LIE. Promises of different router, level 2 technician (whatever that is) and credit since we have not had internet service for half a month never comes to be.After a hour on phone (a weekly occurrence) last night and being switched to 3 different people, we got the &#34;expert&#34; that gave us a list of 4 other routers we could go buy that would work better! After researching, two are not compatible with CL system, one is for UK use  and one was $355. Centurylink's website has a long list of modern/router that can be used and not a one of these four were on the list. A JOKE!!!"
2.0,"I like the case, however it does NOT fit a NeuTab N10 as advertised (neither do the screen protectors that come as a special offer).  The case is too wide and the holes in the back do not line up.  Sad that I had to send it back, because it's cute & seemed to be made well.  It would get 5 stars if it fit my tablet that it advertised to fit."
1.0,"In the five months since I purchased it I have used it 3 or 4 times.  Last night I wanted to use it again but it needed recharging -the red light was flashing. I plugged it in and checked it regularly but after 12 hours it still won't turn on without being plugged in.  The battery won't charge up.  When it is plugged in it will intermittently pair up and work.  It is unusable, which makes it a very expensive paper weight if I divide its cost by the number of times it was usable."
5.0,There's not much to be said for this except that it works as advertised.  I'm happy with the purchase and would buy again.
2.0,"This case did not ship until 2 weeks after I purchased it. Love the color, but it is VERY difficult to put on without somewhat damaging your computer, which a complete paradox of what this product is supposed to do. Overall disappointing."
5.0,Nice to be able to stuff 20GB of music and movie files on my phone. And still have room to take lots of photos and video.
1.0,"Good E-reader before it stops working.  After a few month, my kindle had problem to connect to the Cloud to download booked I've already paid for. I spent more than 5 hours on 7 or 8 calls in addition to about 10 emails with the Kindle support team. The problem is still not resolved. And the kindle customer support never ever get back to me even after repeatedly promised to do so.  What made the whole experience beyond ridicule is that my credit card was charge by &#34;Amazon Services-Kindle&#34; for the the issue they've never fixed or care to fix."
3.0,o<br /><br />k
3.0,"handle started cracking and shell face shows a pink color when scratched. Not too go a quality, IMHO"
2.0,Not high quality as it was described to be.
3.0,Need extra deep box or open wall - connecting a HDMI cable on the back side to a standard box will not fit
2.0,Putting it on cracked my brand new laptop screen
3.0,"Pretty good, I like the color and the texture of the case. However some of the ink on the keyboard cover is gone."
1.0,Never got to use it. Install CD did not work
4.0,"After about a year, this screen protector is going on strong. Way easy to apply, and a friendly company that will send you another one if something is wrong with the product. If you have trouble applying screen protectors and need a while to align them, this is the one for you! The special fluid that is of no threat to your devices, give you plenty of time to apply it."
2.0,Fits keys good but does not allow my Macbook Air 11&#34; to fully close due to thickness.
1.0,"I tried to use the Surface with my 2 existing Dell screens having a DVI port.<br />Afterwards I found out the DVI Splitter Dongel does not work on a Microsoft surface Pro 3.<br />I switched my screens by Dell P2415Q screen using a Display port.  I connected the Surface docking with the DP input of the first screen (mini display port to display port and the output display port of the first screen to the DP input port of the second screen.<br />I still have a small problem.  The second display do not wakes up automatic, I have to push a button on the screen to wake it up.<br />Amazon refund the DVI splitter without any discussion."
4.0,"I bought this case because I wanted a laptop case that will protect my laptop from scrapes and bumps while still showing the beauty of the MacBook. The feel of it is soft and almost rubbery but smooth enough to slide into bags without getting caught. The case seems sturdy and made of good quality, including the rubber pad things at the bottom. The case adds minimal bulk but it does add some weight to the laptop, but nothing too major to worry about. The problem with it so far is that it's hard to take off and I have not been able to take it off yet because I am afraid I will either break the case or scratch my laptop. It comes with directions on how to put it on and take it off but it just won't budge. Maybe I'm being too gentle? Another thing I have noticed is that it leaves oily looking prints from your hands on the case, even though I use my laptop only when my hands are clean. The MacBook does this even without a case though so it doesn't matter to me. Most importantly, it fits perfectly!! It snapped right on. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
1.0,This is a piece of crap!!!  It constantly collapses and after only 2 months the 'contact paper cover' is peeling off and looks awful. For this price this should have held up better.  What a rip off!!!
3.0,Very unhappy there are a few apps that do not work with this tablet but work on other tablets not using lollipop.
3.0,It worked..
1.0,I ordered a iPad Air 2 but got a iPad Air...quality control is lacking...
2.0,"Worked great for about six months in my s4 and last week it started having device connectivity issues.  The phone keeps saying ad card removed, resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe 30 minutes.  Very frustrating.I have 30 gigs of media, I would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product"
4.0,I bought 3 of these. Great Price. All were new as described. SMART showed 0 hrs power on time and no faults.<br /><br />Why then 4 stars. Because you need to be aware that these are new old stock items. Manufacturing dates were between 2010 and 2011 so the WD warranty (2 years from date of manufacture) was expired on the drives I purchased.<br /><br />Overall am happy with these drives at this price. I will use them to clone C drives as backup on existing systems.
2.0,"I think that this product by itself is a great product.  However, not all devices is built for microSD XC.  And not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microSD with compatability to microSD XC.  This happened to me.  Since I just bought a new pad, I thought that it would be compatible.  However, it did not.  the microSD XC is formatted with exFAT so my device can detect the hardware but it can't write or read from it."
2.0,It's a nice cable modem but you CANNOT update the firmware without begging your internet provider to do it. I am forced to use Time Warner so you know that's not happening with their support.<br /><br /> It has a bad wireless disconnect bug which drops the network until you reset the modem.  That's been patched in a later firmware version which may or may not be standard on this device.
5.0,"bought it for my z10. now i have 6 seasons of tv soaps, over 1000 hi res pics, several short home vids and my entire music library with room to spare"
1.0,"i still own it but card went bad after 2 weeks of owning it, lost tons of music and data ect and lost all faith in sandisk products. i tried to get it replaced or money back but no return email from seller, so unhappy i lost over 20gigs of movies/music and data. wish there would have been a reply from seller or amazon but i still have a dead sdcard with all my files stuck on it."
2.0,"Drive works OK. However, it is very cumbersome in terms of pushing the connector out of the blue sheath. Need to return it."
2.0,No longer compatible with Comcast. Had to send it back.
4.0,good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does..
3.0,I love it
1.0,Does not fit amazon kindle.  Had to return it.
1.0,"This item is made so shabbily. On two of them, the plastic piece on top separated from the wire and the third said it &#34; this accessory may not be supported.  We bought it for an Iphone 5S.  Too bad."
3.0,"There were a lot of positive reviews for such a great price, but now I realize why it's inexpensive. It cuts out frequently - at least 3-4 times in one viewing session. It will disconnect from my wifi then reconnect, which isn't generally a problem unless I'm streaming Netflix; then it interrupts what I'm watching and I have to go back into my Netflix app on my phone and Chromecast it and restart the show. It's more annoying than anything else. I can deal with it for now, but it's inconvenient to say the least."
5.0,Hard to review this. It's an amazing little chip with huge capacity and it does what it's supposed to do. 5 stars.
3.0,"It's okay. I wanted an all shiny clear case and these have a matte frost part on about half of the back. Otherwise, everything works well. The buttons are easy to press. Easy to put on and take off but it's not loose."
3.0,It was just ok.
4.0,works well in my surveillance enclosures
4.0,Worked
2.0,Charge very slow compare to original charger.
1.0,"Don't waste your time or money.  Diminished range, numerous dropped connections, and had to keep entering the wireless password into all apple products over and over.<br /><br />First tech support call:  about an hour of troubleshooting and tier 1 support determined that the router must be defective so they shipped me another.<br /><br />2nd tech support call:  another hour of troubleshooting, consultation with tier 2 tech support to determine that my ONT equipment was not compatible with the quantum router.  Verizon scheduled a dispatch to replace my ONT.<br /><br />3rd tech support call:  new ONT installed.  Same issue as before.  Apple products (iPhone6, two iPad2 airs) only received about 25mbps downstream and about 2.7mbps upstream.  red and router was much faster with greater distance.  I also pay extra for 75Mbps down and up so really wanted to take advantage of the Verizon Quantum gateway hype.<br /><br />So I'm out $200, and the damn device makes a great door stop.  Never again Verizon, never again.  This kid is shopping around for a better service provider."
2.0,Returning it due to chip in the screen by the home button hole.
2.0,"BIG PROBLEM...<br />This product works wonders with Motorola Moto X 2013, Lollipop , but with an mini Ipad(model A1432), I have serious problems causes is hang OS (IOS 8.4.1 ) , sticks and then the computer restarts (It makes me feel nostalgic formy old windows, hehe), I 've done it<br />reinstalled Sandisk software and...nothing , still has problems ... I can not think about this trouble..., the problem will be the wireless flash memory or is the ipad mini? I hope that It will be corrected with the new IOS update in this September?....or simply it is not compatible with MAC ??<br />Summarizing very disappointed.<br />waiting for help or comments<br />goodbye from Chile"
3.0,It is good.
4.0,Well works just like any other SD card I don;t see ultra fast speeds or any thing. I shoved this guy into a Galaxy S4 and it works fine!
3.0,Does not hold (grip) Kindle like a previously purchased.
5.0,Good no problems works well.
2.0,"Like many others, I purchased this cable incorrectly because the seller neglected to show a photo of the input and most would assume it's the same type as the output Y-end. I'm sure it works fine for its intended use, but the picture is misleading"
3.0,"This cover has done the job, basically. However there has been some fraying with the stitching that I had to snip off. I've purchased cases like this for other devices and they all start to breakdown in some way or another, over time. The fact that it happened almost immediately with this one was a mild frustration but easily addressed. It's probably most likely that I simply got a bad one. It's basically a solid case."
1.0,wrong tiem
5.0,The case is beautiful and fits my iPad perfectly. The color is more of a light brown gold (which I was actually looking for a true gold) but other then that this is a great case and I love it.
3.0,"This is my daughters, and she says it is 'adequate'  ;)"
1.0,Prices are marked up to $399 and $499 for a $199 product.<br /><br />Ripoff
5.0,Love my memory card. The bigger the better for my phone. I put all kinds of music movies porn whatever on my memory card in a snap. Thank you.
3.0,"Failed after one month and the problem is epidemic on the sandisk forums , they slowly get corrupted then fail and report only 30-32mb size.The Lifetime warranty is nice, but these products are clearly defective , I'm in the process of RMA now, will update post on status updates.DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA WITH THIS PRODUCT, KEEP A BACKUP OF EVERYTHING YOU PUT ON IT, I'M 100% serious, just look at the sandisk 'users' forum for 64gb cards.Here is my breakdown while it lastedSanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1Write speed  was 8-10 Mb/s (usually 8, tested windows usb 3.0 reader, and android)Read speed 27 mb/sFAILED @ 1 1/2 monthsUpdate 2-13-14Received back replacement item in brand new condition readspeed is 40+mb/s write speed is still around 10-12mb/s - RMA turn around time was about 3 weeks, I will up rating if this one lasts longer then one month.Update 5-1-14RMA replacement is still going strong, upped the star rating by one point."
5.0,"I've never had a defective SanDisk SD card and this is no exception. They are well built and quality control is wonderful. I am especially sold on the 10 speed class and would highly recommend this for any type of media; books, movies, music, etc."
1.0,"I got this for my brand new Nokia Lumia 810, but there is some kind of problem, the card is horribly slow, I can't record HD video to it, it studders.  I've tried reformatting several times to no avail.  I didn't have any of these problems with my old 32gb class 4 sandisk card...  There are other people having this problem as well, seems hit or miss.  I can't recommend this card at this time for this reason.EDIT:  I've contacted SanDisk and they are RMAing the card.  I'll improve the rating if the new card corrects the problem.EDIT: Got the new card, problem still exists...EDIT: I've suffered with this card for a year now, the only problem is that I cannot take video without studders, so I figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem.  They have not.  I have used multiple different camera apps, and the problem still persists."
4.0,"So far so good, sort of.  First to note, I have had two previous versions of the Satellite with and Icore3 and one with an Icore5.  I have been very pleased with the previous versions of the computer.  My daughter still uses the Icore3 version from over 6 years ago and it works great.<br /><br />This model, although much lighter than previous versions, is a little sharp along the edges and the key board is not quite as nice, but still okay.  I did have one problem with the computer not being able to access the internet on the WiFi after I was on another network.  I couldn't figure out what the issue was so I went to the blogs to figure it out.  Seems the Network Adapter has some issue with Windows 10, possibly.  It got too techie for me, so I just reset my computer to when I received it.  I haven't had the problem since.  Not sure what happened.<br /><br />For the price it has been a very good deal."
2.0,"Keyboard no longer functions correctly after 5 months of use.  It's locked on to &#34;caps lock&#34; and some of the keys do not register.  It still lights up but not being able to type makes this keyboard useless.  However, the company flexbrains offered to send me a mouse of equal value it seems.  They don't have this keyboard in stock anymore for replacement so It was either I ship them the broken keyboard on my expense (they didn't offer shipping or anything so I assume it would've been on my expense) or they send me a new mouse.  My mother's mouse is broken so good timing, I went for the mouse. Hope it works well."
2.0,"Absolutely love the idea behind the Kindle for kids, just poor, poor execution.  Please give us parents of younger kids (mine are 3 and 5) a way to prevent our kids from downloading any and all apps.  From the moment I delete all of the apps they have touched throughout the day (which eventually locks up the device), it's loaded up again in minutes.  Deleting the apps isn't easy, either.  Sometimes they get stuck downloading, or just show an exclamation point or look downloaded but aren't.  Either way, they aren't easy to get rid of.  Amazon puts a password protection on the settings, just put the option to have one on the apps, too!"
2.0,"Just got mine in and will be returning. It's a good product, but I was under the impression it was one with a backing. Mine might also be defective. The backlit keyboard doesn't light up."
2.0,I could not get this mobo to obtain video. Tried all basic troubleshooting as well as some final advanced steps with no success. Tried a different motherboard from a different maker and pc booted up perfectly fine with no extra steps required. Dissapointed since I was looking forward to using this board.
5.0,"I used this upgraded card in my Razr Maxx HD and have been nothing but pleased with it. I haven't even come close to filling the entire card. I got it mostly because I keep my entire music library on my phone, about 5 gigs of music. It's a class 10 card so you won't see any lag in pulling up files. Great card for the price."
1.0,mine has already stopped working in less than 6 months.
2.0,"This will charge my iPhone sometimes, but not others. This will not charge and iPad."
3.0,"Decent sound, weird interface for setting up the balance of sound. The headset itself is very comfortable and decent weight. The software that came with the headset doesn't work well with Windows 10, however it seemed to work while I had Windows 7 installed. Would recommend for those not willing to spend anymore, but keep in mind that it has some strange interface / software quirks."
4.0,Cord a little shorter than original. Works fine.
5.0,Tons of storage and the read and write speed it an added bonus. Blows people away how quick my phone's ready to take the next pic.
1.0,It died in less than two years.
3.0,"I have several different brand and size tablets. Among them is the Galaxy II which I have been very pleased with other than the rathe short battery life. I purchased the Galaxy Tab 4 with great expectations thinking that it was going to be an even better tablet than my Galaxy2. Frankly I am very disappointed. The touch screen is very unresponsive and very frustrating. Samsung change the location of the Home, Back, and Screen buttons for some unknown reason and the location is very inconvenient. And lastly the modem does not perform as well as the one on the Galaxy 2."
4.0,"It Stand straight upright, keeps falling forward, should have been slightly slanted. Easy to carry."
5.0,I own both 64 and 32GB cards for use in my phone as well as GoPRO cameras. They have been reliable and worked well right out of the box with no problems. No complaints at all.
3.0,"Audio cuts out on occasion, seems like a connectivity problem with the bluetooth possibly. Other than that its just an ok headset, decent audio, comfortable for up to a few hours."
5.0,GOOD PRODUCTS
5.0,"It's perfect, the lid folds into a triangle that holds the note up perfectly, lightweight."
4.0,"Great product, my husband is happy with it. No issues at all. Delivery time was fine and they were easy to apply."
1.0,It's ok. Prefer the  HooToo 7 Port as it's a little cheaper and does the same thing. - Updated the review it died less than a year in service.
2.0,"It works as a mouse, but not a very good one:  the laser doesn't track motion well, the side buttons squeak when you click them, and you often have to click on a link more than once.to get it to work.  Microsoft didn't do well on this product."
2.0,"The memory would not work in my computer, but the vender promptly refunded my money."
5.0,"I am using this in a Samsung Series 7 developer build tablet to expand its hard drive capacity (only comes with 64gb SSD). It has worked great so far, and I have been able to install and run software from this SDHC."
3.0,My wife enjoyed it but it is quite large.
5.0,"Prefect size, easy to use buttons. Optional software to add shortcuts to buttons."
3.0,"It did work for my laptop, however the battery locking tab on the left side does not lock properly and the battery will fall out of the laptop."
2.0,"It's a stunning case, but if you look too sharply at it, you might break it.<br /><br />Retaining tabs are very weak on this case. Once put together, don't expect it disassemble it again. I owned this case for 4 months and took it around as an emulation platform when visiting family (what?!). Once the tab broke it lost its rigidity and I spent more time fidgeting with putting the sides together whenever I moved it around. Now it's making its grand voyage to the dump.<br /><br />If you want a permanent solution (read: to ensure you never disassemble it), use super glue on the tabs to keep them together. Otherwise if you plan on accessing the gpio pins, don't get this case."
4.0,"I received this portable charger by innogie for a product review and it is really cool. We used this portable charger on a road trip and found it to be super useful. The kids (all teens) absolutely loved that the top looks just like an alien when it is all lit up. I really like that this can work with so many different devices. Half out our road trip participants had iPhone and the other half had android. We were all able to use this charger for our phones. Not only did we use it for our phones, but we also used it for a variety of tablets and electronic readers. It takes less than an hour to completely charge the portable charger and then takes between 30 and 40 minutes to charge phones or devices on it, depending on the battery life when you plug it in to charge. My daughter and her friend used the charger to charge their devices while they played on it and it only delayed the charging slightly, but it still charged. This is a great item to have on hand. I like to use it when I know that I will be out of the house/car for long periods of time. It was perfect for our hike in the woods and mountains on our vacation."
3.0,"Did not fit my need of wanting a hot spot closer to my primary computer, but appeared to be made well and installation ease was moderate."
5.0,I bought this to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it works great.  Transfer speed is excellent and it is completely plug-and-play compatible with my device.
2.0,"1) There is no CAPS LOCK light so I have no idea when CAPS LOCK is on or off, this is especially annoying when typing in a psaaword and getting multiple fails attempting to log on to anything.<br /><br />2) Number pad does not work, it is software driven, not hardware driven so if you are using Linux you do not have a working number pad.<br /><br />3) The SSD is not an SSD, Linux would not install on it because it was not an SSD it was two SSD's that were in RAID. I only learned of this after they had been removed and replaced by a single SSD. If I had know they were in RAID I would have simply removed the RAID and had two SSD's.<br /><br />4) Keyboard back lighting cannot be turned off or adjusted, sometimes it is hard to see my keyboard because it is too bright.<br /><br />I do like the large display and the general look of the unit though."
2.0,didn't work for my Kindle fire
4.0,"Short simple and sweet, this is an enjoyable device to use. This runs windows 10 beautifully. If you do run windows 10, make sure you download the drivers of of Asus website for the T100TAM.<br /><br />Supports stylus but will lag with drawing applications that Ive tested. Battery life is really really really good.<br /><br />The only downside is that it smudges easily, and browsing PDF files in portrait mode doesnt scale to screen. (using adobe reader )<br />Overall, great device, and a lot of bang for the price."
5.0,"I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I've used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It's cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it's size, so long as your device supports it."
1.0,"I got it as a gift.  When I put into my computer, my anti virus software immediately found viruses, 2 of them to be exact on the drive!  : (  My friend said that he bought it on Amazon, so I came and tried to read the reviews.  Now I don't know if I dare to actually use it!"
2.0,The power button is difficult to push to turn on . You have to poke it with a flat screw driver
5.0,I lost a screw in my MBP when I had to open it up to fix a problem I was having.  These screws fit perfectly and it was cheaper to buy the three pack than a lot of single sets I've seen online.  The package also included a free Velcro cable tie.
2.0,"Other cards of this style (&#34;EVO&#34;, but not &#34;Samsung&#34;) have proven to be fake capacity, especially when offered at 50% below the market price for real memory. Check the reviews for other generic mid- to high-capacity SD cards that are similarly low-priced..You will see a pattern of cards that seem to work at first, but eventually suffer significant data loss.<br /><br />*** YOUR DATA IS AT RISK ***<br /><br />Beware of fake capacity SD memory cards. This and many other cheap, apparently-high-capacity SD memory cards are often low capacity 8GB or 16GB cards that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. These cards are then redistributed by many clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />Such cards will show their false capacity both in your phone, your camera and in Windows properties, and they will even work normally under low usage.  However, once their true (low) capacity is exceeded, they will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data. Files will look okay in their folders, but will be corrupt when viewed, played, or otherwise read back.  Your photos, videos, music, contact list, and other data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />There are lots of good 64GB SD cards are out there. Expect to pay roughly $25 and up for 64GB (as of Q3 2015) and at least twice that for 128GB cards. Expect only a very slight price difference between brand name and generic drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced card, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the card with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase of this test usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient to weed out the fakes.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.also test by filling the card up to at least 30% with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back.

3.0,"At first this microphone seemed to work great. My friends could hear me just fine while gaming and skyping. However; after a month or so of use my friends stared complaining to me about static on the line and sudden increases and decreases in the microphone sensitivity. Usually that was rectified by simply unplugging and plugging the mic back in. After a while though the problem not only persisted but became worse, until one day my friend an I were playing Dota 2 together and he said my mic sensitivity suddenly became extremely and deafeningly loud. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and could never get it to work again after that. It was officially dead.<br /><br />pros: great price. very sleek and easy to use. Fits almost anywhere on my desktop without being in the way. Also has a 9 foot cord which can be extremely convenient if you need to finagle and snake it around your desk for positioning and it can be easily coiled up when not needed.<br /><br />cons: moderate sound quality and it died too quickly"
1.0,"Dust cover was tiny, not disclosed in the description. The dust cover could not fit a tower CPU. Instead it looked like it would fit those old outdated CPUs used in the 90s. I do not recommend this item. It's misrepresented!"
2.0,"Arrived late, but the real problem is that they don't work on my iPad Air.  They seem to work fine on the iPhone 6's, but not the iPad.  I tried the original block, and 2 others."
4.0,"Plays real good, not as loud as I thought but does the job"
1.0,"I gave this one star but it really is my fault because I thought this was for my iPad Air 1.  But all in all, it is a nice case."
1.0,"cannot hold much memory at all! i had a total of 10 games on there,no photos or videos and it was at full capasity. wish i would of known that before i purchased the product."
5.0,Has worked perfectly since the day I got it. No hassles or problems so far. Holds everything that I would ever want to store on it.
4.0,"Works like it should. Used it to make a recovery disk for my PC, no problems at all."
5.0,Exact replacement works like it is supposed to.
1.0,This is an inexpensive product that stopped working at just about 30 days after purchase.  Amazon says I am not eligible to return the product or even exchange it past 30 days.
5.0,Works well for the Galaxy S3 and provides additional space for pictures and music. It was exactly what I expected it to be.
2.0,good morning I need to validate the tracking number that purchased the 28de January of this year
3.0,"Got this quickly to replace my old headset that died. I like it, it's good quality, but you need to plug in the USB and both plugs, kinda confused as to why they have the USB on it if I still need to plug in the microphone and headphone jacks  Update: Well after 3 e-mails and 2 calls at 10pm at night from the company telling me what the USB is for and telling me to give them a 5 star rating, I will not change the rating simply because I feel a bit harassed. The USB is to light up the headphones, wow, so amazing."
5.0,"Bought this by accident for my Samsung Galaxy s3 but the phone reads it and accepts all 64 gb so I am a happy camper. Worked the first time so I bought one more for my Galaxy Tab 2. Again, no problems! Awesome card!"
1.0,Mouse wouldn't even work with this mouse pad.
1.0,"wrong part, does not fit, its not the same one as the picture, close but not the same.<br />just last 3 days of not able to use my laptop at work... no good!"
4.0,"I would like to give 5, but only adapter is bad on this. with adapter data transfer rate is very slow. That's why i gave less rating."
5.0,"I upgraded a generic, small micro sd card I had on hand and was using in my GS4.  This card is very fast making for seamless read and write of pictures, video and playback of music stored on the SD card.  It works great which is exactly what I have come to expect from all SanDisk products."
4.0,"the extra room on my phone is great but ive noticed since installing it that its a lil slow when transferring files from my phone to the card, its not like im sitting there forever but its a noticeable difference between my old card and this one"
5.0,"hard to find memory.  Overpriced bc of its lack of availability, but did the trick!"
1.0,Works only occasionally.
3.0,Does it's job and fairly cheap for what it's worth. I had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective. Sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products. The second one works perfectly fine. I use it for my GoPro camera.
4.0,"Not bad overall the stickers were good , some were not PC or for younger children so adults may need to filter some of them are adult orientated.<br />."
4.0,"Super cool organizing gadget. The smaller straps are nice and stiff and the rubber tread grips well. The larger straps are definitely only good for larger items as they have more give in the tension. It has no problem holding something as small as an ink pen or as heavy as my iPhone.<br /><br />This one is about as wide and slightly longer than a standard magazine (think Cosmo or Popular Science). The backing is quite solid but it feels as if their are two pieces (or maybe mine just got bent in shipment?) so it has a bit of a curve where it naturally flexes in the middle. Not a big curve, but enough that it doesn't feel as substantially solid as the smaller versions.<br /><br />The pocket is small and won't hold much over a granola bar. Best used for documents maybe? I have a hard time imagining what I might put in there. The little hanging strap is a nice touch, though I can't see when or why I might want to hang it. Still, always nice to have the option!"
1.0,"Worked for 2 days and then the center of the phone plug turned black like it burned itself up.  Also, according to my Apple dealer who tested it, this was NOT an &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; item despite the headlines saying such."
5.0,"This is just what the tablet needs, it increases the memory up to nearly 100 GB so I will bnever run out of storage space."
2.0,I matched my serial number up with the one that said fit but bottom pice did not fit.
3.0,"The fan is very handly and fine, but the fan speed is very low, just for a little wind."
5.0,"Works! And why should I write more..... damn it! Eleven more words... finally am done with this, CRAP!! THREE MORE WORDS??"
5.0,"Wow! Fast memory card. I bought this for my new GoPro Hero 3. Great performance for full HD video.Shipping was fast, and nice communication on shipping and estimated arrival time.The SD Card adaptor works perfect in my full sized SD reader built in my laptop.Transfer speeds were blazing and read speeds are amazing.SanDisk is the best, really worth buy the top end class 10 micro SD card.If you doing HD video this is the card for you. Video is demanding, so youneed a SD Card that can keep up.In Hawaii we play hard, and the GoPro and SanDisk card have been working flawless at full 1080p60 video."
1.0,"My card got so hot it almost melted. Crazy! But you card somewhere else, I know I Wii! I'm not taking the chance of ruining one of my devices. No thanks"
4.0,Upgrading from my old Netgear adapter to this model gave me a 1 to 2 bar improvement in my wifi signal and I love the ability to position it anywhere on my work desk. Thumbs up!
5.0,"This is my first SanDisk card, I have a bunch of other brands.  I use this one in a tablet.  It works great!  Really love the lifetime warranty that's included. So far so good!"
3.0,Works. a bit &#34;flimsy&#34;
2.0,batterie did not hold a charge longer than 30m but was cheap
2.0,"I want to love this keyboard. The touch is just right, the keys are satisfying, and the board offers some sound but is not clicky-clacky. Unfortunately there are some shortcomings. They omitted the Windows Menu key (not the Windows button, that's there). I use the menu key heavily and without it I have to continually move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse. A real productivity stopper.<br /><br />Also, to use the Home/End functions (more keys I use heavily) you have to push a secondary Fn key. I would have been fine had they added a skosh more length on the keyboard to include a few more keys.<br /><br />I want to love this keyboard, but I cannot."
5.0,"Excelent product, excelent price"
4.0,"This is a basic case, that get the job done at a low price. As long as you are not expecting any frills, it's great!"
1.0,Ipad does not stay in the hinge portion when closing.
2.0,"Sound isn't top quality, but what would you expect for 10 bucks? I have to buy another set to replace these as the microphone sound quality is horrible in Teamspeak. People tell me my voice now sounds metallic, garbled and fades in and out - and the headset is brand new. The ear pieces can be uncomfortable on the ears, kinda stiff and they don't flex at all to sit properly on the ear - instead the edges jab your ear."
2.0,I need to remember that you get what you pay for.
1.0,06.NOV.2012 - Bought the card.12.JAN.2014 - Card failed.It cannot be formatted or used in any way.It lasted 14 months and most of that time I was not even using it.
4.0,So far so good!
3.0,"I love the PC, worked like a dream for the first couple months, but then I made he mistake of upgrading to windows 10, it gave me the black screen of death and I still not have been able to fix it."
4.0,Solid but limited life.  Second one in two years.
1.0,"Very disappointed. The WiFi card had issues. The signal was so weak I had to stand next to the router to use it and even then I barely have one bar. I called dell support and have been on the phone for over an hour. The technical support agents tried updating drivers and the bios but no help. I am extremely disappointed in this product and do not recommend it. Others seems to have no problems so maybe it is hit or miss, but when you miss it is terrible and not worth the risk."
2.0,"This product was a waste of money. It's slow in opening apps and it always say....  apps have stopped working or not responding...tried rebooting and resetting, uninstalling and reinstalling apps, work well for a few days, then start back acting up. I would not recommend this tablet to anyone!"
4.0,"Bought two, one for me and one for my husband.  Works great.  Feels good to have a lot of space on my smart phone to save pictures, movies taken, etc."
4.0,Works great for the month I have had it in my Galaxy S3.  I purchased this to go in my Samsung Galaxy S 3 and was super excited I didn't need to buck up more money for the 32GB phone.  Well *dumb* me did not know the the SG3 does not allow apps to be moved to an external SD card.  I thouhgt I had researched everything but I missed that.  The card works fin and I can store umpteen thousand pictures not that I have figured out how and I might even be able to figure out how to put a movie onto it but what a waste of a GREAT SD card.Pro: Top of the line cardCon: SSG3 and most new smartphones won't allow apps to sd even with the micro sd card option on the phone
5.0,Works great and arrived a day early!
1.0,The magnet is not strong enough to stick on the gas tank.
2.0,one of the wire connectors does not work at all
1.0,"1. There is nothing as LQM®. It is the same &#34; SIKER®New Replacement battery for Dell Inspiron 14R (5421, 5437) ,Inspiron 15R (3521) ,Inspiron 17R (5521, 5537) ,Compatible P/N: MR90Y, N121Y, G35K4, MK1R0, YGMTN [6cell, 65WH]--18 months warranty.&#34; It is the same company, and they are just trying to sell through another name. Maybe because the bad reviews.<br />2. The Battery does not fit properly in its slot and falls down when laptop lifted up.<br />3. Bad packaging. Even the final bubble case was already opened.<br />4. Finally, sent back for a refund."
1.0,I bought this keyboard and mouse combination thinking that it will help me because of the ergonomic design. It turned out to be a waste of money. The mouse is too heavy - and it added extra stress to my right hand. the keyboard was not that helping either. settled down for the cheap default keyboard.
1.0,It looks impressive but it only worked for a couple of weeks
3.0,I got mine 2 weeks ago and it's working fine for me. Not sure if it's or not original but certainly the cable it's much thinner than the original one. So I doubt it's an Apple product and it looks like I will have to be extra careful when I carry it.
5.0,Great product. Fit perfectly on my 2011 MacBook Pro 13.3&#34; display. The blue is the exact color you see.
1.0,"Power button is cheap, broke within a week and we could not fix it. My daughter was upset. Wish we had spent the money and got a good tablet."
5.0,"Good quality, Great price, Fast shipping."
2.0,"device didn't work with Mac USB3. I think , I just got unlucky with defective device."
1.0,"I thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews.  But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product.  My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems.  I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times.  So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.""You get what you pay for"" may be applicable here.  But a lot of others did have success with this card.  So YMMV."
3.0,Does not give you the protection you really need but does help a little
4.0,"Not much to say here. If you need a solid phone stand that can fit in your pocket, you won't find anything much better than this."
5.0,"The disk keeps up with the data input, it's neat and compact, it responds to the computer readily. I really like it. Might get another one and I'd recommend it to a friend anytime."
4.0,Love this lap desk. It suits my needs so I use it most of the time.  I just wish the space inside was slightly deeper so I could use it with a tablet protector of some type.  Also I find the latching mechanism to be nearly impossible and need either a table knife or my husband to open it.
5.0,"This is fantastic, its fast and bundle of space.I have been using this for 2 years already and still going strong. I store all my pictures and video on here taken by my phones.This is a must buy for your phone!"
1.0,"Latching mechanism is Junk, broke of in a few months of little use."
3.0,"The fan itself works fine, but I'll be honest with you the bottom part that holds it on broke after a week. I had to glue the stainless steel plate to the bottom of the unit itself."
2.0,I have had to tape the back because it is loose and ends up popping out the plug ins. I guess you get what you pay for. :(
2.0,"after a while of using this case, i realized that it did more damage than good. the top part is great, but the bottom one is not. I noticed this case has left permanent stains on the bottom of my laptop. I would not recommend this product to someone who plans on using it for over 2 months."
4.0,"I probably would give it more stars, but It's my first one and I'm still trying to learn haw to use it."
4.0,"This was bought for our 7yr old. His class uses an online program for schoolwork. This is his second tablet as he destroyed his first one last year. So far it's held up really well. It's kept in a leather folio case. He did already break the charger by bending it. It's easy for him to use & processes quickly. It's not as overloaded with junk as some tablets. It is thin & very lightweight. Overall, a great affordable option."
3.0,"Id like to say, There isnt as much treble as i'd like. The bass is more than enough and even though you can control the bass input with the knob I find it very difficult to find a nice adjustment on them. The desk speakers were a let down though. There's too much mid coming through and not enough high."
1.0,Was broken when it arrived!
1.0,well i used a lot just for gaming so the batteries died so i changed them and now its unresponsive the red light flashes to movement but its not doing anything onscreen DON'T BUY IT OR NEVER CHANGE THE BATTERIES
1.0,Does not fit Fire HD 7! The cutout for camera & side volume controls does not line up.
1.0,I bought the Sandisk Ultra 32gb card for use in my Samsung smart phone.  Worked great for about 3 months.  Now the phone won't recognize the card & neither will my computer.  Just went unreadable one day.  Very disappointed in the reliability of this card.  Will contact Sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty.  Shall see if they'll stand behind their product.
3.0,"I liked my Tab 3 a little bit better.  But the Samsung customer service was the most ridiculous experience of my life.  I never thought any company could have worse customer service than Apple, I was wrong.  Which is very unfortunate, because I likely will never purchase a Samsung again, time to start looking elsewhere.  But as far as this particular unit goes, it works, I'm glad I didn't buy it brand new.  Seller was supportive.  I just question my future with Samsung products in general."
5.0,Great
5.0,"I bought two of these for my laptop and my camera and they're working great so far, good speed. 100% happy with this purchase."
4.0,My only real complaint is that it's a touch smaller than I would like; it's not quite big enough to fit standard sized paper documents; but suitable for letters.
2.0,"Case is perfectly fine for the price I paid. However, the keyboard is terrible. I have to push at least three times for a R to appear and if I press once, I get two o's. I would recommend spending more and getting a better keyboard as this one was not worth the money."
3.0,"There is a lot of plastic in this build, it feels cheap, the controls are great, but I was not very happy with the lack of mounting options. Its not bad though."
1.0,Didn't fit my 13&#34; MacBook Pro.
4.0,"Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but I don't really stress these kinds of things.  I have had no problems.  Have not checked it for heat or any such thing."
1.0,No windows 10 compatibility. Lack of response from Dell.
1.0,"It does not work for my Mac Book Pro.  The plug is too small.  I bought this as a backup to the power cord that came with the new laptop and I just discovered that the plug was not compatible today, but I cannot return it due to Amazon policy.  I feel cheated as this was suppose to be compatible with my new Apple laptop and it is definitely not.  Buyer beware!"
3.0,"A few things were missing from the kit when I ordered this. However, everything that came in was in good condition."
3.0,"Great but I had to return it - first Olympus.com gave me wrong information and my 13 yr old camera could not handle 512MB and secondly, I received a new camera for my birthday and it would not accept the Olympus memory card so I returned it."
5.0,"For me, this is the best Chromebook for the money you can buy. The display is amazing, the sound is loud and clear. The keyboard is the only weak spot as the keys stick occasionally and it isn't backlit."
2.0,"The case itself is fairly nice in terms of color and texture(very smooth) However, after 3 months you can expect some of the rubber bumpers on the bottom half to fall off especially if you carry your mac around all day or move it around a lot."
5.0,i don't really know what to say - accept that it does the job - i use it with my SOny Action Cam - and so far so good - :)
2.0,"This isn't really a case; it's just several slices of lucite held together with *plastic* screws.  It doesn't fit well and the plastic has a strange, greasy film on it."
2.0,"Its a nice case for a very cheap price, however, it says it fits 7 inch tablets, it was too small for mine."
1.0,Followed battery instructions and after one month will only charge to 74%.  Would like a replacement if possible to see if it is only this specific battery.
2.0,Worked well for about 3 weeks and then it broke. Very very cheap device... Highly recommend getting something else.
2.0,"Slips all over the place. Sorry. Great idea, but I have to wet it daily to keep it from sliding."
2.0,This case did not fit my iPad Air .. I had to melt one of the corners to make it for the piece was too curved on the inside to let the corner of my iPad to fit ! Outerbox is way better !! And much better quality !
4.0,Just finished pulling 4000 ft of this cable through new construction and didn't have any issues.  I would recommend that as you get closer to the end of the spool you will want to unroll the length of cable you need and stretch it out.  This will help keep the cable from kinking.  This is common sense with almost any ethernet vendor.  I would purchase this again.
3.0,"I use it for my galaxy s4 and this card crashed on me few times, i lost all my photos and music. Thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is, the card completely stopped working at one point. I had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle."
1.0,"I would not waste your money. I can't keep it connected.  I am sitting less than 2 feet from the tower where the receiver is plugged in and it shuts off constantly. Sometimes it won't even connect.  If Wacom wants to do something, they should just make the cable that connects the tablet to the PC longer.  Their wireless accessory kit sucks.  What's worse, is I've researched the internet for a fix, and I've had absolutely no luck.  I purchased this in May and wasn't able to get around to installing / playing with it until sometime in July and am therefore probably going to be stuck with it and just out the money.  UPDATE: I have had no luck updating drivers or getting this to connect and stay connected. This kit is junk.  Don't waste your money, not until Wacom actually gets it to work and stay working."
1.0,"A total waste of money must be from china, bubbles very hard to remove and this can scratch very easy."
4.0,"Works good with Netgear R7000 router, reaches advertised speed.<br />It's not necessarily a micro size because it does sticks out a bit. I think it's necessary for it to stick out a little to get good wireless reception. One draw back is that it does get quite hot to the touch. I just don't touch it and let it be, it continues to work even being really hot."
5.0,"I'm still stuck 10 years ago when microSD cards were fairly new. They were and still are neat - its amazing at how much you can put on something that is literally the size of a fingernail! I purchased this Class 10 64Gig exclusively for use with myGoPro HERO3: Black Editionso that the card can keep up when the camera is recording HD at 60fps. Its amazing how many people aren't aware of the classes of these data cards and how it can affect performance and capturing of video and even stills. If you have tried capturing video only for it to shut off automatically, it may be because your memory isn't fast enough to keep up. But you'll have no problems keeping up with this card nor should you have problems storing it all! This SanDisk memory often gets labeled ""the best of the cheap memory"" but I'm unsure how the expensive, poor memory does - why would anyone buy anything else more expensive?! This is the card to get! It's so good, I've also purchase two 32Gig cards for our Samsung S4's!"
1.0,Received broken returned for different brand.
4.0,"The cable appeared to be well made with quality materials. The connectors securely attached to the hard drive and the motherboard. My desktop's chassis has very tight quarters for the hard drives, so the 90-degree connector worked great for that tight space."
4.0,"The bag looks nice and professional, it also holds a lot along with the laptop."
3.0,is that really touch screen ???
2.0,"i like it because i don't have to worry about updates/crashing on a daily basis.  But i didn't realize at the time this is wi fi ,  it doesn't do anything unless you are connected to the wifi.  there may be a way (offline) but  hasn't worked for me yet.<br />the camera crashes all of the time.<br />but it is quick to start up .  i do love it but i just havent had time to learn all the ins and outs of chromebook."
5.0,"I purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone, specifically the Galaxy S3.  It performs absolutely flawlessly.  If you have any reservations about this micrSD...don't. There's no need to format since it comes pre formatted. Should you desire to format,  do it from within the phones settings and again, no issues.  PLEASE, turn the phone off and remove the battery before installation...lol"
4.0,"The keyboard came and is missing the &#34;bluetooth connect&#34; button needed to pair it to my computer. I put batteries in it and the power light comes on, but my computer can never locate the keyboard.  *****edit****  The company contacted me and helped me get the keyboard working (thank you).   It's a good little keyboard for the price. About the size as an apple bluetooth keyboard, but a little cheaper feeling. No complaints though for the cost."
3.0,Ok sound
5.0,It's hard to believe how affordable digital has become. 32 GB in a device one quarter the sie of postage stamp would have been science fiction less than a generation ago.I picked this up for portable music when I didn't want to schlep (or risk) a phone or iPod. Works great with all SD card readers.Select with confidence.
3.0,Good for the money I paid.
3.0,"disappointing, purchased brand new and when received the back space button would not work. I had to send it back. not yet sure on turn around time."
3.0,Nothing special. Just enough to hold the tablet!
2.0,"Item did not fit properly, and the code on the item was different then what is advertised. Besides these issues the product works and fixed the issue with my mac"
5.0,This sd card is perfect for my phone. It is the right size and especially the right price. After looking all over Amazon price for this card was almost $10 lower than everyone else's.
4.0,Excellent product fast enough because if you need something to put on your keychain then speed is necessary but not important. I just carry the documents that I need for class and work. I only wish it had a password protection feature like SanDisk.
1.0,I HEAT IT
2.0,Shipping took a while but disappointed that i received the wrong product..after waiting for so long
4.0,"Even though the point resolution is not that great, everything else works fine."
3.0,"Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising."
1.0,This review is for TabletExpress! They are selling defective junk. I ordered this Dragon touch for my 8 yo son with Autism and the first one we got never held a charge. This caused my son to have a 2 hour meltdown. I packaged it up and sent it back for a replacement. The replacement lasted 12 hours. It totally froze in the on position and once again completely blew out my son. And once again I have to return it to get my refund to buy from another seller.  The reviews on the Dragon Touch are great so I will order one but not from TabletExpress!! They are horrible!!
4.0,"Product works great.  My son no longer drives me nuts with constant clicking in the back seat of the car.  Service is great too.  Dongle had a problem and they had a new one on my doorstep in 4 days, no charge.  Too soon to speak about longevity."
3.0,"Super cool to be able to watch my over the air programming on my xbox one.  The guides are clean and responsive but directly changing channels is a bit slow.  I had my antenna connected to my Sony TV prior to buying this and it worked great as far as reception goes.  The Hauppauge Tuner does work mostly well.  However I lost about 4 or 5 channels that work perfectly on my Sony TV.  If you have really high signal strengths in your area you should be good if you are in an area where its a bit weaker you might not be happy.  My biggest complaint is I spent about an hour trying to troubleshoot why it wasn't working out of the box, xbox simply wouldn't see it, it would only light up for a few seconds at a time.. Turns out the USB extension cable was bad, even my laptop wouldn't recognize the device, swapped out the extension with one of my own and it works without issue.<br /><br />This was an experiment to try and centralize how I was accessing all my content.  But now I'm starting to feel I may have to go back to my TV since the signal quality is so poor now.  I'm a bit bummed..."
3.0,"It is a great product but the color is totaly different at what it is shown in the picture.  I chose the color because it would be the same as the mouse, the mouse pad.  But definitelly there is no complain about the quality."
4.0,"the Pi is fantastic, I recommend it to anyone interested in things of that sort. The case functions. I'm sure there are better cases out there. The reason I gave 4 stars not 5, is the WI-FI dongle doesn;t work that well. I know its not going to be as powerful as my laptop or phone but sometimes it will loose signal 2 feet from my router. There are better ones available, but considering the price for the whole package it's not that big of a deal."
3.0,"Loved the tablets they were a little hard to set up and will be fine for teenagers who are more tech savvy but not so much for an older person, although they fit nicely in your purse and the pictures was clear it was hard to get the programs to get to work properly.  The case colors were nice and they charged easily.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way."
5.0,"For its type (specifically, a soft case), it is a very good case. It's high-quality, and I am very satisfied with it. It's got these raised bumps of fabric in it to help cushion it more, and the zippers don't get stuck. Of course, a hard case is probably better protection for a laptop on the go, but as I am careful with mine (read: I have not smashed it to smithereens yet), this case suits my needs. It feels durable, and I will be sad the day I gget a different-sized laptop."
2.0,This charger didn't last long for me.  The cord pulled away from the box in the middle and was showing bare wire underneath.  I hadn't noticed this and it sparked and burnt my hardwood floor.  You get what you pay for.  I ended up having to go ahead and buy the actual Dell power adapter and it has held up much better.  I would recommend just biting the bullet and paying the extra for the Dell brand. This power adapter would probably work fine if you never move your laptop around much and never plan to roll the cord up or move it much.
5.0,"This was a great little memory card for using with my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet.  I'm able to have my music with me at all times, plus a large number of photos.One item to note: this type of memory card may not be suitable for high speed applications (such as with a camera or for storing virtual hard drive type information).  These micro cards are a 5 star if used for their intended purpose."
1.0,I bought this twice and twice it didn't work. Never buying refurbished again.
1.0,"I bought two of the 32 GB Sandisk Ultra microSDHC cards, and both of them were unusable.The first one stopped accepting new data when I had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card.  I couldn't add more files, and I couldn't reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.  (I used Flash_Drive_Tester_v114.exe, which is a free download.)I ended up buying the equivalent Transcend productTranscend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly.  I have over half of the capacity in use, and I've never seen any sign of data loss or corruption.  For USB plug in flash drives, I've had good luck with SanDisk products, but my experience with the SanDisk microSDHC cards has been terrible."
1.0,Too big for my laptop
5.0,very good product
3.0,"Great remote, but died a little over 1 month after buying it. No warranty other than Amazon 30 day return policy."
3.0,"Case is okay, for the money. Pen fell apart within a week."
4.0,"Good, but the unnecessary holes on the bottom make it easy for dust to get underneath the case, but more importantly, the holes grab the hairs on your thighs if your the type of guy that likes to work in your boxer briefs and sets your laptop on your lap.  I've gone as far as to shave the front of my thighs to prevent the plucking of my hairs, which does work, but granted that I am a rather body hairless man, I can imagine the more furry the man, , if you will, the more odd this shave pattern may appear.<br /><br />BTW, the two little legs on the back are surprisingly sturdy, when I do decide to work fully clothed at a desk.  I do enjoy typing at an angle."
3.0,"Power supply cord could be tighter works sufficiently ,"
5.0,I use this in my smartphone (Samsung). Push in in and go. No problem. Good price. Enjoying a lot more music now.
2.0,Only the USB3.0 ports continue to work for me.  All front-facing USB2.0 ports no longer work.
3.0,Ok
2.0,"I purchased this item as a supplement to my Unbranded Tablet. It works as intended, and I find the trackpad is the perfect size for the tablet, though I have read that some were complaining about it. The battery life is excellent, though I haven't used it too much. I like how the base is steel, so it happens to actually attach to the bottom of the case I have it in, another unexpected plus. The keys are almost perfect size, though I do wish they were a tad larger. So far, I've had far better luck with this keyboard than some previous Jelly Comb keyboards that simply ceased to connect after a while.  UPDATE: the keyboard has ceased function as of 2/5/16: it refuses to pair, while my Microsoft Bluetooth mouse still pairs properly. It was great while it lasted."
4.0,"Bought this PC with all the excitement of 10 year old me that couldn't afford this a long time ago. But since it got here, there was some issues that came up:<br /><br />1. PC delivery was late. At least 2 weeks late. When we called Amazon to check on the status, Amazon decided that they would just send a replacement and call the previous a loss. Strange.<br /><br />2: The machine RESTARTS periodically. What do I mean by that? As soon I got the PC I installed StarCraft 2, League of Legends and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The machine handles League of Legends just fine. But when I started playing either Deus Ex or SC2, the PC would restart without warning. It happened a several times, enough for me to chat with Acer reps but they blamed it all on the system requirements of the games. I told them the PC surpasses the requirements and they did nothing else to help. To this day, I haven't played Deus Ex. Some owners of this PC blames it on the PSU saying Acer could've supplied a higher Watt PSU but thats all I can say about that.<br /><br />Other than that, I would give this PC a 4/5 since its a lot better than my old laptop. I would recommended skipping this PC altogether (even though the price tag is nice) and save up for another $500-1000 machine."
4.0,Nice bag. Little smaller than I expected..
5.0,I got it and tested it block by block.  No issues.  I tested the speed in various applications and on my laptop in a good USB3.0 reader got no less than 4meg/sec and often a little over 10meg/sec.  Speed will (of course) vary depending on all the hardware and what you are transferring.
3.0,everything was great except for one magnet. I guess the glue used to keep the magnet in place wasn't used properly so one magnet came out right away. I just glued it back in and now it's decent
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
4.0,"Its a memory card that simply worked when I plugged it in. Not the fastest, but not the most expensive."
1.0,Only certain I pads does it work. Not mine.
2.0,Peels of
2.0,Did not fit some of my 30 pin cables.
4.0,Plenty long. Great for laying in bed and charging. Was difficult to plug in at first. Especially when there's a case on the phone.
2.0,"The card is fine, just a warning:<br />It doesn't work with the Polaroid Cube camera."
4.0,"Just a little bit hard to get it on with no bubbles. but Overall , it works fine."
3.0,good but a bit loose
2.0,"Was a great monitor while it worked. However, after just over a month it died. Luckily, Amazon was kind enough to still give me a refund even though I was over the 30-day return policy."
1.0,Don't buy!! They don't stay on at all!!
4.0,Very good
5.0,The problem with rating and reviewing an item such as this one is.. does it work or not..  My experience with SanDisk memory cards has been they work and can take a beating.. and a washing...  what else can I ask for?
5.0,working out great!
2.0,"customer service is very nice, however two computers I received from them were broken. First one the screen was going out and had a shadow in the center, second one had a crashed hard drive. Both of them had all of the standard programs that come with Mac erased. Teksavers said I would have to purchase the program separately, which is incorrect. Apple reinstalls those programs for free because it is an Apple product that is supposed to come standard on the computer and not supposed to be wiped from the computer. If you do get a computer through them, I highly recommend taking it to the Apple Store to be checked."
3.0,"the clasps were a little glitchy, but I was able to file down the extra plastic.great value for the price!"
1.0,The hard disk did not work
4.0,"The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!"
1.0,"Will not find channels any way you try it.<br /><br />Customer service is present and were reasonable.<br /><br />Here is the tip:<br />If this take more than a couple of minutes installing - it is defective.  When it gets to the driver screen, if it takes more than 2 minutes (mine took just over 5 - yes I timed it) it is bad.  Don't spend you whole Sunday, installing, re-installing, re-scanning channels, and trying to read and configure your system.  It does not work.  Maybe you are one of the lucky few that it work for out of the box.<br /><br />I'm so upset with the time I have wasted with this I don't know if I could bear the thought of doing an exchange.  I'm scared that I'll waste a ton more time again.<br /><br />Going to send back for sure, may order a different companys product"
5.0,So far so good. Working great and writing about 17-20 MB/s on win 10.
2.0,I have got two of these both got a crack in the corn and now tablet will not work very sad
2.0,"I bought this as replacement for a Samsung Galaxy Tab kids edition for a special needs young adult.  The things it WON'T do using FreeTime are ludicrous.<br /><br />NO option to access our prime music?????<br /><br />Runs out of storage space quickly, and turns off the WIFI.  BUT it needs WIFI to accept a PIN to open the account for archiving items.<br /><br />We bought it a month or two ago for a birthday and are getting rid of it in favor of another Galaxy Tab."
2.0,"I really liked the case when I first received it, but I had it for less than a week and already the paint is coming off. I am really disappointed."
1.0,Having a problem and they won't help me!<br />Very frustrated.  Probably an easy fix but they won't help.
1.0,Bluetooth sucks unless you are a ignorant
2.0,"In looking for a hard drive, I had &#34;laptop&#34; as a filter.  This drive showed up with that filter applied.  So I ordered it.  After receiving it, it will not fit.  Which I then read buried in the description &#34;These drives are 15mm high, and will not fit into laptops/notebooks&#34;.  Well, I'm keeping it for my external enclosure, but it should not have shown up under the filter of laptop. In addition, the fact that this 2.5 drive won't fit a laptop should be in bold and at the top..."
1.0,Terrible item. It stopped working in less than a year. After A WEEK of haggling with customer support they FINALLY sent me a box and a return slip so I can send it in to them and then 2 weeks later I got my new one. Six months later the new one stopped working.<br />This product is NOT worth the hassle.  Stand clear of it!
5.0,much needed
5.0,"Got this for my galaxy s3, fits well works fine. I moved all my stuff from the phone to the card and working great!"
2.0,"First let me inform you on my situation.  I did not end up using fans with this, instead going with PWM fans, but left my pump using this one (this was pretty much the only option to support the pump I decided upon, the koolance PMP-500, which requires a 32W+ controller).  The pump is set to the first node on this, and only has 3 settings: 0%, 40%, and 70%.  At anything lower than 70% the pump turns off.  So realistically this doesn't give me any functionality to adjust the power fed into the pump."
5.0,I bought this to supplement the amplifier I bought for my sister who's hearing is almost gone. Nothing wrong with the unit but my sister just didn't want to wear anything on her. This mic is a clip on to a shirt.
5.0,This is working well for me as a cheap and easy to operate keyboard/mouse combo for a home theater PC.
2.0,The fan clearly states that it is a 2 Watt fan. I removed a 1.1W from my computer and am not sure that this will function properly. It's very loud compared to the other fan that I removed. Hopefully it doesn't cause problems in the future. I have a early 2011 Macbook Pro 2.2 Ghz.
4.0,"Battery came charged, fit and worked great! I'm satisfied. Thank you!"
3.0,I bought 2 tablets one for my 10 yr old and one for my 6 year old mainly so they would stop bugging me for my phone to play games. One of the main reasons I bought these tablets was because my oldest likes to play Clash of Clans and my younger one likes Minecraft but to my surprise the Clash of Clan game was not available for download and Minecraft was but for $6.99. I called to speak with a representative about it and he said that the developer's for Clash of Clan have not made the game available for this tablet. I wish I would have known that before I bought them. Otherwise the tablets have been working okay but I've only had them for a week.
1.0,Does not work most of the time on my new iMac computer.  Have to unplug it and plug it back in each time I want to use it.  And most of the time it won't allow me to insert a disc anyways.  Wasted my money and waited to long to return it for refund.  Do not buy for a Mac.
5.0,"I use it for my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Edition and it works perfectly, even with Protune! If you have a GoPro, this is probably a great SD card to start with."
5.0,I decided to go with this device as an extender after reading the reviews. So glad that I did. It literally took 3-4 minutes from out of the box to working worhout any issues. I wish my router and modem were this easy. I'm considering buying another one to use as my main router as well!!
4.0,"Works fine, but broke his feet the first wee trying to pull the cover off. It fits very snugly."
1.0,Really bad cables I wasted my money
1.0,Unmounts randomly in mu surface pro 2.  Seems to mostly be centered around write operations.  Trying the samsung version which is sadly much more money.
2.0,"The price gouging on the Origami covers is so incredibly abhorrent that Amazon should include a slip of paper inside with the famous quote credited to P.T. Barnum about there being one born every minute. Good quality compared to plastic cases, sure. But at this price, they should be made from hand-crafted Italian leather by a craftsman named Luigi. I do hope that when the Kindle buying frenzy calms down a bit, Amazon decides to price the accessories a bit more reasonably."
4.0,The case is as described and works well. The only thing I do not like is the keyboard cover which is a slightly different color than the case itself.
1.0,"So I bought this for my 2 in 1 13inch windows laptop. After I used it the inside of this sleeve stained the chrome fiber on my laptop on the rims. I think it was the dye possibly used on the soft inside of this sleeve that caused this rusty look on my beautiful 2 in 1. I was so angry! Now I hardly use it or when I do I try to make sure my laptop is 100% cooled down if ever I use it. The upside I like is that it is a hard sleeve, still it is bendable."
1.0,"How is this for the ultimate slap-in-the-face?  I was with my daughter at the Taylor Swift 1989 tour concert in San Diego last night using my Galaxy Note 4 to take pictures and videos of the entire ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME experience and I even have my phone set to automatically back-up to my Dropbox account just in case something happens.  Despite all my precautions when I looked at my phone this morning there was this message about not supporting the SD card's file system with the prompt to format the card.  While I did not do anything to the card I did power down the phone, remove the card and placed it in the SD micro-adapter and tried to look at it in my computer and then again with a different USB reader and while I can read all other SD and MicroSD cards I can not see/read this card that HAD ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME NOT REPLACEABLE PICTURES!!!!!  Apparently at some point in the evening (probably when the SD card FAILED) the phone started saving pictures directly to the phones memory, but unfortunately the pictures are from the last performance of the evening.  I do like San Disk and I do think they make a nice product, but this could not have failed at a WORSE TIME!!!!!!"
4.0,"Great,except I bent the white usb thingey,and it won't work now.  It charged at a fantastic rate."
4.0,"Like this reader, the feel is comfortable and it works well overall with a nice screen. The &#34;button&#34; set up works, but I would still prefer a physical button. But to pay $200 for a reader that doesn't have 3G still irks me. That, with a few annoying design set ups with the operating system make me think a cheaper kindle is the better way to go probably."
2.0,I give it a low rating due to stand not supporting device
4.0,Really protective
1.0,Did not power our phones well it took 3 hrs just to get a half of charge
1.0,They make you jump through too many hoops!
1.0,I bought 2 of these and had them a few days now and thay are junk thay don't download apps well and thay freeze up like several times a day I recommend buying somthing better like the old folks say you get what you pay for and that is the truth these will be sent back Monday morning.
3.0,"Keyboard is incredibly large and slightly cumbersome. However, I knew that before I bought this product. It wasn't a problem for me and probably won't be for those buying it, but I feel it needs to be said.<br /><br />The lighting on the keyboard was also great and added to its appeal.<br /><br />My major problem with it was that the space bar developed the most irritating squeak I think I've ever heard. Every space between every word became a nightmare and jumping in games was almost unbearable.<br /><br />Ended up selling it to a friend and switching back to my older keyboard."
3.0,The product is ok.  I had a little bit of a problem getting it to fit just right over the laptop lid. I had to cut around the edges to get a proper fit.  I had this for a few months now and its holding up well so far.
5.0,"After using an 8 Gig microsd in my galaxy s3 for a year, I knew I needed a new sd card when I got the s4. This sd card has worked out really well for me. I am no longer worried about running out of space when I take pictures on my new s4."
2.0,"If you're just looking for something to get your wrist off of the desk to avoid that semi-painful hot spot that builds up on that outside wrist-bone, this will be just fine. But it will be *just* fine. The top coating is nice enough -- somewhat tacky rather than soft. The bottom doesn't sufficiently grip the desk, so you get some slide. I use a trackpad and get some slide, so I can only imagine it to be worse with a mouse you actually move around. The cushioning is really just a dense foam. It doesn't compress much like gel or whatever would, which is fine. It does its job, but does it unremarkably."
2.0,"The included cable does not match what was indicated in the users guide. There was only one connector on each end ( not two on the computer end and one on the drive end ). The disk has to be very carefully forced in since there is no room to spare. Ended up trying to use it out of the case since I was not sure if the drive would not short out in the metal case. I said try because it did not work at all with my USB 3.0 ports on my laptop. The laptop did know something was inserted in the port, but the drive was never recognized. ( I did try it in an old Linux machine using USB 2 and the drive did show up, but that is not the computer I was using this for.)  Updated star rating to two. Swapped the drive with one I had in a Vantec NexStar3 enclosure and they both work as USB 3.0 Devices. Still a very snug fit in the Sabrent, but a very comfortable fit in the Vantec."
1.0,It hurts my ears!
4.0,"I like this headset, I'm used to David Clarks which are the same style. These did have a metallic rattle every time I moved my head, I fixed this by inserting a small piece of plastic on each side, now they are fine. The headset cord has the 4 connector plug that most mobile devices now use but also in the box is an adapter cord that converts the 4 conductor plug into two separate plugs for the headset and microphone."
2.0,Very disappointed that I cannot add the silk browser to Freetime. Makes this device pretty much useless for what I bought it for (my son using it at school). Cannot turn off access to the cloud either. I do not want him having access to the games and mostly the books I have on my account!  This device will be sitting on the shelf unused for now because of this.
2.0,"I received the RAM quickly, but 1 set of ram was defective. The company was great and replaced it with no problems.  If not for having to send it back and get one replaced, it was a good buy.  The trouble of taking the laptop apart, paying to mail the ram back, and reinstalling the replacement ram was the reason for 2 stars. The ram works great."
4.0,"my wife like it,nice"
5.0,"Just got a new Razor Max HD with 32 GB and wanted to add more memory, paid a few more bucks for Sandisk and it's always worth it!  The phone recognized the additional memory and I'm good to go with 64 GB now."
1.0,No piece to connect to computer included. It is just a paper weight.
3.0,its kind of slow and the screen will all of the sudden get real big or shrink real small so I have to adjust it again. Its alright but I have some problems with it. For the price I guess I cant complain to much.
5.0,It works!
1.0,"This is rubbish, don’t waste your money."
2.0,I liked the laptop but had to return it. The screen would turn on only half the time so I spoke with Asus support which was very friendly & they said it either has a defective screen or graphics card & they recommended that I returned it. I may reorder but think I will look at other laptops before I do.
2.0,"It's only been around a month since I gave these as a present to my roommate and one side is already significantly weaker than the other. I regret buying from here, fully knowing that it had little reviews. She does not even use these that often, yet the right side is already malfunctioning. I would NOT buy these as a gift again."
5.0,not a bad prices and really adds the needed storage.  I added to Win8.1 and android tablet.  No problems. Plug and go.
3.0,"The product is good as expected, it was upgraded to win 10 smoothly. It is performance is perfect. However the touchpad always stop working and you have to remove its driver and restart the device in order to restore its operation, but it keeps doing that in an annoying way. I guess it is a bug in the driver that needs to be fixed by ELAN, the company that made the driver. Another minor issue is the Ethernet port is very close to the power port, requiring you to rotate the 90 degree power connector every time you need to plug in your Ethernet cable (I do not know why Toshiba did not make that connector a straight one!)."
5.0,"Works great right out of the package, makes a great addition with the 32 GB Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and will recommend it to anyone."
3.0,did not work. supplier promptly refunded my money.
4.0,Nice has worked well for me withmy other electronics.
5.0,Bought this for use in my Canon 60D camera.  Works great with no lag.  haven't had a problem with it.
5.0,"Best memory I have found for consistency and high speed. Ideal for any modern application, especially high definition video recording."
5.0,installed this big baby in my S4 lay night and it is rocking and a rolling did first test think I got 26mb read which I am plenty happy with I was moving things onto the card also I think so not sure how much faster it can go computer I am sure it will be faster
1.0,First cable I bought did not work. Had to buy another manufacturer's cable to confirm the problem was in the cable from Cable Matters. Cable Matters sent a replacement of the first cable...eventually. The second cable from Cable Matters worked fine...for a day. That one too has now failed. Nothing is touching the cables. No stress on the connections. (The other manufacturer's cable worked over weeks without issues.  Going back to that other manufacturer's cable.)
3.0,Top part is all I kept. It's solid but the bottom and keyboard protector are pieces of s***
5.0,Can never go wrong with SanDisk products. You never run into the problem of needing to reformat the disk and I usually store my music on it and plug it into my car instead of carrying an annoying ipod which needs to be synced all the time for new music. With microSD you just drag and drop :)
2.0,Sandisk finally admits that defective micro sd cards cause battery failure in the galaxy s3. I had  mine about six months before it failed completely. I submitted complaint to sandisk and await their response.
3.0,It does work. It fits my 2014 model Mac Mini but it is a very tight fit indeed.
4.0,"I received this NAS free from Netgear as part of a friends and family product testing group. As soon as I received it, it went into a new rack we had just set up for our office. Installation and configuration was super fast and easy. And with in a few minutes it was online and ready to rock. The management website makes the administration of this device a breeze. The iSCSI connection was also quick and easy to configure and set up. We were needing a NAS to provide back up storage for our servers and the 2120 fit our needs perfectly. I would highly recommend this product for businesses needing to expand their storage."
5.0,Performed as expected
3.0,I ordered two of these covers for my Mac. The clear one worked out well and came in a reasonable time. The gold one came broken so not able to use at all.
2.0,"very flimsy, got a good deal from Fry's on a better cover..."
2.0,Did not include the silicon sleeve that it used to have.  Found a better option.
3.0,"Cool, breaks easy.. needs improvement... but its cool tho"
4.0,the mouse and keyboard are working fine
2.0,The computer will not run very long without having to use electric power.
4.0,"if it came with one more fan that wouldve been perfect, nice and sturdy. rubber pieces on the bottom to prevent static is nice"
4.0,ok
1.0,"As many on the Microsoft forums have noted, the gift card no longer works, the website link is invalid. This only has 21GB on the SSD, not 32GB as advertised. Also something to note, even after removing all the bloatware, the PC gets extremely hot, there is no fan."
3.0,a little faster for my computer.
3.0,"The plastic seems sturdy so far and it fits my macbook air perfectly (model A1369). I do have a few problems with it though, it came cracked on the top right corner of the bottom piece because it was padded on only one side during shipping. It also has a couple bumps on the top piece, and the color (yellow) is also much more muted than in the picture but that could be the fault of my monitor. I don't have the problem of the top piece forcing the bottom piece to pop off when the computer is opened completely. All in all, I'm happy I got it, but shipping could have been better. Besides the crack, I think this case will last a pretty long time."
4.0,I've been using this card on my Venue Pro 8 without any issues.  I used primarily to store photos and videos. The card is reliable but not fast.  Data transfers on Windows range from 15 to 20MB/s.  That speed is sufficient for most purposes.  I got my card at $32 which is s good deal.  A faster card can easily double this price.
4.0,"I bought this to expand the limited memory of my Dell Venue Pro. I use it to store MP4 videos and MP3 music and streaming/playing both work very well. Even the description explicitly says &#34;Reformat into file system other than exFAT may cause instability&#34; I'd hope to use it to remap my OneDrive (FKA SkyDrive) folder which requires it being reformatted to NTFS.  The warning is correct--between Windows 8.1, the tablet and the SanDisk MicroSDXC the OS became unstable.  Once I'd reformatted and changed OneDrive's location to it I rebooted Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 could not detect the card. I reformatted the card back to exFAT and it works as expected."
2.0,looks good but very disappointed that the bottom buds started coming off after 3 days of use... bad bad.. returning it.
3.0,The fan itself is great but mounting kit definitely not! The fan has plastic mounting kit on the fan case so the screw might be the broke the plastic hole (which happened to me) and you definitely have to be careful while installing this. Corsair should have change that plastic hole!
2.0,"One day in my backpack, and case was rubbed and scratched all over from rubbing with my textbooks. I take the case off occasionally to clean underneath, but this time the corner of the top-piece cracked. This is because it fits too tight where the plastic clips onto the computer. Won't buy this case again. (One of the rubber feet of the case fell off once too.)"
2.0,I followed the directions and my computer does not work with the battery alone.  I have to have the power cord connected too.  My computer works better than it did before but immediately dims or cuts off if the adapter charger is not plugged in at the same time.
1.0,"I purchase this as a gift for a friend. Once I pass the Tablet onto my Friend, they were not able to use it, since the start button had broken on the first power on."
3.0,"Ok, now considering the price point I shouldn’t be surprised but the eject button broke after its first use.  I popped a disc in.  Popped it out.  Popped another disc in then the eject button no longer worked.  Fortunately the eject button from my Mac worked just fine. Don’t really need the button on the device but still.  This is a very fragile piece of equipment.  Super light but it vibrates, I guess because basically the drive is cover by super thin super cheap plastic.  I bought it because I have an older version of Lightroom on disc that works just fine.  Adobe subscriptions are way too expensive but that is another story. And for this purpose this little drive is perfect.  Works great with Mac.  True plug and play but if you plan to watch a lot of DVDs or burn a lot of CDs this may not be for you. I don’t see how it would hold up.  If you just want to move some music or files from a CD rom on to your laptop this is great.  If you plan to use it pretty regularly, I don’t think this is for you.  I think it will break in about 6 months to a year with regular use."
1.0,Terrible fit. I have to force fit my tablet and it almost had a permanent bend in the middle section where the IR blaster is.
2.0,"Have read the instructions a couple times, had an IT person come out also and it isn't working quite the way I expected. Have not gotten it to work for extending a jetpack range."
4.0,Works like a charm
1.0,Horrible piece of crap..waste of money!!
3.0,"Monitor works fine.  It should not have been labeled as a HDMI monitor. It is actually a DVI monitor,"
5.0,"It performs very well & bought at good price. Works great on my S3 with no problems. i used before on my Samsung Epic but the phone had trouble using it , kept getting &#34;sd card suddenly removed&#34;  notification."
1.0,The connection to my computer is terrible.  The battery would be fully charged but it wouldn't be able to charge to my computer before losing the connection.  I've never gotten it to use its full battery charge.  I was traveling for many weeks so missed the return deadline.  :(
1.0,didn't work on my mac
1.0,The IPad 2 did not work at all.  Some issues with something's. I had to go to Apple Store and they replaced it with a new one! when it comes to buy tecnology my experience is better to buy it new!
5.0,"Whenever I get these cards, the first thing I do is connect it to my Windows 7 or 8 computers, and run this program to format it to FAT32.  Here's the link to the free program:[...]Many phones, cameras and tablets, need the card to be in FAT32 format, and sadly, it's not an option in Windows these days.  You can select NTFS or exFAT, but no option for FAT32 when it comes to this card.Using that program, you can format the card, then load it with whatever music or videos, and the card will work fine in your device.The 4 cards I have have never failed me in the past year, recommended :)"
5.0,"Very fast, reliable product. I use it every day in two computers, saving multiple files from one pc and moving them to another as backup."
5.0,I put it in my Samsung galaxy note 2 phone and have no idea how ill possibly fill it up
3.0,It OK you get what you pay for .
1.0,Even though it stated it was compatible with my T43 the end connector was different.  I donated it to my recycling center
4.0,"Bought for an Asus C300 13&#34; laptop. It's a very close fit. Sturdily built by the looks and a good, heavy-duty zipper; but really just a touch too small. Think of trying to put on leggings one size too small -- you could do it, but it won't be easy and might not end well.<br /><br />Hard to make so many sized things, but this isn't a thick laptop (it's just a chromebook), and I'm not sure anything even a touch bigger would fit.<br /><br />I'm a little concerned that the zipper might damage the corners of the laptop. Not concerned enough to return it (which is probably all Amazon cares about), but it's worth noting."
5.0,"This cover is perfectly designed for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4  I puchased one Tab S 4 tablet last week together with this cover.  Today I purchased two more Tab S 4 tablets, and I just place two more orders of this cover from Amazon."
1.0,"It only charges my laptop, but cannot transfer data.  I bought it for that purpose. I was so excited to get this in the mail... but disappointed now."
3.0,"I like my other one better, the only reason I had to buy another was the fan went. The base on this one is too light"
1.0,"key was way too small, unable to use this product..."
3.0,"hated the brackets to mount the fan, it broke down on the very first day."
5.0,Memory card works great in my phone and other micro sdhc compatible devices. Do be sure to look out for the compatibility of your device. Some are not sdhc compatible. Luckily everything I have now is compatible. The 32gb size is excellent especially for embedded devices. I use mine with the Raspberry Pi using the adapter and it's speedy.
2.0,The TeckNet BM306 Bluetooth mouse works great when it's functionable. I was very happy with the product and it was easy to set up and connect to my Samsung Galaxy 4 7.0. But after ten days of use the mouse seems like it has become possessed by some supernatural power. When scrolling the wheel pages on the web jump around and when attempting to navigate pages on my tablet it has a mind of it's own. At first I was going to give this product 5 stars for value and quality but I will have to send it back. Maybe if you order one it will work just fine.
1.0,"I PURCHASED THE PC MUSIC SPEAKERS & SYSTEM ON 5/12/15 TO MY DISMAY,ON 8/30/15 THE POWER PACK  SHORTED OUT. THIS IS VERY TROUBLING DUE TO THE FACT I CONTACTED THE MFG. CO. AND PRAISED THE PRODUCT. I'M ASKING FOR A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM (same) IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ONE I HAVE.  I had an issue with my pc speaker system. Arion Legacy quickly amended the issue. The co. is very proficient...Thank You."
2.0,"Not to usefull, have the circuit limitation, not really high speed....Is believe is better MOCA"
2.0,"They don't seem to be as durable as they used to be. At one point, they were my go-to cable manufacturer but I need to shop around now. It still provides a charge but does not fit in snugly and this is only after a few days."
3.0,"I've been a lifelong fan of HP, but this is probably the worst computer I've ever gotten from them.  At least once a week, it encounters a problem and shuts down while I have important things open that I'm working on (this has been happening since I got it from the box).  This is probably the biggest issue.  Besides that, several drivers have had to be reinstalled since I bought it, just a few months ago.  The touchscreen is really too heavy for the keyboard, and as a result it tends to fall backward on any soft surface (like my lap), and is very tippy on hard surfaces too.  The touchscreen is okay...but it tends to be a bit &#34;sticky&#34;.  It's not glass like most smartphones are, so my finger tends to drag and leave smudges much more easily, and after a while of using it, the touchscreen gets jumpy and buggy because of this.  It also makes it hard to be precise with the touchscreen.  The power button is quite difficult to use as well - sometimes if it's on sleep, I press it and the computer comes back immediately.  Other times, I press it and nothing happens after a few moments, so I end up pressing it a few times trying to make it come back to life and the computer inevitably ends up restarting itself (again a pain).  Also, and this is such a tiny issue, but has bugged me - about two weeks after I got it, one of the rubber feet fell off the bottom, so now it's a bit lopsided, even though it's still quite new.  All in all, this is just not HP's best offering at all."
5.0,"Any SanDisk product I've ever purchased worked very well and this one is no different.  I use this in my Sony Experia Z1S from Tmobile and I've had no problems.  SanDisk is a trusted brand, this paired with the great price and Amazon Prime eligibility, it is a no-brainer purchase if you're looking for more data for your device."
3.0,Air is heavy with case on
5.0,Does the job.
2.0,These look in the picture a lot bigger than they are - they even appear as if they are over the ear ..<br /><br />The are on-ear .. and small .. I'd say they'd be great for a teen - but for the average adult head - they will squeeze your brains out.
4.0,Very nice!!!
3.0,"I recently acquired a couple of kits to upgrade two laptops, a Lenovo Twist and a Toshiba Satellite. The SSD is great, no complaints. But the idea behind a kit is to simplify the installation process, except it wasn’t like that.  In both cases the bundled software didn’t work as expected. The bottom line? This software tries to deal with things at low level, like BIOS configurations.  Instead, I used a free and simple option that worked perfect in both laptops, and everything at Windows O.S. level!  I also recommend to check about some tweaks for SSD if you are upgrading storage in Windows 8.1."
5.0,If you are looking for a good SD card look no further. I use this in my Samsung Player and it works great. You can pop it in and out of multiple players if you want to give you flexibility. Also priced very good compared to other places.
1.0,"Holes don't align properly.  When I tried to get the holes to align as closely as I could, the film ended-up overlapping the edge of the tablet so that it wouldn't seal. I tossed both pieces of film.  I will buy something else."
1.0,"This thing, within in 2 weeks of buying, started glitching. The screen wasn't registering commands, reboot itself, constantly drop internet connection. It may seem like a decent buy but you are just throwing your money away. Pay a few more bucks and get a better one!!!"
3.0,"the advertisements keeps making the shopping icon show up on my carousel very annoying.<br />cant seem to turn off the locator that tracks you everywhere, an app turned it on and not i cant turn it off.<br /><br />Video quality is good"
5.0,"I bought a new underwater camera. So my 32 GB Adata went to the camera and this Sandisk went to my Galaxy Note 10.1.  On our family vacation I took the newly purchased camera and the 32 gb Adata.  Long story short:  A lot the photos and videos taken in Cancun are gone.  Photos and video from top of a Mayan ruin (pyramid), snorkeling, family photos are all corrupted and gone.  At first, I thought it was the camera until I placed the Sandisk in and experimented with it.  This Sandisk was flawless!  I will be staying away from lesser known brands and staying with Sandisk going forward."
1.0,Slow PC. No good the screen & sound quality. Very difficult to use the touch pad and key board.  Disappointed!
2.0,the controller performs very well....right up until a few months later when the pc cable inevitably fails to work. it gets so finicky that the slightest movement can cause it to disconnect. poor engineering
5.0,I liked this so much that I bought a 2nd here.  The first I put in my Samsung Galaxy Player 5 and the second in my Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone.  The card easily hold all my mp3s and apps.  This card is noticeably faster than the cheaper cards that have a speed of 4 on them...this card is a 10 and when you first boot your device you see all your apps get loaded within seconds.  If you want a good 32 GB mini SD card then this is the one!
5.0,Buy it. I could never commit to paying so much for data until my 32GB filled up so quick. So i wasted money buying the 32GB when in the end i still ended up buying the 64gb.
3.0,"This mobo does its job. I got this installed by another site in a custom gaming pc for a decent price. After about a month, the 8 usb ports (case usb included) I have available, only four work and they're only usb 2.0 and of those four, three works consistantly without having to almost constantly replug my peripherals til they start working. Usb ports on the case are completely dead. If you're getting this mobo for the usb 3.0 ports, spend the extra money and get a better one."
5.0,Really helpful I needed to backup some photos and there was plenty of space left
4.0,"This is a very clever little case.  The &#34;origami&#34; stand feature takes a bit of getting used to.  You often have an urge to fold it opposite the way it's supposed to go.  Outside of that, it is a nice cover with magnetic closure.  Also, the push-up feature for the rear view camera is very cleverly done.  It's apparent that Amazon designed the Fire Camera to work with this case.  Just pushing the tablet up in the case until you feel it lock into a new position activates the camera software immediately without even bothering to log into the tablet itself.  Very nice."
4.0,"Very nice price, went on easily. Only been on for a few weeks but no problems so far."
3.0,"It's ok, still learning how to apply the info but i did think it was going to be better than it is."
3.0,i still don't know if my passport will back up program files---i have not been able to find anyone that can tell me that--sure would like o know that info
5.0,But it's so tiny we had to put a wrist lanyard on it to prevent loss!
1.0,I won't return this as it works if I am careful but I don't recommend it.  Sometimes the keys will stick if they go down in a crooked way and it is what you get if you don't pay much.  It was cheap price and I got cheap.  Save for a better one.
4.0,"I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. This past weekend I couldn't get it to work at all.  I'm guessing it's the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I'm not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working."
2.0,It is not the wright board for my computer
5.0,Great item.  I will get it again.
3.0,little flimsy but it will do
4.0,I just received this micro sd card. Everything works so far. I purchased 2 for my Galaxy s5 and my tablet. So far so go.
4.0,good product
4.0,My kid wanted this and used his savings to purchase.  He loves messing around with it.  4 stars only because there aren't many instructions on how to get power to it and use it with his planned Lego creation.  If you know what you're doing this is likely really nice.
3.0,all right the battery only lasts 30 minutes
2.0,"This bag looks good and can hold a lot of things. In less than a year ,one of the wheels rubber came off. When I contacted  seller about replacement  part for the  wheel ,they stated wheel can not be replaced  .  I rate this product a two because  it is not that  durable ."
4.0,this laptop cooling pad works fine. not to noisy. I gave it 4 stars because I do not like the blue light.
4.0,"I really like this keyboard.  Colors are great and the gentle tapping of the keys is appreciated.  Nothing worse than listening to  bunch of tick,ticking all day.  I do however wish the colors were brighter.  They look great in the dark, but who works in the dark???"
2.0,"I purchased the Modem / Router combination in January and called the support team for a number of issues . Very poor support extremely long wait times to connect to a technician . I will say the Modem is great and I get 330 mps /22  from time warner , the router is the problem .Drops lan connections between computers all hard wired ,no wireless too weak for practical use . I finally gave up and paid the support f $ 130 for one year . i am treated much better and they have a real interest and shorter times to connect to a technician . The technicians attempted a fix the router but realized that only factory default will help . Thus we did it and all my problems went away for a couple of days . The problems returned and we did another factory default and again improvement for a couple of days. I do like the ease of communicating with the concierge service $130.00 extra support feels like I am calling Apple. I do wish the support was as good in the first 3 months but only if you pay extra . So at least I know for sure that the router is a piece of junk and I will shut it off and just use the modem with another brand of router. a lot money spent to get to this conclusion ."
2.0,"I bought this so my granddaughter could watch movies and play games while on the airplane.  When I received it I didn't have any complaints, it seemed to work just fine.  I tend to be a bit clumsy with my electronics (ie, Samsung Galaxy 5 and Kindle-I have had the Kindle for several years) and have dropped them numerous times, I even dropped my Kindle in water a couple of times, but both still work perfectly with no issues.  No, I don't have any special kind of covers on either to protect them, just normal every day sleeves.  I accidentally dropped the Dragon, while putting the screen protector on it, and the screen shattered, I was devastated.  I tried to call the company several times, during business hours, and was sent directly to voice mail each time and all I wanted was another screen so I could fix it.  I found a screen on Ebay and received it today, so I put it on myself.  The screen comes up and I can get onto the tablet, but it is not working the way it was when I first received it, you can't get into some apps and others you have to hold the screen a certain way.  Also, when you touch on certain parts of the screen it won't do anything.  I know that the company should have been the one to put the new screen on, but when you aren't able to talk to a live person then you take matters into your own hands.  I am very disappointed of the customer service they provide and now I don't have a tablet for my granddaughter to use on our trip unless I spend more money to buy another one, which if I do that, I would have been better off buying a name brand tablet for that kind of money.  I won't buy another Dragon unless they can improve their customer service."
3.0,"The ball did not move smoothly when I opened the box m. This is my third purchase of this particular mouse, so I replaced the ball with one from my older mouse.  The older mouse buttons wore out, but the ball was fine."
2.0,"Lagged like crazy, I couldn't log into the simplest of apps (gmail, facebook, weather) without having to restart - and I have great wireless.  I ended up returning it because it wouldn't scroll for spreadsheets and I bought it for work. I would recommend spending a few extra dollars."
3.0,The directions I got with this case is for an Ipad.  I checked online what other people posted about this product and most people loved it.<br />I feel that this item is not what I can really use and may send it back.
3.0,The product was exactly what I needed and worked great but came in a cardboard envelope with no packing materials or anything to prevent it from being damaged.  We were very lucky that the product was functional when it arrived
4.0,Great product for the value.  Wanted  a tablet to stream video throughout the house and in outside spaces.  This fits the bill.  Screen size is acceptable and sound is fine.  Like that 2 charger options were provided.
1.0,I cannot get it to work
5.0,"This case is fantastic. Cable management in this case is a dream come true. I can wholeheartedly recommend it to first-time PC builders.<br />Other good features include:<br />-Side panels that use thumbscrews to allow easy access.<br />-Screws that come in a plastic box with compartments rather than in little plastic bags.<br />-Tool-less 3.5&#34; Hard drive mounting trays.<br /><br />The only problem I have with the case is the fact that it features two 2.5&#34; hard drive internal mounting spots, but only one 2.5&#34; mounting tray. However, 2.5&#34; drives can be mounted onto 3.5&#34; trays, but you will need screws.<br />Overall, as long as you choose quality parts to put inside this case, you'll have a good time with this case."
2.0,"Did not work, sent back"
3.0,"The cover absorbs whatever oil you have on your hands or fingers, and leaves marks you can't get rid of. The green cover is fairly transluscent and after a few days of using it, there are fingerprint marks all over it."
4.0,East to put on but leaves an edge short of exact screen size for original paperwhite
3.0,"Yes, it's a great aid to protect your surface and reduce wear on pen nibs, and its a great surface cover. However, it gets rid of the &#34;feel&#34; from using the actual tablet itself. I say this because the cover makes the drawing surface a lot slippery with no control. This can affect the way you use this tablet. So keep this in mind, for those of you who likes the feel of the original tablet surface!"
5.0,"I bought this Memory card because of the Sandisk Reputation and the Class 10 speed, I use this for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet, the Class 10 speed is really impressive! The Memory card can write to memory pictures as fast as you can take them, loading music is almost Instantaneous and a 5 minute Music video loads in about 4 seconds! I highly recommend this for any Tablet or Smartphone with expandable memory Class 10 speed with Sandisk reliability, worth every penny!"
5.0,"All good things come in small packages...this one especially is value for money, well built, easy to operate and great quality sound (for the size and purpose)"
5.0,Bought a cheap tablet with no storage. This works fine and is fast. Now I have plenty of external android app storage and also videos to watch.
2.0,"Love the keyboard, kind of hate the mouse...<br /><br />Legitimate question... Who at Logitech decided that this mouse/keyboard combo should have a mouse with a wheel that spun with resistance, had &#34;stops&#34; (for lack of a better word) that you had to bump over while trying to scroll smoothly, and made a whirring/clunking noise while scrolling? Is this some kind of &#34;improvement&#34; on something that already worked just fine?<br /><br />I am tempted to send it back as defective but I am pretty sure that what I find unpleasant is a design feature, and I LOVE this keyboard. For now I'll use another USB port for a less aggravating wireless mouse but it seems a shame."
4.0,"Main takeaway: I'm very pleased with the purchase overall and highly recommend it to anyone who needs a laptop for everyday usage.  Remember especially that many people over-buy or get talked into things they don't need.  The i3 in this system is more than capable of performing the majority of tasks most users will require of it.  Gamers who need a video card capable of running the latest and greatest new releases will need to look elsewhere, but this laptop should be fine for anyone who will be mostly surfing the internet, watching streaming videos, listening to music, writing emails, working with word processing, etc.<br /><br />Remember that buying it with certain credit cards (American Express, Visa Signature, others?) will automatically double the manufacturer's 12 month warranty.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- At $350 shipped, it's essentially a $300 laptop with specs appropriate to the price and a $50 full-HD 1080p screen.  Maybe the market is moving to HD at this price point, but I doubt there are many systems out there with these specs/screen at this price.  I was considering a Chromebook or the like, but for $100 (or less) I got a fully functional PC with a full HD screen.  Wow.<br /><br />- Battery life after unpacking and charging overnight shows 4.5 hours on the battery  saver setting.  I suspect 3-4 hours is probably realistic once it's being used.<br /><br />- The screen looks great with a bit of light bleeding on the bottom edge of mine.  It's only noticeable in a dark room while watching a dark movie, so I'm possibly being overly critical.  Again, $350, and wow.  The viewing angles are okay but I'm sure they'd look horrible if placed next to a $2000 laptop.<br /><br />- Not a touch screen.  That may be in the &#34;con&#34; section for some, but I've got an ultrabook that I never, ever use the touchscreen on.  I'm sort of glad this one doesn't have it in order to minimize failures and faults that could potentially be associated with it.<br /><br />- Touchpad - Most importantly, it doesn't appear to interfere with or affect typing.  The left and right buttons are incorporated into the design and there is no edge between them.  The buttons have a fairly loud click when used, although the touchpad can be used when a bit more silence is desired or required.<br /><br />- Keyboard feels good even though it doesn't have the tactile feedback I prefer.  It's positioned well overall and is responsive.<br /><br />- Windows 10 will take some adjusting to, but I am fairly impressed with how quickly it boots even with the factory 5400RPM hard drive.<br /><br />- RAM has a hatch for easy upgrading (see photo), and there's an empty slot available to add another stick.  Remove the little circular plug cover to expose a screw, then you can remove the cover.  I've attached CPU-Z info and screengrabs of the RAM and SSD upgrades recommended by Crucial using their scanner.  I'm not recommending or endorsing them, just offering the data in case anyone needs it or wants to cross reference with other drives/RAM that may fit.<br /><br />- The lid is plastic and textured very subtly, so no fingerprints.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Bare bones 4GB RAM and 500GB 5400RPM HDD, although I'm certain that's a large part of the reason they can sell at this price.<br /><br />- HDD is not easy to replace.

2.0,"It fits the keys, but the outside trim is way too big."
1.0,"When it arrived the shipping box showed no damage, but when I unpacked the charger the converter case was in two pieces. My coworker was there and his first words were &#34;Well, that's random&#34;. He saw right away what I saw. All the screw posts were snapped off inide. At first we thought about super glue some such fix, but I decided to just send it back. Sorry. Just can't justify trying again."
3.0,"Contradictory feelings. Does it look good? Yes, I like it, looks cool. Is it as I expected? Not that much.<br />The package arrived fast and the sticker was all right.<br />My main complaint is that I got a package with a sticker, that is all, no single instruction or anything. OK, you do not need a MS to make it work (for not very talented people like me: I followed this nice video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRlN7Jb_-tY), but if I did it again for example, I would have cut the sticker in two to paste them closer and avoid alignment issues.<br /><br />The decal... it ended up being crooked haha, you can see my first picture. And you really see it is crooked because of the horizontal lines on the bottom of the figure! So I decided to take those off, and then it looks better, I think (second picture).<br />For the record, I have a 13-inch macbook pro.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to provide people with an actually straight sticker instead of a kind of trapezoid I got so applying it right would be easier.<br />Let us see how long it lasts!"
4.0,"My laptop was an old first generation i7 it became really hot since the last year. I rarely use it because of the problem it has but later decided to use it for one of my TVs I brought this cooling pad while it was the cheapest I can find and did not expect it to work nicely. However it did work pretty good. It has a single, large fan, without many big noises. I only wish I can turn off the LED lights."
5.0,Perfect for my G75VW-DS72
5.0,Works just fine for the Go-Pro I bought a few months ago. It's works just great for what it's made for.
3.0,"Purchased this bag for my son as he left for college and wanted a bag that he could transport his laptop in.  The bag came fast and appears to be very durable and roomy.  Unfortunately the laptop did not fit.  He can zip up the bag most of the way but the corner of the laptop is exposed.  At the laptop gets closer to the top of the bag, the bag gets narrow where it rounds over at the top.  I have returned the bag for something larger.<br />My son has a ASUS republic of gamers 17&#34; laptop."
1.0,Too small for ipad2. Zipper broke right away.
2.0,"Good and easy to put on, but after barely any wear and tear its starting to bubble and come off after a month"
2.0,"Purchased new February 11, 2014 and it is made of quality material.  It travels well and is a safe protective cover for the iPad.  It performed well until this past month when it will no longer hold a charge, not at all.  After charging, when the power switch is turned on it goes out in seconds.  Up to this time it has been a great case to use at the office and at home.  With the keyboard no longer operable, it is no more than a bulky computer case.  I was hoping to get several years of use from it.<br />I have not contacted Kensington concerning this issue."
5.0,Works great in my new S5 I love this things. Now I just need to work my phone better so I can use the 32gb more. Over all works great
4.0,"I really like it a lot. It fits my new 13&#34; MacBook Pro perfectly and looks pretty cool. I get compliments at every meeting or study group I go to. I can feel that it is there and sometimes if I'm doing a lot of typing, I will take it off because I'm not a great typist. However, I have dogs who shed a lot and also like to climb onto my lap (sometimes climbing on the computer) while I'm working. Plus I do snack sometimes so it's great to keep crumbs out of the keyboard. I like it a lot better than the keyboard cover that came with my iPearl case, which is floppier and has wider edges that overlap and make it easy to catch with my thumbs under the space bar. (I'm using that one for my desktop Mac's keyboard and will probably cut the edges some.)<br /><br />I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could, as I'm not sure my complaint is worth a whole star off. But I would really prefer that the letters and characters be clear instead of printed white over the colors of the cover. Mostly it's OK, but I do a lot of work at night and it would be nice to see the back-lit keyboard a little better. Especially the function keys, as I don't use them very often, so I have to stick my head down close and peer at the keys to figure out which key I want."
3.0,"There is nothing wrong with this product; my argument is with Apple that they can't make a decent long lasting power cord when they make such great computers?  Their cords tend to break right at the magnet connector, so I routinely put electrician tape in this spot to get a little longer life."
3.0,"Great idea...but will not fit if you have an Otter Box case (Galaxy S4,5,or 6)"
4.0,"Awesme, very useful."
3.0,The challenge is that you have to fold your cable in half and hook it on the reel and then it rolls up both sides together.  Then when you unwind it is a challenge to pull cable off to get the reel to stop and prevent it from winding again.  Does keep your cables nicely wound up.
3.0,"At first I was very happy about this backpack, it's big and fits everything I need. I'm able to put an MSI Dominator GT 72 into the laptop slot just fine, along with my wireless mouse, ps4 controller, and other cords that I need. I also have my school supplies inside, like binders and notebook, calculators, pens/pencils etc. Two water bottles on each side because I spend all day at school (8/9am - 7pm) this thing is FULL! That part brings me to my next point.<br /><br />The bad part to this backpack is like other people have said, the stitching, and a little more I've found personally irritating. I've been using this backpack for 4 days (beginning of day 5 as of writing this review), and already I've noticed the stitching on the right shoulder strap coming loose.<br />So I'm becoming worried that this will not even last me the semester before it falls off my back and my laptop breaks inside. There is just so much reinforcement that I didn't expect it to start to fall apart so easily, or so fast. I have this backpack full, and it's heavy, so I need reliable durability...<br /><br />Another negative  is that the straps, no matter how loose or tight I let the backpack be, digs into my arms and armpits. I am soar from just walking around the university campus, and to and from school from home (a 20 minute walk). The tops of the straps are comfortable enough but I'm really hurting from the bottom of the straps where they end and turn into the adjustable part digging into me.<br /><br />So in short:<br />Pros:<br />-Fits everything I need<br />-17.3&#34; gaming laptop fits nicely<br />-Tons of compartments for organized people (like me)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Stitching immediately coming unthreaded after only a few days of use (I noticed on day 2 of use)<br />-Bottom of straps dig into your arms while heavily loaded"
2.0,"Keyboard works great but after 8 months the letters are worn off of the keys. N, O and H are the worst. So I would suggest that if you are a casual user it's ok but I use it every day and it is failing the test of time.<br /><br />Otherwise it makes a great nightlight!"
3.0,Works OK.
2.0,"Most of the features are nice, but disappointed in the short battery life. When I fully charge it the battery is dead again the next morning even though I did not use and closed all programs. I also wish I could use a different operating system than the default silk."
5.0,"I can't believe how fast this is.  i had a class 10, 32GB card by imation and it was nothing like the speeds I get out of this."
3.0,"Does the job, charges my phone fairly quickly, and it great for back up / emergency, but only charges my HTC One M8 about 1/2-3/4 of the way before the pack dies. I have been seen others that will charge a phone twice over before the pack dies, I would not repurchase."
5.0,This product is great my phone doesnt lock up anymore. I was wondering what a class 10 was and i found out that it means it runs faster than the normal black micro sd card (most are a class 1 or 2) that your smart phone comes with..this card makes a difference in how fast i can get on the internet to...
4.0,"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars."
5.0,Delivery was just as stated and product showed up in good shape.  Delivery included everything I ordered.
5.0,"So far, the new Base station has provided a clear, stable signal, excellent for streaming movies and music in our house as well as our separate home office about 30 feet away."
4.0,for the money i like it .
5.0,There is a reason why this memory card has thousands of 5 star ratings. Good price and it works well.
1.0,It was torn up in the package...
5.0,I got this while it was on a deep sale here on Amazon. I couldn't pass it up. It comes with an standard SD card adapter so it'll work in your computer or anywhere else you can stick an SD card. It hasn't had any faults and does the job.
2.0,"It worked for about an hour, loved the size and key shortcuts... But after an hour, would stop responding. Thought maybe the batteries were dead, put in brand new ones and still no response. Used it on Windows 10 for my Surface Pro 2, but why only work for like an hour? Disappointing :(<br /><br />Returned..."
4.0,Cam on tie and packaging was fine. it swivels on the belt which cause me some concern.
5.0,Found this card at a reasonable price on Amazon and purchased to replace a several-year-old 16G no-name card that passed away. Have no issues so far and being a SanDisc expect many years of use in my smartphone. 32G size allows for plenty of media space without clogging up phone's internal memory.
4.0,"I've had some Targus branded computer components in the past which worked crappy. Therefore I don't believe I will ever make another purchase of that kind from that company. This backpack;however, is excellent! The build quality is wonderful, the layout is perfect, and it is very comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quality luggage option!"
4.0,This seemed to work very well for us.
2.0,"Only works for very, very old SIM cards (pre 2000) that have not been updated -- if there are still any of those SIMs around!"
3.0,"This is a good little tablet...don't get me wrong. I love my fire phone but Fire HD 6 is a little less stable than my Fire phone. I got this for my wife as I thought she would like the way it works. But, it freezes up quite a bit. She needs to restart it about twice a day. Too many problems for what I expected based on my experience with the phone."
5.0,"Fast and Lots of storage, not a flimsy card either. Fells like its build tough. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Side note, if your device supports it and you can afford it, get the 64GB. Youll appreciate NEVER changing out ur card."
2.0,Boots up fine but will not play ps4 disc
4.0,It fits the bill.
4.0,received as posted. good service. product works fine. no complaints.
4.0,"I wanted to travel light with a small carry on roller for a short trip to Japan and needed a case for my laptop and gear while traveling the subways there. This is a basic case and does the job in a slim format. Materials are basic so don't expect it to be very classy but it will get the job done and won't take up much space if you need to pack it. Side pocket is large but not much flex, you can get a power adaptor in it but not much thicker than that. Handles are fabric so I think it could become uncomfortable quite quickly if you had a lot of weight in it. It does come with a shoulder strap though so you have the choice of how to carry."
3.0,This battery doesn't hold as well as the original equipment did when it was new.  It is much less expensive than a Toshiba replacement battery and  It replaced a dead battery so at least I have some power now when I am not plugged to AC.  Mail service was fast by Priority Mail.
1.0,It has fallen apart in less than a month. I have to lean the cable a certain way in order for it to make a connection.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. As identified by CPUID, of the four supposed identical items in the package two were made by Crucial (refurbished as Crucial is their own seller only) and one that was PNY and one Kingston. The RAM PCB boards were different shades of green with A-Tech stickers on them. The latencies of the ram were the same for the Crucial and totally different for the other two. I expected 8GB Ram at 6400 speeds but only ended up with 5400 because one stick wasn't up to par. I bought 2 packages 4GB kit (2GBx2) of DDR2 PC2-6400 so 4 sticks of ram total."
2.0,Not great. Gets dark with usage and ends up looking dirty. Consider the other options :)
5.0,"I really only bought this for the case itself and figured the keyboard cover would be cool to have too, but this came with both of those and a trackpad cover. It's a good deal for the price but I ended up just throwing away the trackpad cover, and the keyboard cover stretches and rips over time. I'm giving this a five star review for the case itself because it fit perfect and isn't really something that gets in the way while using my laptop. I like that the edges fit flush and it has ventilation holes. I took off the bottom part of the case to look at what model I had and noticed that the ventilation holes will attract some dust particles but it's not too much and it's pretty easy to clean. I will also note that this will add a little weight to your macbook but it's hardly noticeable."
4.0,great stylus
2.0,"Lighting too dim to be useful. Font used on keys blocky no-traditional adds to viewing difficulty. Non-gamer, was looking for keyboard whose key faces would not wear off. Keys pretty much blank with illumination off."
5.0,"Excellent product, working perfectly,"
3.0,Had to return them.  We ordered the wrong thing.
4.0,"It arrived quickly, was easy to install, now, if I can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device..."
1.0,It did not fit my Kindle fire.
4.0,I put it in my tablet and so far nothing to complain about. Will see how long this one can last.
5.0,Bought this for my daughters Nikon camera.
1.0,this item does not read credit cards what doI do to return it I no longer have package. 1st time used it.
4.0,"Easy to use cover, not bulky."
1.0,The charger only keeps a charge if the computer is running while plugged in.
3.0,"After using this product for about 3 times, it seems to already be shorting out. Works otherwise."
4.0,"It's not quite as nice as a product from Speck, but it's also quite a bit cheaper, at $16. Good, clean way to keep the soft aluminum safe from dings and scratches."
4.0,good
5.0,Great price for the size card your getting. Bought this for my S3. Can easily fit all my movies now.
1.0,"I bought this wire so that my girlfriend wouldn't have to being her charger with her when she stayed over. After 2 weeks of use, the cord has to be at a specific angle in order to charge properly. Other than this unique position, the cord will not charge the phone. There are no breaks on the covering, so this is just a faulty internal design."
1.0,Awful. Keys are broke and holds no charge. Waste of time and money. So let down
1.0,the color was much darker than its shown here. be careful choosing the color or don't buy it at all.
3.0,"Did not complete protect my iPad.  Got this because my then 2 year old enjoyed playing her puzzle games on it but was just a bit aggressive with her selections on the screen.  iPad screen still managed to crack, unsure if it was from a drop impact or what but still got damaged."
1.0,It's hard plastic and the pillow is small and doesn't help when on your lap. My notebook slid all over the top since there was nothing to anchor it or stop it.
3.0,"good price, but nothing to write home about."
1.0,I had to replace them after 6 months
3.0,"good product, worth the money spent. Thanks"
1.0,the battery is just as bad as my previous one. Its like they sold me a used battery. when i bought a new one this battery last AT BEST 45 MINUTES if that. I am not happy with my product and i will be returning it.
4.0,"This is a great bag!  Material is cute and durable, far better than the boring black bags our local stores offered.  The pockets are the best part because I can store the mouse and cords easily.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I think the handles are pretty cheap. I would have paid more for real leather handles, or eliminated theme entirely because I just use the shoulder strap."
3.0,"sadly this hub didn't work for me.  for some reason, the hub can't kicking my usb items in and out of commission.  this got too annoying after a while."
3.0,"One speaker arrived leaking, which resulted not working.  However, considering what I paid I am not dissatisfied ."
1.0,Got my daughter this tablet for her birthday and she was super excited.  After 4 months it wouldn't charge anymore.  I contacted Pioneer about getting it fixed/replaced under warranty.  They asked for all the information I sent already so I resent it.  They asked for it again.  I resent it.  They continued to do this until we hit the 12 month mark.  I literally emailed them the information almost daily but they said they didn't have it all.  I will NOT purchase ANYTHING from Pioneer again.
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
4.0,great case; fits well; love the color.
5.0,I bought 4 of these for my kids Samsung Galaxy Players.  They perform perfectly and seem to have great transfer rates.
1.0,The headphone broke on the first time use- it was a disaster product
3.0,"It's a nice case honestly. It's good protection, has a secure strap to hold the drive and extra netting to hold any memory cards, flash drives, small cables, ect. It's just seriously huge. It's bigger than your hand. I mean it was my own fault for not looking closely enough at the dimensions and I'll keep it and use it. I just wish it were smaller."
5.0,One word excellent !!
3.0,"It's a little bit hard to insert a drive into usb port, but it does the job great."
4.0,I use these in my Logitech Alert cameras which are outside in the elements. These perform better and more importantly last longer than other cards do.
5.0,"This fits my Acer Chromebook like a glove... perfect fit and very protective. The zipper slides easily and does not come in contact with the chromebook's edge in anyway. The materials are high quality and look great, not like some cheap cases so commonly available. Case Logic makes great cases for gear - this is part of that wonderful lineup."
2.0,Received a charger different from the one pictured. It works OK but the leads/wires are shorter than the originals. Have to use an extension cord.
3.0,"I liked the color, pattern and texture of the Dragonpad@ 360 Degrees Rotating Stand.  It worked fine.  The design isn't the best though.  The iPad pops into the case and is held in place by the hard plastic four corners.  The corners wear after use and allow the iPad to fit less securely.  Also the covering comes loose at the corners too.  This was a fine product for the price.  In my opinion, it is not a long term, high quality item."
4.0,"Excellent service and product. Could not ask for faster postage and solid packaging.<br />The Tablet is exactly as described and runs like a dream. Lots of power for such a small unit and build quality was very good. The screen is HD as described, but as some other reviews have mentioned you do have to be looking at it almost straight on to get the best view. It is too shiny...like a glossy photo that you have to hold at just right angle to see properly. It is something that I have gotten used to quickly though.<br />I use the Tablet mainly for reading books on Kindle and the screen is excellent for that. The only other thing is the battery life. It is just as Simbans advertise at about 4 to 6 hours. But what they don't mention is that it does charge very quickly!<br />Over all I am very happy with my new Simbans Tablet. I did not buy it expecting a $500 Tablet for $49.95, but what I did get exceeded my expectations."
4.0,nice
2.0,"First I love the colors but Im extremely disappointed on it,  the more I tried to use it the more frustrating Im getting, I cant get a good grip on it and I keep hitting the right click button, Im right handed. The cord doesn't bother me, I just wish they made it more easy friendly. I am a gamer but I dont play pc games right now."
5.0,I inserted the 128gb Microsd card and it works great. I didn't even have to format it. My tablet see 119gb which is still good. Once I read the reviews about the card it made me think second about it. SanDisk fixed all the issues they had in the previous years to the point where all I have to do is stick the card in the slot and the space is available. GREAT JOB SANDISK for listening to people's complaints and fixing issues in the past.
3.0,Bubbles impossible to remove.
1.0,Great fit
1.0,Error 28<br />Nothing else to say
1.0,"Have had this for almost 2 months.  The camera takes very bad pictures. The speakers make a popping sound, even if all sounds are turned off through the device and whatever ap is used.  But the worst thing is the touch screen. It doesn't register/recognize a touch more than 50% of the time. Which leads to more proofreading due to misspelled words and games going bad because of that issue. Plus you have to look directly at the screen to see. Any angle at all and the image gets distorted to unviewable. I'm an honest consumer, not a rival or someone that wants to put products down.  But I also believe that the truth needs to be stated about a product."
2.0,"I bought a Arkon Center Extension Car Headrest Tablet Mount for my Samsung ATIV Tab 3 (10.1 inch tablet computer) on May 3, 2015. I was very satisfied with the mount and I had used it for travels last summer without any problem. However, 2 weeks ago, I recognized that the holes in the post knobs became bigger and the knobs screws could not be securely held in the post knobs.. (the screws could be pushed out or in by just touching the knobs). Therefore, the mount could not be securely fastened to headrest. I don't want to use this anymore, because non-securely fastened mount may fall or fly during drive and may hurt my kids.<br /><br />-------Update on Sep. 10, 2015-------------------------------<br />After contacting the customer service department, the manufacturer (Arkon) sent me new knobs screws for replacement for free. I am satisfied with the customer service. However, I am not sure if the new knobs are strong enough to hold the mount to head rest securely. I hope the new screws are stronger than the previous parts."
1.0,"I have had this drive for just over a year and it has started to give me issues. On two occasions recently I have found my laptop with a black screen that simply says no boot device detected. Upon checking the bios, there is no drive listed. I have taken the drive out and re-seated it and managed to get the laptop working again but obviously there is a problem and I fear that it will fail completely soon. I can't return to Amazon at this point and I'm waiting to hear back from Crucial although I'm not hopeful. It worked great for a year but a SSD should last a lot longer than that. Not happy at all."
1.0,"I will be brief and simple.Errors, errors, errors!What happened to SanDisk?  You need to check your QC unit!Awful product ever from a reputable memory company.Update: I got thisSamsung 32GB 32G Class 10 MicroSD C10 MicroSDHC Flash Memory Card Model MB-MSBGA/KRto replace the sandisk garbage. Replacement works as it should. Same on you SanDisk, you lost one of your long time customer."
1.0,"Due to poor build quality this monitor is not worth more than $100.  due to the fact that there is a known flaw relating to loss of picture: the capacitors will burn out leaving you with no ‘picture’ even though the monitor is on.  It will be like the monitor is going into standby mode.  The design flaw is termed, 'Two seconds to black.'  -- You will incur an expensive repair bill, or just junk the monitor.  Needless to say, I will never purchase an LG product again.  If you feel you must own and LG Monitor: only purchase a refurbished model.  I bought this LG Monitor – M2762:  I was quite happy for a few years, [luckily I bought mine refurbished off of an auction site."
4.0,"Very light, nice grip, worth the price.<br />I would buy another one of these if I happen to need another wired mouse."
3.0,still trying to determine how well it does the job
3.0,"First, the tablet holding or mounting, works with a bare tablet only, no case or enclosure is allowed on the tablet. The over all quality, gives me the feeling of not providing long term or heavy use reliability. If you need a keyboard for your tablet to use from time to time, this should fill  the bill and is reasonable priced. I am comparing this to an outstanding bluetooth keyboard by Think Outside, no longer being made for some years, now. It has a pop up flat mounting plate, which you wouldn't consider being much, that holds my smart phone or my 7&#34; tablet, landscape wise, with enclosed case."
4.0,Nice little keyboard cover. Matches my office colors and it's nice to have a little barrier to protect the keyboard from getting really dusty and dirty. Easier to clean this way. :)
5.0,"Purchased this for new Samsung S4 Active smart phone.  It worked perfectly, just installed it, no need to reformat.  I've put the amazon.com URL and description below with frustration free packing part number:SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-ASanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with AdapterB009QZH6JS"
2.0,i used it for approximately 3 months then the battery did the same as mentioned many times. charge it goes from 100 percent to 70 to 20 in minutes. I am having a hard time locating battery for this item.
4.0,It showed up on time. It fits and works great.
3.0,It's very confusing to install & directions are very complicated...  May return it...
1.0,does not work
2.0,"This laptop has a CPU which is capable of Virtulization, but Lenovo has blocked that feature.<br />Also it has a BIOS lock, that mean, you cannot upgrade any of the component.<br /><br />I have same laptop bought from bestbuy. Mentioning the drawbacks just for folks who like to have virtulization ON and allow wifi card to be upgraded after purchase."
4.0,For this capacity and price you can't go wrong.  I'm not sure what class this is but they recommend higher class for video. I would recommend this product. Good luck
4.0,A bit smaller than I thought it would be but is very durable and chic.
5.0,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . no issues till date so happy
3.0,good product
2.0,VERY flimsy - might protect phone while in the holster - but if you drop it while using it there will be a high risk of the phone breaking - packed it up to return as soon as it was opened and saw how flimsy it was
2.0,Cheap
4.0,"I decided to write a quick review as I had been searching for a decent laptop at the $1000 price for quite some time before I decided to go with this one. So far after about 3 - 4 weeks of use the laptop has held up great. There have been very few issues with the WiFi as some people had been claiming (possibly caused by earlier iterations of the laptop itself / Network Adapter), the hard drive runs at a decent speed (however, I could imagine slower speeds for more intensive programs), and the build quality is very good. I would recommend installing or purchasing the laptop with an SSD if you're planning on using some intensive programs.<br /><br />As soon as I purchased the laptop I simply removed all the bloatware from the computer and upgraded to Windows 10. There have been a couple instances of updating Windows leading to the system never wanting to completely restart, but aside from these couple of times it has performed well. As for the heat, I haven't checked the CPU / GPU temperatures under load, but the laptop itself never reaches a heat that I would find uncomfortable to the touch.<br /><br />Overall, the laptop is a good deal for your money (I purchased the laptop for $900.00 during the back-to-school time frame, so I plan on adding an SSD soon with the saved money) that will perform well while *hopefully maintaining its reliability. Some small quirks - not sure if related to Windows 10 or not - provoked me to rate it 4-stars, but others may not have these issues. I will EDIT if I ever run into any additional problems."
3.0,"I am not sure if it is the board or another part that needs replacing.  The tv has always been left on all the time.  One day it just went out.  After replacing this board, it comes on for a split second and is gone again.  If anyone knows something I missed let me know."
4.0,I would give it 4.5 starts. It is not the easiest to install. Once it is installed it works well
5.0,Bought this for a Samsung note 2014 ed. This will give me plenty of data storage as I will be using the note to some quick picture editing
4.0,"great, love it!"
4.0,Overall I am happy with it thus far - the only thing I'm not fond of is how thick it is. I bought it primarily to use under my laptop on my desk so it makes the keyboard a bit higher than I would like. Other than that it has worked well and runs very quietly.
3.0,Product construction not as expected.
5.0,Package arrived before estimated time (well Done). Installed in Galexy Optimus Pro and was recognized immediately. Is working well expanding room for pics and apps.
5.0,Does the job.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, this tablets pretty great for kids which is what I use it for."
5.0,Happy
2.0,"It is at the service depot for the second time already, and have only had it for about two months.  When it works, it does so well.  But far too many crashes. It is back from service depot (2nd time), and just recovered from a hard crash."
3.0,"This product isin the bottom tier when it comes to SSD speed. I used this and an PNY 240GB value SSD in the same machine, same OS, etc and I could tell the difference easily. The PNY was much faster, and was only 10-15$ more. I would only use this in older/less powerful laptop/desktops."
5.0,"Apart from waiting forever for the shipment from China, product works as described."
4.0,"Pro's---this product is an exact fit,for my ipad air.<br />I'm verrry happy..also..lov the functionality of it..it does n looks just like the pic,on amazon..quick shippn tooo..<br />Cons--- in the pic..it looks like where it closes.. and has a velcro latch..not soo.. it's just a canvas loop that you can barely put your finger in.. I'm not too sure, what it's for!<br />And it's very slippery.. it has slid off my chair.. quite a few times.."
3.0,"I was very disappointed with this stylus.  It obviously doesn't work well through a screen protector, and until that gets fixed, anything else is fairly minor.  I had to press hard for whatever is inside the rubber tip to make contact enough to make a line, and when it did make a line, it was inconsistent with the amount of pressure I was using.  I also tried a light touch, but that didn't even register.  Granted, the reason behind it not working so well is that the screen protector is interfering with the stylus' contact.  I wouldn't leave my iPad without a screen protector, I I certainly can't put it off and on every time I want to write or draw.  The wood does feel good in the hand, but it isn't very ergonomic...I could see my hand, over time, getting tired of the wideness.  I am sure it works as advertised, only not with a screen protector.  So think about it before you buy it.  Using the side of the Pencil was a nice touch, and the eraser was handy; but with the screen protector problem, it is just impractical.  Read all the other reviews before making a judgement, and even give it a try in a store, if you can, to see if it works for you."
2.0,"I was hoping that this case would protect my macbook but honestly, this case felt like a school lunch tray with a matte finish on the outside. The case comes in two parts: one for the bottom, and one for the top. The bottom was just the same piece of plastic designed to fit the bottom of the macbook air. The floral design isn't as crisp as seen in the picture shown and it's pretty heavily pixelated as it looks like someone tried to print the design with a printer running low on ink. Over all, I don't think the case is even worth the cheap price I paid."
5.0,It worked well that one time I put some files on it. It was easily read by my computer and phone. Then I lost it because it was so tiny. Oh well!
1.0,I bought this headset for my son for his birthday. He just plugged it into his computer and it started STEAMING and won't work 10 minutes after he started using it. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product!
5.0,Shipped fast and worked really well!  I use this just in case I have to take a lot of photos! Loads fast!
3.0,some of the ipad was so not good. one of it  screen is broken
1.0,This board is garbage. I bought one from a computer store in Dallas ( first mistake ) that had a ridiculously hard return policy. The board had NMI hardware failures that shut down my pc at random intervals. Once I finally got he board back it had the same problem. There is no service after the sale from ASROCK. Several emails begging for help have gone unanswered for nearly three months now. I have gone back to ASUS. Never had a problem with any of their products. I will never buy anything with the ASROCK name again.
5.0,Delivery was on time and the device worked perfectly for my Microsoft Surface Pro. I needed extra memory for my Surface and this 64G was perfect.
2.0,The &#34;M&#34; key fell off after three days of light use. The &#34;@&#34; key and &#34;!&#34; keys where transposed. Returned.
1.0,So I purchased this because if its amazing reviews.. And now 2 days after the return policy expires it completely stopped working. It will not let me retrieve nor load anything else on it. Total waste of money.. Be sure to read all the reviews not just the first few who give it four stars
5.0,"Bought this for my Samsung Tab3.  Works great, fast and have not had a problem.  This will also work with the Samsung Galaxy S4."
4.0,"Great case very sturdy, cam with just  a USB plug and very  minimal instruction, Other then not knowing how to get it to even post on Facebook ! Other then that it has multi color lighted keyboard, just learning it is the task at hand ."
5.0,"Turns my smartphone into an iPod effectively! You can store music, pictures, videos and more on it. It can be accessed directly with an adapter or indirectly via micro USB to USB (2.0, 3.0). Would highly recommend!"
2.0,"Updated review #2 (March 15th, 2016) - Becoming displeased with this item.<br />Following the March 12th  review I contacted the manufacturer (in China) to see if they could provide drivers or some other method to make it work on Win 10. Their response was that it DOES work. I have tried in on 5 different Win 10 machines, a Win 10 Surface and even a Win Server 2012 machine. It does not work on any of them. But when I plugged it into my Win 8 machine, it worked fine. The manufacturer indicated that should update to the latest USB drivers. Windows reports that I already have the latest driver! Here is the text of their reply:<br /><br />Dear Customer:<br />We have seen your message on orico.cc, per check with our Tech-team our product 2588US3 does support with WIN10 and it is just an enclosure and does not have special driver, it is drove by your PC USB drive ,you can update your USB driver or update your motherboard driver.<br />Any question please feel free to contact me, thank you.<br />Best Regards<br />Joseph<br /><br />To make matters worse, the reply came from a send only email address so I cannot even reply with my findings. (I suspect they simply do not care anyway.)<br /><br />On a positive note, I ordered a similar item from Amazon. It came in two days and works fine on all my machines.(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PL1SK8C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00)<br /><br />Updated review (March 12th, 2016) - Not quite so pleased!<br />While the drive worked as expected when connected to my Win 7 machine it is NOT functional under Windows 10. There are no custom drivers and it won't work with the generic USB Mass Storage driver. I spent several hours on the internet and with Microsoft tech support and finally determined that it just is not compatible,<br /><br />Original review:<br />Worked perfectly. All you have to do is slide the drive into the socket, put on the lid and connect the USB cable. I used mine to clone my OS drive using theincluded (limited functionality) copy of Acronis True Image. That too, worked flawlessly. It took about two hours, (probably because the machine only has USB 2.0 ports), but the result was a perfect copy.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the product, especially at the price."
5.0,Larger than move and was a high class.I use this on my S4 and works wonderfully.I store all images on SD take quck second to load but much faster and better than the last SD card i had which was a class 6
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
3.0,"dont really like it, the threads on the 2 that ive had are coming lose. i can see why they have a life time warranty, you have to keep sending them back, it's a waste of time."
4.0,"its a memory card and has the reputation you expect from SanDisk. I thankfully didn't get a knock off, counterfeit, card because It was bought official threw Amazon. it works as advertized and at full capacity (59~ gigs after formatting, which is to be expected) it has good speed for things like games movies music and photos (view/shooting) I've owned it for about two weeks now and its been reliable giving me no reason to doubt it.if you have a low capacity phone/tablet/device you should buy a card and SanDisk is probably the brand you should go with. the price is rite (through Amazon) and they are backed by both the manufacturer and the distributor with a warranty (Amazon A-Z 30 day, and SanDisk- 6mo parts I think it is) its better than you can get with budget or discount cards you find elsewhere.I recommend this product to customers looking for quality storage space."
1.0,"It didn't work for me, unfortunately. Now not sure what I will do with this since I had it shipped overseas."
4.0,It's works very well..
5.0,I bought this for my Raspberry Pi.  It is large enough to run a full LAMP server.  The price / speed are a good bargain.
4.0,"I bought this for my son's tablet for cartoon videos, movies and &#34;all&#34; games he will be downloading (He's under 5 yrs so they'll be small simple games)."
2.0,Disappointed with cords because we have to remove devices from cases to use.<br />Always annoying with messages popping up about cord not being compatible with Apple products.<br />Would be better off to buy Apple approved products
2.0,This would be a great product if it didn't constantly chip and crack. I have never dropped my computer yet there are multiple cracks in this case. I would return but it's not longer eligible for returns.
2.0,They Shut off every 10 min or so very annoying
2.0,It says dod military but doesn't work most of the time on dod websites
5.0,"The sound on these are way better than my old external computer speakers. Granted those were probably 7 or 8 years old, so dated a bit. For the price though, these are fantastic. Several people mentioned a rattling sound from the buttons on the front. I have not noticed any such noise, even when seeking it out. Great option for cheap external speakers."
3.0,My ears are not large and the headphones fit me pretty well.. The two problems I have with the headphones are that they hurt my hears and the sound is not great. The only reason why its not 2 stars is because they were somewhat inexpensive
5.0,"I always buy San Disk as I had issues with other brands and it always works in every application I used it, phone, camera, tablet, etc."
2.0,"Typing on the keyboard works fine once I get it paired with my Winbook tablet but that can take some time of trial and error. Within 60 days (after the warranty expired) the tracking pad stopped working. I now have to tab down or touch my screen to move the mouse which is a bit cumbersome. Also, disappointed there isn't more on line help regarding this product and virtually no instructions."
5.0,"I added the memory card to my Galaxy S4 so that it can hold lots of music, videos, and have room to grow.  I mistakenly thought that it would allow me to store additional applications, but I was mistaken."
4.0,Was very concerned when I realized this sd card was NOT the correct one for go pro.  But all seems ok at this time.
3.0,Excellent fit.  However the edges exposed when installed are razor sharp and dig in when typing.  There's also a mounting ridge located exactly where your wrist rests while using the trackpad.  I'm going to see it a couple passes with fine grained sandpaper will fix the edge.  Other than that the case adds a nice tactile feel to my Air while carrying it around.
3.0,Works pretty good. Reader is very good. I would give it 5 stars if it had google play store. C'mon Amazon.
2.0,Can't get it to fit sucks just buying better fans next time
4.0,"Four stars is generous considering how much trouble I had installing the software or getting this tablet to do anything on the various computers I tried, but I suspect these are short-term growing pains of a new product and my sense is that Wacom makes quality stuff and that most people buying the tablet will be getting a more mature product than the early release I received for review purposes.<br /><br />The installation CD relies on the availability of online driver files which I do not think were online when I first received the tablet.  I have managed to get the tablet to work (at all) on a new Windows 10 Toshiba laptop - I also tried on an older Windows 7 Lenovo, my new Macbook Air, a Mac mini, and an older Macbook (whose OS was too old according to the installation software), and my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop at work (no go).  The CD could not be read by the Mac mini and necessitated a visit to the Genius Bar at my local Apple store to get it ejected (turns out you need a wired keyboard to be sure to eject a stuck CD).  I may have actually successfully installed the drivers on my new Macbook Air but didn't know it (see below).<br /><br />After numerous hard reboots and try try again I finally managed to complete the installation process on a new Windows 10 laptop - suddenly managed to get to the finish without the system hanging, and amazingly, saw that the tablet controls the cursor, but then what?  It turns out that you have to register the product to get a free copy of Corel Painter Essentials 5 in which yes the tablet works.<br /><br />My adult son is pretty psyched about using this tablet when he saw it - he is more familiar with Wacom then I was, and I expect he will get the most use out of the Windows 10 laptop anyway, so I feel pretty good about this - I think a motivated user with some artistic ability will probably get good use out of this.  Like I said, four stars is probably generous based on my experience, but there appears to be a large community of Wacom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential.acom users and a lot of instructional videos available online - I think eventually this tablet will have that kind of community support and so I am giving it an extra star for potential."
4.0,Very happy with the quality and appearance.
1.0,"This was a back to school gift for my sister. When we opened it in her dorm room we found that the USB nano receiver wasn't included with the mouse--either in the packaging or battery compartment storage slot. The instructions included with this mouse CLEARLY indicate that a USB nano receiver is included with the item. This mouse is useless without the nano receiver for the USB port. Based on other reviews from the past few weeks, this seems to be a consistent problem. The order is beyond the 30 day return policy so now we're out $$ and don't have a functioning mouse. Also, the battery that was included was dead. Skip this and get a different wireless mouse."
3.0,Doesn't work in my s2 skyrocket but works in my Xoom. Odd but I have to suffer with it. Seems about the same as my class 4. Will not get sandisk again unless its tons cheaper. 1 was stolen by some tweakers which sucks
5.0,"Bought 2 of them for each of our new S4 phones and they both work great.  No issues.  Saves pictures to card fast, transferred music from PC to card fast and I can play and view pictures and videos with no problems."
4.0,Super easy install. Works from the get go.  The only reason I didn't give it a five is because it is a little difficult to adjust one it is in place. That said. You get it in the right spot and it will stay there.
3.0,looks good feels cheaply made and sound is TERRIBLE. but it looks cool ill give it that
4.0,"Needed the computer because I will be going to college this fall. After having the computer for about a week I thought I'd share the pro's and con's to this laptop.<br />Pros<br />-Great Keyboard/Backlighting<br />-Fast processor<br />-8 gb of ddr3 ram(upgradable)<br />-Long battery life<br />-Relatively light weight<br />-Free windows 10 upgrade<br /><br />Cons<br />-Screen leaves a little to be desired.<br />-Trackpad can be under sensitive (at least mine is)<br />-Bloatware (all of which can be removed easily<br />-Slow hard drive, 5400rpm, shows it weakness when under heavy load.<br />-Build quality is lacking in the screen, does bend and warp if put under a slight amount of pressure. Other then that, the build quality is pretty average, not as good a Dell, but still pretty good.<br /><br />For the average user/student.<br />-I would say if you were buying this for a school computer or for a business this would be a great choice. For the average user this offers more than enough power to get you threw the day. If you aren't annoyed by occasional slow downs while opening apps, then this would be a great choice for you. And when the computer does start to show its age, you can always upgrade the ram, or the hard drive.<br /><br />For editing<br />-Like above this computer is fast enough to handle most editing/rendering software. ( Photoshop, Inventor, AutoCAD ect.)<br /><br />For Gaming<br />-This is the only category that this computer does not do well in. Unfortunately amazon has this computer under the gaming section of laptops. This computer is simply not made to game. I did test some games such as counter-strike go, the long dark, civ 5, insurgency, and of course Minecraft. If the game is from a few years back you can expect to get around medium settings and 30-45 fps at 1080p. This computer does have 8gb of ram and does have a gtx 840m 2gb (not really for gaming), but it also has a dual-core processer. Most games now are demanding a quad-core processer whichthis does not have, and is the only reason why it doesn't do well gaming. But if your kid wants to play Minecraft he can definitely do so on this laptop. But don't expect to be playing Battlefield 4 maxed out at 1080p.<br /><br />Thanks for the long read, if you have any questions do not be afraid to ask."
5.0,"Quick speeds and a ton of memory.If you have an expandable slot, get this.It was nice being able to store all my photos, videos, and music on my phone finally."
5.0,"Always Buy More Memory is my new rule. This memory card is easy to use and captures loads of video, but you do need to download every PM. Works fine with my Mac, have not used it with a PC."
5.0,"It's amazing to think that I need the space, but I do, and 32 GB is nice. Love not having to worry about needing more space on my phone...yet."
4.0,Good cover perfectly fitted the board
5.0,"I wasn't expecting great transfer times like I get with nice compact flash cards, but this card is closer to those than the last generation of SD.  Wow."
4.0,All ok.
3.0,"As much as we've liked previous Kindles, this particular variety does not support games which I didn't realize when I bought it. The children like to play crossword puzzle and other word games. Currently only 2 of my 3 children have that capability though they have similar Kindles."
1.0,"Worthless, does not work at all.  Not worth my time returning but this thing does not work."
4.0,"If you are not Overclocking, this is the best to go with."
1.0,"I thought buying this directly from amazon would guarantee me an ""authentic"" sandisk.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I got an ""authentic"" one or not, but it's failed within 6 months.  Either it's not authentic or sandisk has really dropped the ball on quality.  P.s. it's made in CHINA - if that tells you anything."
5.0,This microsd card was as described by others and sandisk themselves. Very fast transfers and awesome price for it. Got it for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and love it!
4.0,Not easy to use 3rd party backup software with.
1.0,Need special headphones with this on
4.0,"Great offer, great value. I mostly do reading (it's a Kindle, after all) on this unit but checking email (Gmail), Facebook and Twitter makes it very handy. Would like to see it hold a charge longer (average three-four days between charges) but love form factor and ruggedness. Overall, very pleased!"
2.0,Doesn't smell like the other reviews so that's a plus. This case is way too slippery. There is no grip when I'm holding it and it feels like my tablet is going to slip through my hands. It fits nicely and looks great but unfortunately I'll need a case that is more rubbery for grip.
2.0,The case is not long lasting. After a month using it the case starting to break on the sides .
2.0,Very cheap and flimsy. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"not sure what to say really.  It works well , but one major downfall.  When you are using it and accidently right click it sends you back to the place you were before.  Very frustrating and makes playing games on facebook nearly impossible.  Not sure if there is a way to fix it.  If so my review would change dramatically.  Otherwise, it's a wonderful mouse."
5.0,Excellent
3.0,I like it so so...the case is fine for adults but not for the kids it's not protected good enough..and the ipad2 its to heavy to hold it up
4.0,A bit expensive. Like all things Apple.
4.0,Great for the price!
5.0,Love the purple cover. It keeps my kindle safe for taking pictures. I have another cover but have to move the kindle up to take photos.  This cover has opening for taking pictures.  I use this cover when traveling because it is sturdy and fits in my purse.  I am glad I purchased this cover and will purchase again the future.
5.0,"FINALLY! I used to have a 5 button mouse back in the early 00's, and loved it. Since then most gaming mice have come with a bunch of extra features, a 6th button or extra macro buttons, and missed the mark, as far as I care.<br /><br />This mouse is perfect. It is a 5 button mouse with a DPI switch just below the scroll.  The buttons are all easily reachable, and there are no extra macro buttons. The coloration of the mouse lights look really great, and it responds really well. The side buttons are click buttons, not plastic domes. The middle mouse does not have a left/right scroll function, which was annoying me about other mice that I have been using in this class.<br /><br />A feature that's not really displayed very well here is on the underside, there are some small glide feet right around the sensor that help keep junk away from the lens, which is pretty nice in a house with shedding pets.<br /><br />This mouse is KISS through and through, and has great style with it. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great mouse, not just for gaming!"
3.0,"I purchased this battery about 17 months ago and I've had right at 224 charge cycles on this battery. I felt this was an appropriate time to do a review because it's right when the warranty expires.  I would say this battery is average or a little below compared to the OEM battery. According to Apple website the OEM battery should get 300 cycles with an average lifespan of about 2 1/2 - 3 hours (see attached image). I'm at 224 cycles on my Anker battery and I get about an hour and fifteen minutes of use time. This is just minimal usage with the screen all the way down while I'm in class.  I feel like I should still be getting a little bit more usage out of this battery, but overall its ok.[[ASIN:B0075ZZUQ2 Anker New Laptop Battery for Macbook 13&#34; Apple A1185 A1181 MA254 MA255 MA472 MA561 MA566 MA700 MA701 MB061 MB062 Series - 18 Months Warranty [Li-polymer 3-cell 5600mAh]]]"
5.0,"This item hasn't failed me yet.  Using it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone.  I keep music and pictures on it, both seem easily accessible."
4.0,Not extremely impressed but quite a good value for the cost. Touch is a bit sluggish. Wish that Swype was included in the keyboard. But overall a good purchase.
2.0,"Cannot recommend.  My touchpad started out fine, but over time it has become overly sensitive.  It selects whole sections or drags things around without any real user action.  I have turned off everything possible, reinstalled the drivers, made the pointer and double click work as slow as possible, cleaned the surface, even tried to overlay the pad with packing tape .  At best I got temporary improvement.  It is still unreliable and scary.  Searching the web, there are many users that have this same issue for many years.  Logitech evidently has chosen not to make any fixes.  I guess if it doesn't effect sales, why fix it.<br />For awhile (9 months) it was great, now it is just scary."
4.0,USB's can easily be lost.  It would be nice if there were storage on the device but it serves its purpose and great price.
2.0,Doesn't have wrist rest capability so you can't rest your wrist without making a mark.  Finer point makes it easier to input because strokes are better recorded.
2.0,Am returning as soon as I figure out how to print return labels from my tablet.
3.0,"Color was brilliant. Fit was good too. But once i removed the casing to replace on a new laptop, and it broke. It can be quite a struggle to loosen a fixed case."
2.0,Did not fit in my Lenovo W520 4276-3JU...
1.0,They sent me a completely different tablet this one was way better in my opinion but it is what it is.
5.0,"Made a very nice upgrade for my Droid RAZR Maxx, replacing the stock 16GB Class 4 card.  My transfer speeds have improved (though not hugely), and the extra space has made a huge difference.  With a name like SanDisk, I don't worry much about quality or reliability."
1.0,It did not fit properly
2.0,"In real-life use--copying compressed files to and from the card--it clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds: about 16MB/s read and about 7.5MB/s write, as averaged between testing on several SD slots (some USB-connected, some PCIe-connected) on several computers, plus a just-released smartphone. Very unimpressed by the &#34;up to&#34; marketing of SD card vendors and makers.The actual raw size is also about 59.5GB, which I find fascinating for a flash device, which is only ever manufactured with powers-of-two components. (1KB = 1,024B)"
5.0,"Not much to say about SD cards -- either they work or they don't.  This one appears well-built and required no formatting hassles and took to my Galaxy SIII as well as the original or better (the original Samsung card fried).  A month into it, and no problems."
5.0,Got for my Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7.0 . Plugged it in and it works.That is about all there is to it.
1.0,Item loses contact.  Connections are too loose.
4.0,okey
3.0,"Close to unit the signal is strong and consistent, but as you move away the degradation is quick and substantial."
3.0,Does what was intended.
5.0,I reformatted it in Disk Utility on my Mac so that is FAT32. And it works very well in my device (Nokia N900).
5.0,perfect
5.0,Awesome. On time
1.0,Not enough storage for kids
4.0,"A great vertical mouse for the money.  Having to click a button to wake it up is slightly annoying, but you get used to it.  It could be better if the scroll wheel was smooth and had weight like logitech."
2.0,Liked the case but the zipper broke after a couple of months of use.
3.0,"I'm not a pro gamer or anything, but I've been using this set for about 8 months, and I'm not really sure if this is the way it's supposed to be for this kind of keyboard and mouse.<br />Pros<br />Very Sleek<br />Great design<br />Very responsive keys<br />Looks great at night<br /><br />Cons<br />Back light has to be turned on when you need it.<br />Keys are only visible when light it's on.<br />A little too much noise when typing.<br />Mouse left click started having responsiveness issues after some months of use.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />For a gamer I couldn't tell if this is the right mouse, but for me as casual user of video games and PC networking, I can say that this product has too many unused features, and some missing basic qualities, such as mute keys, mouse response, lightweight, and key guides or visible letters. Back-light it's not really necessary, but it's somewhat cool to see."
2.0,Very finicky to get it to play.
2.0,This tablet looks nice but doesnt work well.  My grandson has had this tablet for 2weeks and it is making clicking noises and freezes on him all the time. Games he has downloaded doesn't work and the charger has broken off in the tablet so therefore I am very disappointed with this product. Packing it up and sending it back.
3.0,The screen is easy to read even in sunlight.  Text is very clear and the functionality is straight forward.  It's a nice reader.  I do notice black shadowing at the bottom of the screen.  The battery life given is also based on 30 minutes reading time a day when in actuality it is 12 to 16 hours if the device is on constant.<br /><br />I would buy again.
4.0,Works fine.
3.0,I can charge my Surface Pro only when it is off.
5.0,Works great with excellent speeds formatted as FAT32 with a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2! This memory let's me load most larger game apps (with GL to SD) and media files off the main internal memory. Very fast!
1.0,Bought this and when I installed it in my PS4 it was worse than the original one. Waste of money!
5.0,Not much more to say; it's a good quality SD card that does the job (presently in a Galaxy S5) with no issues whatsoever.  As you'd expect.
5.0,Nothing much to say other than it works just fine and it has great price. Needed another one for my phone after my first one got corrupted after a systems update. Just a tip: If you phone prompts you for an update you might want to take the card out before doing so; I corrupted two cards that way.
5.0,I have always had good luck with sandisk memory cards. This one is no exception. Fast works great in my Galaxy S4 and never a problem with any I have purchased.
3.0,"Overall, I feel like the product is fine.  However, I wish I would have purchased the pro version instead, as not having the ability to move it into a portrait view is rather annoying.  The keyboard also has a few odd choices here and there, like the locations of certain keys. It makes it rather annoying to use for typing sometimes."
3.0,"Received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed. To go left I have to go right and vice versa and to go up I have to go down. When I attach a mouse it's fine but the touchpad is really annoying. I went through the settings and there isn't a way to fix it. Thinking I received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed. If anyone can help me out on this, that would be great. It's a great laptop, but right now it's annoying to use the touchpad."
3.0,"I bought this Tablet 2 years ago and seeing as it's finally given up on me I decided to write a review.<br /><br />It was much cheaper when I bought it ($69) but I still feel as though the newer higher price is still fair. It's a great tablet that's easy to transport and works incredibly well.<br /><br />However, I encountered a lot of trouble with the USB port in the last couple months of use. First off- the port around the MiniUSB port is very small. I haven't found a good nonWacom Brand cable to replace it. (The Wacom brand cable is $22, a lot more than I'm willing to pay for a USB cable.)<br />When googling to find an alternative, I learned this tablet is known for having an easily broken USB port. This is apparently easily fixed via soldering but I don't have access to those kinds of materials.<br /><br />Also, I found the drivers would occasionally switch off while drawing but this is a fairly easy (if not annoying) fix."
5.0,We have the old kindles but this one does a lot more.  Love it
3.0,Good unit but too slow
1.0,"Run - don't walk - away from this festering turd of a product and company. I purchased 4 of these to use as small form factor HTPCs. I have had a 75% failure rate. The problem is with the firmware, which is complete and total rubbish. Worst UEFI implementation EVER. On two of them, no matter what settings I use - UEFI or Legacy, they will not boot from a flash drive, making OS installation impossible. I'm quite proficient at troubleshooting; I tried different flash drives, different OS images, different USB ports on the zbox, even used the internal reset button to clear CMOS. Two of these are just plain non-functional. On the third one, I played with it and played with it and finally got it to boot from the flash drive. Got the OS installed and all software configured, and ON THE DAY that I delivered it to my customer - it wouldn't boot up! Nor would it boot from any sort of rescue/tool thumb drive. To make matters worse, Zotac's RMA process is very difficult and their rep's aren't very responsive, leaving me hanging with 3 worthless NUCs and a 4th that I refuse to trust.<br />I wanted so badly to love this. It has everything I wanted - built in wi-fi, lots of USB ports, great little form factor and at $99, how could I go wrong?! How unfortunate that the firmware is so awful (which, when you encounter this problem, you can't even update even if they release a new version!) It will be a long, long time before I buy another Zotac product. If Zotac ever replaces these things, I'll be selling them without even opening them."
1.0,I am not a kid but I have used computers at work and at home for about 25 years.  I tried to add my National Geographic App but have been unsuccessful.  I would like to get rid of some of the apps already there but that is difficult.  Forget the camera.  I need to use a different camera.  I am really sorry that I bought this.  It was a toss up between a smart phone and this and I really with I had gotten a better smart phone instead.
3.0,It's working good
2.0,"Lagging on windows is there, as well on mac it even doesn't connect. I installed logictec control center on mac which always shows that unable to find any device. No idea what to do."
4.0,"Just what I was looking for- affordable, protects the Mac, fits well, no issues at all."
5.0,"This is a great SD card, it's very fast and works well.  I have been using it for my GoPro with no complaints."
5.0,"I have this in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and love it. It houses all of my music and pictures without issue. It does seem like R/W speed is a bit slow, but really can't complain."
5.0,"Great price for this card. Lots of other places are charging over $40 each!!! SanDisk is a very safe bet. Haven't heard of any forgeries of these card yet like some other companies' cards. 64Gigs give you plenty of room to put LOTS of your music, photos and more on."
1.0,"I'm disappointed, the box said bubble free and it's not .I don't think I will buy from it again I'm very upset . look close to it You will see it"
4.0,"Awesome for computer and 360. Had to download something to read the controller, other than that, really can't complain."
2.0,worked great for a bit then it just crapped out on me and now it will not read any devices plugged into it. and some time my computer does even recognize the hub itself.
1.0,"After a week, I have to move it around for it to work."
2.0,"This is not a very good keyboard. Some of the specialty keys are not in the right spot, particularly the home/end keys. Also, it frequently loses keystrokes, a definite pain.<br /><br />I had to abandon the mouse because it made my wrist hurt after a day or so.<br /><br />What a waste."
5.0,"First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.I have has a SanDisk SD card for 2 years with my phone and it has lasted through the tough times and high heat. I bought this to add movies to my daugther's Galaxy Note 2 10.1 tablet, No changes are needed to format it just plug and play. Buy this product with any of the new Samsung tablets or Note 2 and it will just work :)"
1.0,"This seemed like the perfect solution to be able to connect card reader and/or a USB stick, but sadly the SimulCharge [[ASIN:B00MOQFUQM LAVA SimulCharge USB 1-port Adapter for Samsung Galaxy Tab 4/S/PRO/Note - Model TL-002 (Micro USB OTG Host & Charge)]] won't allow the two to communicate. After several attempts with the SimulCharge it won't recognize anything :-("
2.0,I didn't notice any significant improvements when I installed these antennas.
3.0,"Just OK.  The case is very thin.  The inside handles only function when they are outside of the zipper, so the case will be open if you plan on using the inside handles.  After looking it over, it doesn't appear to be water resistant.  I expected a little better quality for this price range."
3.0,"Installs easy and works as advertised, however the display is pretty small which makes it hard to see the time from the couch"
2.0,"I loved the color and texture, but sadly it did not fit. This case will not fit a macbook with a hard case over it."
1.0,"1. The reason for the SSD upgrade was when I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, I was running out of space on my Drive C. I had no problems with the Win10 upgrade.<br />2. I  bought the Samsung drive specifically because it came with software (Samsung Magician) to clone drive C from a running computer to an external Samsung drive. I successfully ran the software to copy from my internal C Drive to an external USB box with the 500G Samsung SSD. I waited until Magician said it was done (this was several minutes after it said the copy was 100% complete.)<br />3. The Problem:<br />4. I swapped the SSDs. When I restarted with the new Samsung SSD installed, I got the Windows 0xC000000E error. (Boot loader error). Message appears on a Recovery screen—Your PC needs to be repaired. A required device isn’t connected or can’t be accessed.  Error code: 0xc000000e<br />“You’ll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media.<br />Press Enter to try again<br />Press F8 for Startup Settings”<br />I don’t have a Windows 10 install disk.<br />5. I unswapped the SSDs. I got the same error. (0xC000000E).<br />6. On restart, I pressed F8 to start in safe mode. No help. Same error message (0xC000000E).<br />7. On restart, I pressed F12 and needed to tell the system which drive to start from. Starting from the old SSD, I was able to boot my system up. (I’m typing on it now.)<br />8. On restart without F12, I get the same error (0xC000000E).<br />9. On restart with F12 and the new SSD I get the Windows Boot Manager window. After ~two minutes this times out and then gives me 0xC000000E.<br />---<br />I will update this review as I work to resolve the problem--EVEN IF it means taking it to the GeekSquad."
2.0,Great picture quality. One of the worst experiences I've had. My old tv from 2009 worked better. It will start flickering to black when playing games and at some points the picture will go out entirely. Planning on returning it.
3.0,Seems ok ! You get what you pay for. Lol
2.0,Product has intermit connection problems.
5.0,"I've been using this for over a year in a Lenovo Y50 and it's performed fantastically without issue.<br /><br />Read and write speeds are exactly as spec'd, storage size is more than I needed, but great if I go on vacation and want to bring movies to watch.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the new EVO 850 which seems like it's even cheaper and faster."
3.0,Errr... didn't fit Moto E version 2.  At least mine didnt.  But has the free return thanks to amazon!
2.0,Just had a minimal effect on our home wireless network. Easy to setup though!
1.0,Charged my Kindle one time then stopped working
2.0,"I purchased item &#34;Cable Matters® 2 Pack, Cat6 Modular Plugs with Inserts for Solid Cables 100 Pieces per Pack&#34; for a small project (50 or so runs). I've made more cables with different tools and plugs than I care to remember.<br /><br />These are the worst Cat6 plugs I've ever used. They take easily 5x longer to properly terminate. I'm throwing them right in the garbage if they can't be returned simply because $20-$30 bucks is not worth the extra hours upon hours these will cost me.<br /><br />Stick to quality 3 piece plugs from a good brand."
4.0,"Transfer speeds are good, worth the price tag, use it in my samsung galaxy s3, sometimes it craps out and has to be reformatted or rebooted in phone. Otherwise no problems"
2.0,"Despite Crucial's assurances that they &#34;guarantee this memory will work&#34; with my Toshiba L675D, it failed to boot.<br />I went with some other Crucial memory that actually matched the factory specs but was advertised for Macs (against tech support advice).<br />It works fine!<br />Lesson learned:  Don't trust idiot tech support personnel, and Thank you Amazon for your excellent return policy!"
1.0,Did not work on my Amazon HDX 8.9 fire tablet(3rd generation)
3.0,"No complaints on the hardware side. Use and installation with the cd is quick and easy. Tablet and pen are solid and I don't see any problems in the future. I purchased the Intuos Manga and it didn't come with any of the advertised manga studio programs. Basically I just purchased the small with a fancier box.<br />The company however is lacking. Customer service, website and call line are all severely lacking and moderately frustrating to access and use. I'll take my chances with Huion or someone else next time."
3.0,"It works it is a bit of a hassle with the disc, but i used on my laptop and i went from 2 bars to a full 5 the only problem is that it will keep randomly stop working and wont work again for a couple minutes besides that it is a good product i would recommend something else.  Another thing is it says it is $9.47, what i don't understand is why is was charged $20.48 for it.  i only bought and received one."
4.0,"Before buying this laptop, I had read some good reviews and some not so good, so I had mixed feelings.<br />Now I had it for a few days and I am very happy with it. Let me explain why.<br />First the price. It's a deal with this config, Intel I-5, DVD player, 8 Gb RAM, 1 Tb HDD.<br />For this price, of course I did not expect a SSD, but in a few months, if prices drop down, I may swap the HDD for a SSD.<br />I won't say anything about Windows 10 because, so far I don't see what is better than Windows 7 that I used with my former laptop. On the contrary, it takes some time to do correct settings if one wants to avoid all the spying which is activated by default.<br />The laptop seems reasonably happy with 8 Gb RAM. Windows 10 starts in less than 30', including a password.  I installed several of my favorite programs, including Microsoft Office and everything works fine.<br />Some people don't like the keyboard (rubber feeling) but for me it's not really a problem. Yes it reminds me of the first Atari computers in the early 80s. However, what I like is the numeric keyboard.<br />The screen is bright and OK to view movies. Beware, there is a tiny button to eject the DVD tray, so small that it is almost impossible to see it. To make it more convenient, I stuck a small white mark on it, and now it's okay.<br />Overall, this laptop is fast enough for most uses. And again for the price it is difficult to beat."
4.0,Good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for SD card size. It didn't forget what I put on it so I guess it works.
3.0,Worked for a while then started to get really hot.  Had it replaced. Seems to work now.
1.0,"If I could give this a zero star I would.  After only 35 days of owning this computer (and out of the 30 day refund window), this laptop is making a demonic screeching sound that will not go away unless I mute it. Horrible - horrible sound. After 5 months - it completely stopped working.  I would never buy another Lenovo again. I would never buy from this seller again."
5.0,I love this product.  The space is perfect for my device and it runs really fast.  I thought it came at a great price too.  I highly recommend this product!
3.0,Nice cover
4.0,"I love the product, but only four stars because the first one I ordered didn't last much more than a year. The plastic on the left hand side underneath the ports broke in half at some point. The laptop didn't have any major drop or anything. Not sure if it was something I did or the case itself just weakened since that piece of the plastic is very very thin. Once it's on your laptop, it's great. Rubber feet are also very good. Doesn't slide on the surface at all."
5.0,Got this very fast from Amazon and its fast glitch free performance for any smart phone or tablet - Ive used it in both and whereas I thought my atrix 2 was glitchy this solved the problem with hanging up screens and slow access to music and syncing.
4.0,Needed an inexpensive SD card for my new HTC One M8 and this was a perfect choice.  Works perfectly and thus far have no issues at al with it.
2.0,"Stopped Working after 2 months, suddenly stopped getting responses from the keys, the Back light was still on however and stuck on one color. reinstalled its drivers an nothing.  You are extremely Lucky if this Product works for more than 8 months!"
3.0,fine
5.0,"If price is also double of 64 GB card, then it goes straight to my shopping cart. Otherwise it will remain in my wish list."
4.0,"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've had to write. I am so torn about whether I really like this laptop, or not. I've been using this Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 for two weeks. Performance wise, I have had very few issues with it. When I first started using the laptop, it would freeze up, and I would have to reboot. Fortunately, that issue appears  to have corrected itself, and is now operating perfectly.<br />The laptop is speedy, but as you would expect for the money, it is a basic model. My real complaints are with the keyboard, and housing. I've never had a laptop that came in a plastic housing; it's like playing with a Fisher Price toy. The keyboard is very soft, and the track pad is challenging. It's really hard to believe that this laptop will last for any length of time. But to be fair, considering the price point on this laptop, it has a lot going for it, and I have not seen anything that can equal it. So if your interested in a good, low cost, workhorse, this computer might fit the bill."
3.0,"The case doesn't stay flat on the iPad when closed and not used. It goes up a little bit which is kind of annoying.The case isn't that clean either when delivered, as if a person who just ate chips, without washing their hands, touched it and the oily mark wouldn't be erased."
3.0,"This product is an okay product, but don't expect to use it for school and work just for videos and play, or for little kids the screen is way to small, not fast enough the tools are outdated."
3.0,These do the job transferring files to sewing machine!  Just a little disappointed that the cover does not stay in place.
2.0,Got a defective memory card.  Showed only 1 GB instead of the 64 GB.  Returned it for a replacement and never got the replacement!  Got my money back and went to Walmart.
2.0,Quick shipping. Product didn't power my device as stated it would. :(
5.0,"Excellent used to upgrade the capacity of my ASUS TF-700-X tablet, has greatly enhanced the abilities of the tablet, easy to use and to transfer information as necessary."
4.0,"Love this sticker, would have liked the application to be easier, or at least include the items it suggested to use to apply to the computer."
1.0,This tablet sucks! Comes out of package power button faulty.Instruction booklet vague.Touch screen not working after paying to fix switch! Overall the seller is unprofessional!
3.0,"First problem: The tablet restarts games frequently. Second: I only recently bought it and it will not work properly. It has stopped responding to my touch. It is fully charged and the screen is on, but it won't sense my touch."
4.0,"Very nice item. A little smaller than I was expecting, but considering that my first generation Kindle was larger and had the keyboard, it's all good. Very quick and easy sync with my WiFi."
3.0,Not that bad
5.0,"I needed the extra memory in my Galaxy Tab and this filled the bill at the right price. I just wish you could load apps directly to this external memory card since the Tab is limited with 8gb for operating system, apps etc. This card is worth the cost."
3.0,Very slow processor.
4.0,"The cable works well enough.  However, the profile on the micro usb side can too to high if the phone has protective case that does not have enough clearance for the connector to be pushed all the way in.  OTOH, this would be the case for the majority of the cables on the market except those that have market as Samsung cables.<br /><br />Would be nicer if it was 1ft or 2ft to use with a laptop or a desktop that has the USC connection in the front."
2.0,Only works half the time
1.0,Don't buy this .I think the positive reviews have to be bs.I down loaded the software for the Samsung note and a pc.It sounds just as bad on both.This thing is horrible do not buy.Yes I have the HD model junk.
4.0,It's a memory card. What else is there to say. This is a Class 10 so it reads and writes files very quickly.
4.0,"it is good memory card, it is working fine until now. i am using it in my Galaxy S3 just for storing the pictures which i take, so i do not know if it will come up with issues later on"
5.0,"the best quality there is in memories is super fast, wonderful and cantiad of gigas is very good, the best brand and speed"
3.0,"In the end, didn't use it."
4.0,It does charge my tablet but it fits into the tablet loosely.
3.0,"The keyboard is too sensitive,  the cursor always moves without tapping. No more defects.<br />The laptop has generally outstanding performance. Touch screen is perfect."
2.0,It's ok sayings always true you get what you pay for......
5.0,"Very fast! Decent price.I use this for my phone, and it does the job. Never had any problems, it's a class 10 card so it has plenty of speed for reading and writing. Will buy again =)"
4.0,"good price, effective."
4.0,The card works with a Galaxy Note 2.  Install was simple.There are some minor drawbacks I was unaware of when using card storage on my phone.I do notice an initial lag when first accessing the card.Transferring existing items onto card storage is not that simple.Not all items can be moved to card storage.
4.0,"I actually didn't buy this dongle on Amazon, I'm just leaving a review of it here because I used Amazon to price match in the store. (I managed to get a $4 discount at the register.)  I bought this as a Wi-Fi adapter for my 2006 Mac Pro so that I wouldn't have to install an Airport card, which is not easy.   Long story short, I went to my nearest brick and mortar stores to find this item. All I found at the first place were various expensive Netgear adapters with no OSX support. Then I left and went next door and found a plethora of other adapters. I came across this particular D-Link AC600 adapter - it happened to be the cheapest, smallest, and had dual band (2.4 and 5 gHz) support built into it.  Even though no Apple support is stated on the box, I decided to research it - I searched online and actually found a software driver for it on D-Link's website supporting OSX (http://www.dlink.com/uk/en/support/product/dwa-171-wireless-ac-dual-band-usb-adapter). I bought it and took it home.  The first night of purchase, I installed the drivers and plugged in the the adapter. A program called &#34;Wireless AC - Network Utility&#34; popped up upon restart and started working to find available signals. The program has a LOT of options and tabs, but is straight forward enough. I found my router name and put in the WPA2 security information - the program will automatically save a profile for the router. After another few moments, I was able to access the internet. However, I had to enter the security information a couple more times after restarting the computer until the program saved it automatically. Since then, the program opens and runs on autopilot upon start up and gets a wireless connection fairly quickly. It will run quietly in the background and doesn't use many resources.  My signal strength fluctuates between 85 - 100%, but the connection is very stable. I normally use my desktop for uploading pictures, streaming HD video and movies, checking email, misc. browsing,and mass downloading (usually GB's at a single time). The D-Link AC600 has given me NO problems so far.  Pros: - Good price - Dual band support - Low profile (small) - Support for old versions of OSX (I'm running 10.6.8) - Has good range and connection stability - USB plug n' play  Cons: - Sticky driver installation and initial set-up  - Not the cheapest dongle  - No obvious Apple or Linux support stated on box; I had to do a thorough search online to find the appropriate drivers   - D-Link has a mixed reputation  I hope this review helps out some people."
5.0,My only problem is that I have not been able to use its full potential.
3.0,It writes according to SanDisk app test only with the speed of 16mb/second. I have expected a little more than that.
1.0,"This is probably the cheapest thing I have ever bought off the internet. It is made so flimsy. For the price it should have been made a little more durable. It is absolute junk. When I placed my monitor on the stand, I was scared it would buckle from the weight."
5.0,"SanDisk is the highest quality of micro SD and this one will work in basically any Android phone or tablet made in the last 2 years, including Samsung Galaxy S3 S4 Note 2 Note 3."
3.0,The 64gb version does not seem as reliable as the lower gb versions. I have had to reformat this card twice .. a real nuisance. When its working .. it does well.
2.0,"On my 2nd unit and originally reviewed the keyboard positively, even tho'  I bought the second one after the hinge on the first froze up after a year.  Now on my second unit and...same thing.  Admittedly after 2 yrs this time, but it's disappointing to through away a working keyboard because of a failing in their hinge engineering (no, oil etc. doesn't work).  Guess I'll spend a bit more for quality engineering on the hinge. Consider this issue if you want more than a year or two of normal use."
4.0,excellent!
4.0,"It is working fine.  The drivers software interface is a little odd, but it is working fine."
5.0,Added lots of storage space to my new Nokia Lumia 1520. Very nice! The package got here very quickly and I was able to install it easily. The phone recognized it immediately. I did turn off the phone before inserting the SD. It came with an adapter that I didn't need to convert it from Micro SD.
3.0,Awesome. this way i can be gross and eat while using my computer at the same time. The texture makes it a little slower to type though.
2.0,"Decent product, but wifi stopped working after a few days (even after multiple resets and updates). Extremely disappointing"
2.0,"Read the description carefully.  I missed the detail that this does not charge tablets which is a major downfall.  I really have no use for it because of that.  I kept it because the cost of shipping it back just wasn't worth it.  Also, light is BRIGHT!<br />Despite it not working for me....it does work and does what the description says it does."
5.0,Pay attention to your application and what class your card is!  Class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want. Don't be pennywise and poundfoolish... this was purchased to go into one of the newer MK808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10. For the price this was a good value.I have been using SanDisk xD and sD regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card. I can recommend this brand.
4.0,"I wrote a negative review based on the fact that the product failed just after my return &#34;window&#34; closed on August 15. I had only used the hub for a few days. That was obviously disappointing, but Pluggable support came through and sent me a replacement item that seems to be working well.    I like the functionality of this product and hope the second time is the charm. I bumped my rating to 4 stars from 1 with the expectation that the flawed unit was an exception. Fingers crossed."
2.0,"Half of the screwdriver toolbits were broken on arrival, the metal toolsbits fell out of their handles...so all of that is useless.  The rest of the tools don't stay in place, and its pretty untidy, if you move the case around at all everything will move around the case, so open it carefully."
1.0,Cheap crap. Falls apart
1.0,Did not fit my Kindle Fire
2.0,"I was shopping for a low-end discrete graphics card, mainly for 2D desktop graphics, because my Motherboard's built-in Intel Graphics doesn't have a dual-link DVI output for my 30&#34; monitor with 2560x1600 resolution. The GT-730 is perfect. It is inexpensive, low-power, and uses the latest 28nm process, although it only has one dual-link port, and no DisplayPort, so it's only good for one monitor with more than 1920 resolution.<br /><br />MSI is a good brand, and their cards usually use high-quality low-noise components. I was disappointed to find that this card is super-noisy. Because it is a half-height card, it has a very small fan, which will obviously be louder than a 90mm fan you'd find on a full-height card, but I found it to be unacceptably loud, even in 2D desktop mode. I used the MSI utility to adjust the fan-speed curve, but I found that on the desktop, it was already close to its minimum speed, at which it put out more noise than my CPU and case-fans combined.<br /><br />If you want the better GT-730 with GDDR5 memory, you'll be surprised to find that most manufacturers use this half-height format, which is bad if you prefer a quiet-PC. There is only ONE card that has a full-height format, the Gigabyte GV-N730D5-2GI, but at $80, it's somewhat more expensive than the others.<br /><br />What to do? Go fanless. If you can settle for the DDR3 memory, Zotac (and a few others) make a totally fanless card at around $55. I ordered that instead. It is perfect for desktop graphics, but obviously not for games. (I ran Team Fortress 2 (TF2) at 1280x960 resolution fine, but it's not powerful enough for anything more than that) -- I note that Adobe Photoshop can use CUDA cores for image rendering, so the GT-730's 384 CUDA cores makes it awesome for Photo-editing, and also video transcoding."
1.0,IT WAS THE WRONG ONE FOR MY LAPTOP
3.0,"Work perfectly fine. Good noise canceling. I haven't had a chance to try the mic out though. The only problem for me is that they're way to tight on my ears. My head is pretty big and fat though, so you might now have the same issue."
4.0,"The first one I received kept unmounting from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It was a new phone so I wasn't sure if the problem was the memory card or the phone, but I sent the card back for a replacement and the second one has worked fine.  Just under 6000 songs loaded uses just over half the space.  Love that!"
3.0,Part of the corner has broken off after a relatively short amount of time.
4.0,"These are nice inexpensive IPhone 4S charging cable, the cable wirings are somewhat stiffer."
4.0,"I had to call to find out how to use it, but other than that, I really, really like the backlighting."
3.0,"English language only , no Spanish language"
4.0,It fit correctly and did not interfere with my MacBook Pro's touch pad buttons.  I followed the initial charging instructions and the battery has been performing very well so far for two months.  I'm reserving the fifth star to see how long it lasts.
5.0,What else can I say other than the price is right. The quality is out of this earth's modern technology. Pair this baby up with an Android and you got yourself and unstoppable memory machine.
2.0,"Buttons are hard to get to, apps didn't work correctly (es file in particular) and the mini hdmi was a bit of a hassle. I'm not a gamer so I wasn't using the console, which is supposed to be this units main thang. Otherwise it was pretty snappy, but glitchy. Would freeze in Netflix all the time even after many updates."
1.0,"Got this for my Samsung 3.  After 4 months, was no longer accessible - first message I got on the phone was that there was an unformatted Sd card installed.  Next, it wouldn't even recognize the card was in there.  I inserted a different card, and the phone was able to recognize it and play music off it - - so, not the phone.  I also tried having my desktop read the card - - no go there either...."
3.0,"Not really efficient to cool off the pc (-1 to -5°C max), pretty quiet but could not be considered as silent.<br />And this coolpad is definetly thick. So if you want to use your laptop keyboard with your pc on it, you better crank it down to the lowest level, and even there it get some times to get your wrists used to it."
2.0,Broke quickly.
4.0,Product came promptly as specified.  A good experience
4.0,This is my first foray into the microSD card world. I bought this for my GoPro Hero3 white.Pros:- comes with an adapter for easy downloading.- simple to format right out of the box.- reads/writes just fine with no errors.Cons:- the adapter has no spring return like the devices you instert the card into - removing the card from the adapter can be a pain.Overall it's great and does what I need it to do.Hope that helps...
3.0,"Excellent layout, very convenient and professional looking. It has places for everything  I need to carry as an executive consultant.<br /><br />EXCEPT for two defects:<br />1. the zippers are very fragile and break easily<br />2. the stitching on both straps pulled out. (I didn't overload it, except the 17&#34; laptop it's supposed to carry)<br /><br />If someone made a version of this laptop with proper workmanship, I'd love. this one barely lasted a 18 months."
1.0,"You have to download the drivers for it, it's kinda awkward to put on your pi, and feels extremely fragile as you don't want to touch the circuit board, I don't even know how it runs yet because it doesn't come with instructions on where or how to install the drivers."
3.0,"This is a mixed call on this product.  I returned the unit as it was used as a repeater about 45 feet down the hall in a clear path to help keep a strong signal throughout the house.  Most the time it would pickup the signal from my Netgear #1600 dual band router.  But from time to time it would &#34;fade&#34; and or drop the signal all together (and you know what that means). That does not work for me, the other issue was it would not pickup the pass code's for the dual bands.  It took only one pass code/password and allowed users to use any band.  Netgear lets you apply different codes so your higher band is used ONLY as you direct.  This unit did not let me have that option.  So back it went and I will try another brand."
3.0,The camera is poor.  The downloads are easy.
3.0,"only one standing position, wish it had more"
1.0,"My Sony PSP with CFW won't even recognize this card, and neither will my PC.  Junk."
4.0,"I was surprised at how light this product is. Once the cables are plugged into the back, it has trouble staying upright. It would be nice if Trendnet provided a snap-on base of some kind. Since I'm only using it as a wired router in my network, I turned off the wireless radio and so I can't comment on that. For my wireless I am using a hi-end Asus as an access point at the other end of my house. Trendnet's user interface is mostly fine, much better than the one on my previous router. I assume that the firewall is always on, since there's no option to turn it on or off. Overall this is an affordable router giving you gigabit wired speeds, the newer IPv6 protocol, and dual-band wireless, though I can't say how well that works."
5.0,"I like it... Runs smooth at 1080 games like The Witcher with somethings on Ultra, also TitanFall"
5.0,Good Quality
3.0,"If I had ordered this in time to use from the 1st day I received my Dell XPS13, I might have been more willing to put up with the loose fit and less responsive feel. I have not used one of these before, but had hopes maybe I could keep the keys more pristine. Since they were already showing signs of being shiny from use, I am not using the protector now. If I were in a place where spills were a concern, it could be a help."
2.0,don't use it to big
5.0,"I had been using a no name micro SD card in my phone for a while now. It was made by 3C, but it was 16GB and class 10 for really cheap. It actually didn't give me any problems at all so would buy another one in a heartbeat.Anyways, my son wanted more games on his PSP (my PSP actually) so I used that 16GB card there with an adapter so I was in the market for a new card.I got this card because I trust the SanDisk brand, it was 32GB, and the price was cheaper than most. I plugged it in my phone and have not had a problem at all. I can't tell you anything specifically positive, but that is okay in my book considering it means I don't have anything negative to say either. No news is good news sometimes. Everything is smooth and there are no issues. I would buy this card again, recommend it to anybody who needs one, or buy a larger size from them when the time eventually comes."
1.0,"my  keyboard has two keys that are exactly the same, it is missing the light up key."
4.0,"I gave it 4 stars because being a 48GX user, I miss the equation library."
1.0,12used fan<br />2-4 pin actually a molex connection 3-not cpu fan even thoug original search was for cpu fan
4.0,"Great cables. Wish I could have bought only the one I needed, but they are reasonably priced."
2.0,It was a very cute design but it began to tear and rip within three days of using it. I didn't even have any textbooks or heavy materials in it once. The cheap material will not last even if you manage to get passed three days. I would definitely not waste your money.
4.0,bang for buck this is a great graphics card.
3.0,I have two different small solid state external hard drives.  This case is slightly small.  Perhaps I didn't read the description well enough.  Another 1/4&#34; in length and width and it would be great.  Barely zips shut and I'm a little concerned about the pressure its putting on the drive once it's closed.
4.0,"It's pretty much a commodity product made in the Far East, but what I store on it is pretty valuable.  I feel confident in SanDisk manufacturing quality control, in the end."
5.0,I use this in my phone and transfer information back an forth from phone to laptop. Great for holding lots of items. Have no problems with it and will probably get another or larger size
2.0,Cables are so short I am not sure it can be used with tower computers on the floor.  Almost will need to be on the desk
5.0,I bought one for my note 3 and one for my girlfriend and her S4. She takes a lot of pictures and I have a lot of music on my phone so we both wanted the extra room. The cards read and write quickly also.
2.0,It does not seem to charge the batteries on my phone.
2.0,I hate this pen!  It does not record the audio unless it is paired with a tablet or smartphone.  The Echo is a much better pen and also it can record audio without another devise.  I do not recommend it.
3.0,Came charged at ~ 69%.  Did not take long to fully charge to 100%.
1.0,Does not work with Windows 7.
5.0,"Using this in my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I haven't had any issues with it, and it is super fast."
4.0,"Excellent product, worked exactly as described but unfortunately my phone is an LG800G and did not store the information I wanted to retrieve on the SIM card. Could not find anyway to transfer the SMS memory from the phone onto the SIM card so there was no way for this device to retrieve the information."
3.0,Battery doesn't last long
4.0,IN THE TOOL BOX
4.0,"Love my new lap top so much faster than my prior one, but it was 10+ years old."
2.0,Two of the three cords will not charge. Cords are not flexible like the original cords.
1.0,"I bought this tablet despite the negative reviews about this product and for a while I felt like a winner. However, recently this so called &#34;company&#34; shamefully quit supporting this product's software. This might not mean much to the average user used for instance by Microsoft to quit supporting old Windows versions, However, in the case of the Playbook that you have to go through the Blackberry link to add data to the tablet's memory, this means that you cannot add songs via the USB port.<br />Blackberry company, please drop dead! You are much worst than even Microsoft!!!!"
3.0,Nothing spectacular. It does the job.
5.0,"Works well, what else can I say! It came well before the designated time, & I really needed a spare to go in my laptop bag, so I don't have to keep getting under my desk to unplug. Just make sure to put all the necc numbers & make, model etc. when you search!"
3.0,"This is a great little keyboard cover, but it warps badly over time.  The area over the space bar is always a little loose and it gets much worse within a couple months.  Great temporary cover, but doesn't work well for more than a few months."
1.0,Case don't work it press down button on the tablets for the SM-T700 not usable
2.0,"just okay, cheep feeling plastic and the button is extremely hard to locate when writing, not an intuitive design. , ended up returning for another stylus with better rocker buttons"
2.0,Didn't fit . Plastic : material was too thin
2.0,Errors as soon as I tried to use it
2.0,"I couldn't wait to get this camera and put it to work. Living way out in the desert and with crime on the rise in my town, daily stories of home invasions, robberies, car theft etc focused the concern for my family's safety.  I wanted to get a setup with a few wireless cameras to monitor the house and one that would work with my smart phone.Being on limited income due to my disability I was pleased to come across this deal and thought at least I can afford one and maybe add more if it worked out.  I was happy to see it arrived very quickly!  Well, not so happy now that I have been playing with it all day. I am unable to get the wireless setting to work, it only works if its hooked to my router. Also no zoom and when I pan up, down, left or right it has major lag time and has to catch up! REALLY FRUSTRATED!!! I guess I will have to leave it just plugged into my router so it can monitor my sofa."
3.0,"This is great as a protective cover for the tablet but, if using the screen cover to prop up the tablet its tough to put it together then when pulling apart it a pain. I cracked mine trying to pull it apart. It still works though."
5.0,I have always trusted SanDisk.  This card works great in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 2.  I have been using it for about a month.
5.0,"I accdientally dropped it in my garbage can and it got a tiny drop of water on it, but it still worked perfectly! sandisk cards are always faster read speed than sony's cards (the competitor) and this card is muuuch cheaper than the competitors as well. therefore i have no choice but to give this a 5 star and a SERIOUS recommendation."
2.0,The headset I bought workded for about 3 weeks then the adapter cable broke and it is hard to use I have to put it in the right way and set it down carefully and I would like a new headset please.
2.0,Hi this is Abi Pokhrel last time I order iPad hard set cover that Is too big I want to return back
2.0,Does not last long
3.0,"I don't know if it was just me or how my original ones fell of my macbook, but I had a hard time applying these on. I ended up taping them on lol. But now I have a laptop case so I don't have to worry anymore"
2.0,"I was copying several large files to it and noticed speed was not anywhere near claims, using a USB 3 port on my desktop. I touched the little drive and almost burned my finger on it. I did not measure the temperature, but it had to be hotter than130 degrees F to cause such an instant pain to my finger. I returned it for a refund, and I will buy a larger size (physically) unit as I do not really need such a tiny drive."
4.0,"This card is used for my Samsung Galaxy S3 on AT&T and it works great!  Read and write speeds are pretty good, and the card installed and was recognized by the phone very easily.  Great option if you need more storage on your mobile device!"
2.0,"I like the Case in that it protects my new HDX kindle and is light. It does not however fold properly to allow the Kindle to stand so you can read it &#34;hands free&#34; .This is disappointing and as it was not inexpensive, I am frustrated that  now I may have to order another cover so that I get the Kindle to stand up alone while I read it."
4.0,Works as advertised. Simple and secure antenna adapter that does it's job.
3.0,I have seen and purchased these at lower prices so I was disappointed on the cost but I needed them pretty quickly and I knew Sandisc's are good SD cards.
3.0,"after using a chiclet sytle keyboard I couldn't use this traditional keyboard. The button throw length seems like a lot now.<br />But, if you like that style I would say buy it. It works great. This is just not my preference."
1.0,"After installing it on my laptop, I can get good reception to 12 ft on the clear, ie if I place my laptop in my hallway and stay within sight.<br />This shows there is some extended range.<br /><br />However, my laptop is typically docked and at the edge of my table. In this position, reception is only about 5 ft. Reception is intermittent<br />when I move side to side.<br /><br />My laptop's built in bluetooth has better coverage for close range, ie up to 6 ft, so I get no benefit from the Class 1 capability."
2.0,The ball is very very loose! I am contemplating on returning for a more expensive one.
5.0,"I don't know, but it's a bunch. This card works great in my Nook HD, no problems installing or using it."
1.0,"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless.. """
3.0,"the usb drive functions at full speed, but if you ever have an issue and need to reformat the disk, it loses its speed. There must be some some sort of firmware installed on the drive that keeps it running fast."
1.0,"cable i got was actually not flat. so, cool mispost, or poorly sent product.<br /><br />the cable i did get, while cat6 is round. and uh, not that i really care to split hairs, i wanted the flat cable so i could hard-wire in something and not have it stick up out of my carpet.<br /><br />but, it's cool. thanks for that."
2.0,Didn't like having to take the tablet out of the bottom of the cover to stand the tablet up to use.
2.0,Hurts your head and ear don't buy
4.0,"There is no question about Sandisk, and their continued innovation with really keeping storage from any computer for those on the go. With any need for electronic files, or music or games securely stored and protected from computer to phones and MP3 Players and tablets, Micro SD Cards are becoming a increased need for laptops and computer needs. Sandisk has made several products through time, and they have continued to get better with innovation. Their Ultra Micro SDHC memory card handles very well. It works nicely with storing all my media files into one convient package. I like it because I can safely have all my MP3 files, in this card and play them with my Sandisk MP3 Player nicely. This is definitely a good buy for anyone that really wants a bit of extra space. I definitely recommend this Micro SD memory card for all the extra storage space.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
1.0,"Ordered 3 Lenovo laptops as gifts. All developed video problems, with horizontal lines flickering across the screen and the display going black when the screen was repositioned..  Two were returned to Lenovo for repair, all costs paid for by Lenovo. The screen and video cable to the display were replaced. One took a little over two weeks to get back, the other was back in one week.  Third one Lenovo said they were out of repair parts and to return to seller.  Unless we had a horrible string of bad luck, these laptops have an endemic problem with the display. We're hoping the repaired ones will be good to go, but if they just replaced them with the same screen/cable, then the problem seems likely to recur.  Buy the Y50 with caution. I'm giving it 3-stars dependent on how well the repairs hold up, as otherwise the performance of the laptop is very good for the price.  EDIT:  Reduced to 1-star.  Had to return one of the computers to the Lenovo Repair Depot for the 2nd time, same issue with the screen.  We've had the computers for 6 months, and that's three repairs so far.  It's obvious that it is a design or quality control issue with the part that keeps failing.  On the current repair, the Lenovo Repair Depot has run out of spare parts (apparently ours hasn't been the only computers with this problem) and estimated 2 months before spare parts would be available.  The computer is our son's college computer, and we can't afford to have it out of service for two months.  We asked Lenovo to return it to us, which they did promptly, but they reimaged the hard drive before returning the computer, so all files on it were erased."
4.0,"Bought this for my mother and she uses it all the time,mainly to play games and check emails,only thing is and with all tablets the charging cord is not long enough but other than that she loves it."
3.0,I like it just enough to keep it. I'm not sure what is preventing Logitech from making a full-size keyboard with similar connectivity. I have 3 computers with Bluetooth. I prefer one keyboard that can switch between them like my mouse can. Why can't it be full size?
1.0,"Buffalo doesn't support upgrading to a larger hard drive despite manual mentioning using a larger drive. Support told me they didn't sell this device to be upgraded and that I would have problems (which I was), and when I pointed out they sell different size units, and the manual says I can use a larger drive I was told the same line, they don't support a larger drive. When told I was going to return it the Buffalo agent simply replied, Thanks for contacting us, have a nice day. Needless to say I will not be purchasing these products again for my customers."
1.0,it was returned for refund as it didn't work
1.0,Horribly awkward to hold with case cover folded behind tab.
4.0,"So far, it is very nice & my son loves it."
2.0,"Did not last very long.  Ended up buying the Apple leather cover anyway, which I was trying to avoid."
3.0,Delivered as promised but have not had it long enough to see how well it works and for how long.
2.0,"Worked great for about a year, but then the vertical tracking went to crap.<br /><br />Didn't matter what PC it was connected to, or what kind of mose pad I used.<br /><br />Even manually cleaning the laser sensors didn't help.<br />  - Which, by the way, was WAY more difficult than it needed to be.  Way to design the sensors so that you can't clean them easily/at all."
5.0,Not much to say about his SanDisk mIcroSD card. I needed something with more storage and it serves it's purpose.
1.0,"Initially this product was wonderful, but now it seems the cord is not charging properly. It comes and goes as far as the charging capability, needless to say I am not very happy right now. I may have y replace it again."
4.0,This screen replacement was for my laptop that I have dropped. The screen broke and didn't work anymore. Installs pretty easily. Just take caution when handling
4.0,This would be perfect if the surface is metal.
5.0,"Initially heard about the HooToo line of products from a YouTube review and the feature set piqued my interest right away, it almost seemed a bit over the top for such a small product at the price point.  But it was exactly that price point that had me give it a go.  After reading various reviews and weighing my needs I decided to go with the HM-TM04.<br />The form factor is great, roughly the size of a Macbook Pro power brick.<br />What it does well:<br />Battery Backup -- works exactly as you would expect and maybe with a bit of a bonus.  As a real estate agent I am always on my phone and other devices so I have always carried an Anker 10,000mAh external battery bank to recharge my phone on the go.  The thing with the Anker battery back is that I have to physically push a button to get the charge to begin.  Not a big deal but there have been times where I would simply forget to push the button on the battery bank.  With the HooToo there are no buttons to push to charge a device,  just plug it in and it automatically starts charging.  No, it doesn't have the same capacity as the Anker but it's more than enough to recharge my phone and still have enough left over to do it's other functions for quite some time.<br /><br />Wireless router/Bridge -- This is the feature that sold me.  There will be times where I will go to a hotel or home where there simply isn't any wifi available and only having hardwired solutions.  That used to be fine when laptops had ethernet ports and no one had smartphones or tablets but now wireless is becoming more and more the standard.  Simply plug the ethernet cable into the HooToo, turn the HooToo on and bam, youre own wifi with it's own security so you can either keep the wifi to yourself or allow others to use it.  Fantastic for travel.  Ever go to a hotel or on a plane where they limit how many users/devices.  Pay once and bam, hookup as many as you want.  Also allows you to act as a wireless bridge.  Connect to a wireless network and output your own network, particularly nice so you don't have to sign in on every device you and your family has.  Sign in with the HooToo and everyone can automatically connect to the HooToo that they had previously signed into.<br /><br />AC Charger -- I admittedly don't use this too much but it can be nice for travel so you're not carrying a bunch of wall warts around.  The built in AC plug is nice as well, no more carrying around a wall wart adapter to charge the battery back up.  Just flip out the prongs and you're good to go, charge the battery backup all the while charging other devices.<br /><br />NAS -- Mass storage for all of your devices while on the go. Super simple, just plug it in and automatically available to anyone connected to the HooToo network.  Have tested with a thumbdrive to a external hard drive, works great for both.  Awesome for moving pictures/videos from your phone to the external storage without having to be connected to cell service or physically connected to a computer.  Great for vacations where your phone storage might be full and you want to take more pictures but not at the expense of deleting other pictures from the device.<br /><br />Software -- This is the HooToos major downfall.  The hardware is great but the software is fairly clunky.  It gets the job done and is functional but could use some UI/UX upgrades.  But they have updated it since I bought so it's at least being worked on and has improved over the months.<br /><br />For the price you really can't beat it.  It's not too much more than a standard battery bank but you get SO much more out of the HooToo."
2.0,"Fabric around zipper had a small tear which impeded the zipper from moving freely. After a week of daily use, zipper was totally non-functional. Returned."
3.0,Be cautious of this company. They offer 'rebates for good reviews' and then never deliver. Any company offering something for good reviews is questionable in my opinion.<br /><br />Works as described. convenient size. I purchased it for with with a Raspberry Pi but works with my regular laptop and is convenient when working with a projector.
2.0,"Purchased this little bugger six months ago as a quick and cheap alternative, figuring it would be bare bones. It's lightweight and reliable except for the touchpad which can get very buggy. On that alone I would not purchase it again.  Also just learned that it doesn't have large enough capacity to install  Windows 10. I do use it pretty much like I would use a Chrome Book and would probably opt for that, though not for a cheap model, if I were doing it again."
4.0,"Holds a hard drive well, but the bezel doesn't seem to be in the same place as it was on the cd drive.  Not far off but I can feel the overhang and it is a little irritating.  Not sure any other brand would be better."
3.0,****UPDATE**** Very disappointed.  Haven't even had the case 1 week and the gold coating is already chipping off the front of the case...   Nice case... feels durable but makes the phone very heavy. Also power and volume buttons very hard to press.
2.0,did not work. returned for refund. had to pay shipping
5.0,"128GB in the size of a fingernail for this price, who'da thunk it?Works fine in my Sansa Clip Zip (using Rockbox software - probably fine with original firmware but I haven't tried it).NOTA BENE: As with all SDHC/XC cards, it comes from the factory formatted to ExFAT.For Rockbox at least, and probably other software, reformatting to FAT32 is required.If your device or software supports ExFAT, you won't care about this caveat.I'm only using it for MP3 bitrates, so I can't comment on speed issues.The dark red printing on the card is hard to read compared to the white on the 64GB cards.AWESOME!  Thank you Sandisk and Amazon."
4.0,We bought this for our new camera when we were expecting our first child. We use the camera about once per week (the iphone is just easier and usually takes a better picture for some reason) and we transfer the photos to our PC. It has worked well and we have no complaints so far (7 months).
3.0,"I am using it my camera instead But if you want it on a sum sung, this isn't the one to buy."
5.0,Bought these together with the SD and couldn't found any better pricing than these. Just don't know where I will be using it for but it will come in handy and that's lowest price I've ever seen....thanks for the great product .....
4.0,"Comfortable for long term gaming or watching streams/movies and sounds great, mic is not so great, but I bought the headset with the intention of better sound and build quality over my Turtlebeach X12. Have had it for a few months now and thankfully its all still in order. Would recommend! (But if you can get a better headset, then by all means get a better headset)"
5.0,You can't go wrong with the price.  I have ordered about 100 of these.  Excellent!
3.0,thought I was buying a thunderbolt to RJ45 - can't use this.  Not the fault of the manufacturer but it was in the listing results of my search
3.0,"Its alright but I wasn't excited with hit.  Didn't really stand the test of time and the folds in the bottom are so shallow the tablet keeps popping out of it when you touch it which, if you think about it, is the purpose of a tablet over a laptop.  Additionally, I have to take it out of the case if I want to use my earbuds because the left clip that holds it on covers the audio out hole.  All in all not bad but I'd research more before spending on this one."
5.0,"Works very well, uploads quickly. Easy to install and use."
3.0,so so
1.0,Keys stopped working after a few weeks.  Can't reach anyone through a website or phone number.  Very disappointing.
1.0,Unable to install on my laptop
5.0,"Arrived in manufacturers packaging so it looked authentic. I was still sceptical based on reviews I read from others on Amazon, so I called thecustomer service phone number for San disk and they verified it was genuine. You will need a magnifying glass ro see the numbers printed on the back of the card, or alternately you can take a photo of it with your smartphone, I used the Galaxy S3 om Macro or text setting and then enlarged the photo to read the numbers.very happy with this card fast response, have hundreds of photos and songs on this card and it works great."
5.0,WOW!!! A bit expensive but worth the money! On my way to 4k!
2.0,Could get ip address up. Could not use it.used an older version
1.0,Junk.
4.0,works perfectly so far. Just wished the vga screw were easier to turn.
1.0,Arrived on time and works great
2.0,"This was a huge dissapointment!!!  The computer came just fine.  However,  after few hours of operation a crack in the screen started to show.  Called Lenovo and got &#34;cold answer&#34; like : it's your fault,  and it is a physical danage not included in the warranty.<br />Sent it to theil lab to repair and already 2 weeks past and no action was taken.  I had another one just like this in Israel fir one of my workers and,  the screen is blinking after you open it.  It looks like something is wrong with the way they Assemble the screen and it just wouldn't work.  It is a super expensive computer and it is the sconed time it is not working out of the box.  Lenovo has problem with this computer that they do not admit and do not take responsibility.<br />Also,  international warranty???  Don't waste your time on this.<br />To sum the issue : find another high end computer and don't waste your time on thus one"
3.0,"Simple wire, and it works."
3.0,"It was worth the price, but died so easily :/"
1.0,Dont waste ur money we got this item n it broke got a replacemnt n that broke too.😡
2.0,"I purchased this item in July, 2014. The first 5 months I had this unit it worked as advertised. However, beginning in December it began to drop off on wireless. When it started this it was maybe 3-4 times per week. Now it is daily. The only way to fix it is a hard boot; shut down and reboot. Several calls to Netgear Help line do not help. They are willing to try to adjust the settings but the adjustments do not fix the problem. I would not buy this model again."
4.0,"Found these for a really good price.  Bought 2, one for my wife and myself for our Galaxy Note 2 phones.  Hers worked fine but I did have an issue right from the start.  However, luckily it was right from the start because I had almost nothing on it so I reformatted in the Galaxy Note 2 and it has worked fine ever since.  It is recommended not to format it on the computer so I formatted it with the phone.  It works good as for now."
5.0,Excellent!
5.0,Works well.  Charged and calibrated according to Apple instructions.  Get about 2.5-3 hours use.  Good enough for me.
2.0,Stopped working!
3.0,Don't buy if u r interested in working VGA on Mac . The computer won't recognize  it after it wakes up from sleep. Otherwise study make
4.0,"I was having a lot of dropouts and slow speed issues using my Comcast modem as a router, blogs I read seemed to indicate that the problem is typical of combined devices. Plugging this into the Comcast modem solved all my problems.  Solid signal throughout the house."
1.0,It broke the first time I used it.  Very disappointed.  The plug just pulled right out.  I will be returning both.
5.0,very good
1.0,"This does not work. It's a expensive iPad holder. Plus the lense makes the image poor.<br />U are better of using a regular stick, I will return this item."
5.0,"Bought this for my son's tablet (asus prime) and it works great.  We were able to load his music, movies, and a few apps and haven't noticed any lag time as we have in the past with other cards.  Would definitely purchase more."
5.0,Solid performer as always.
1.0,"These are genuine Sandisk memory cards, but from a defective batch.  I lost all of my photos and videos taken on my phone over the last two years because the card had a catastrophic failure.  SanDisk reps informed me the batch was bad and they were aware of the problem."
5.0,I bought this to protect my MacBook and it is doing exactly that! I ended up buying one for my mom because she loved how the case looked with the MBP
1.0,"Most apps can not be moved from device to SD card.  No reason given just error message app can not be moved.  Using class 10 Samsung 32 g card.  Device will only fit 3 or 4 apps.  Bought for my son to play games, big mistake."
3.0,"Update 8/6/2017: Buy this combo for the keyboard not the mouse. The mouse worked for several months then died. Just as well since I never liked it to begin with. The keyboard however has been perfect for my needs and is still functioning well after two years. Any other mouse with unifying technology will work with the keyboard so not that big a deal for me. The keyboard 5 stars, the mouse 1, the combo 3. The value for the money is more like a 3 since the mouse boosts the cost on what would likely be a less expensive keyboard if sold by itself. Which makes the combo a bit of a rip off.<br /><br />Received this keyboard yesterday and so far it is working as advertised. It is slightly bigger and heavier than my old kb. I use my TV as monitor for my laptop and sit on the sofa approx. 6-8 ft away and have the keyboard on my lap when typing. No problem with response, no lag time in typing response as complained about by some other reviewers. I notice the spring pressure on the keys seems a little more taut than what I have been used to but this is not significant and will probably become less as the board is broken in.<br /><br />The overall design of the and look of the kb is nice enough but I could do without the clear plastic trim around the edges. As I examine it, it looks like I may be able to remove it by separating the face and back and just lifting it out. Doesn't appear to be glued on.  I may just do that in time. (Update 09/02/15: Removed clear plastic trim and board has a much better look IMO. It does leave about 1/8&#34; space where the plastic was but board is very responsive and the numbers pad works better than before on my board, especially the numbers 2 and 3. Plastic trim doesn't just lift off. The tops of the plastic tabs holding the trim in place popped off (quite easily I might add) when removing  it so any possibility of returning or exchanging the board if problems develop going forward is negated. I'm fine with that. :-)<br /><br />The mouse is also bigger than my other Logitech mice and the scroll wheel does not have a smooth, fluid roll to it as my others do. It is apparently designed with notches or slots in its roll. While I do not like the feel of it right now, the upside is if my finger accidentally brushes across or touches the wheel it doesn't cause the screen to scroll or jump as with my other mice. Which is actually a good thing. The cursor movement was not good until I replaced the battery with a new one. Appears to be responding fine now.<br /><br />Calculator key on the kb got no response on several taps a few minutes ago but did eventually bring up the calculator and has been working fine since. Hopefully this will not be an ongoing or worsening problem. (Update 09/08/15: It appears when the calculator has not been used for some time it takes one tap to awaken it and the second tap brings it up. After awakening it responds on the first tap after that. At least until you haven't called on it for a while and then it has to be awakened again. Strange behavior for a calculator key seems to me but that is the way it works, at least on my KB.)<br /><br />This is a very early review so will update if I run into any serious problems or defects with this kb and mouse."
2.0,Please chnage the item colour Como Green to Rose Red
4.0,"This card is great. Ive noticed slight improvement in every aspect of my phone. So much space! Very pleased. Came on time. Brand new. Easy to open thanks to Amazon. And it mentions on the tiny booklet that this thing is temperature resistant. Thats a big plus since overuse of smartphones tend to heat em up pretty good. Being from Texas, the heat out here only makes em hotter. And my last SD seems to have fried. Well this is a good buy. If i need another i'd definitly buy again. Maybe the black and gold one. It only available in 16GB but its super fast."
2.0,"I like the protection part of the case, but it doesn't work very well as a stand.  Also not very easy to keep clean."
3.0,Keeps the chip down to 47C.  The fins should be a little higher.
2.0,Those metal clasps in the corners will fall off in a week. Guaranteed.
4.0,Works well. Beware some of these SD cards are not what they say they are. This one is in my Nokia phone. Loaded maps and songs on it. No problem.
2.0,Not all apps available
5.0,works as expected
3.0,"It is serviceable, less than expected..."
1.0,"First day it was used, it was the first day of School for my 15 yr old son who takes very good care of his stuff. the main Zipper broke, it goes off track and opens the main Compartment and you can't close it. not happy at all had to rush out same day and buy a new. Of course 1 month return policy ran out."
1.0,"The product build quality is good and solid.<br />The USB works fine for USB2.0 flash drives, and works on Windows 7 (after installing drivers, since Windows couldn't recognize and install from windows update), and on Linux (kernel 3.16+ no special config required).<br />However it did not work when I plugged a MyPassport USB3.0. It keeps connecting and disconnecting the device every 2 (two) seconds, making it impossible to use. Thus behavior is the same both on Windows and Linux, so it is not a driver issue (I have tried to download and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer, but the error persisted). I have checked the connections and also the power cable on the pci-e board and all is connected properly.<br />I got very disappointed with this, since the main reason I bought this was to plug in my MyPassport."
1.0,terible router. Bought it as a replacement for a great dlink I had for the last 4 years. This thing is terrible. Can't even stream a video consistently. That's what I get for trying to save some cash buying a referbished model. But seems like even the new (non referbished) stink. But hey it's a cylinder. How novel :-/
1.0,did not work
1.0,This card failed after 2 weeks of use.  I have the same problem with their SSD failed on me after 6 months.
2.0,Did not sick well. The end keep flexing up
2.0,Very slow and very little internal memory
5.0,"Works in a Mac pro 1,1. Very satisfied."
1.0,"This card was dead on arrival and did not work whatsoever. When copying files to it, the transfer speed was below 1MB/s and then when I would eject the card the contents I just transferred would be lost. The card refused to format, I got an error message that the lock was on when it was not. Definitely a dud. I exchanged for a Kingston card of the same size which worked and still works flawlessly."
3.0,"It works fine, but it's kind of narrow and not very comfortable to type on (for me, at least). Decent for the price."
2.0,"I bought this to because I wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening, this does not support music files so I have no need for this. I've tried hooking it up with the Flash card it came with, I've tried putting it in my phone and hooking my  phone to the computer, I've tried through my mp3 player...nothing. I can't even get Windows Media to recognize the flashcard. If you're looking for more storage for portable music don't buy this."
1.0,Didn't fit
5.0,"This is the all around do good digital pen, draws, writes, shades, and erases great."
2.0,Very good
4.0,thought it wouldn't work on my PS2 in america but it did. it fits well and truns it on everything I need it to do. only gave it 4 star beacues its not the exact right size.
5.0,"this was installed in my S4, I had no issues like others have posted, in fact I formatted in the computer and  popped it right in."
2.0,I've only had the tablet since Christmas (about 6 months) and it's completely stopped working. It won't turn on or charge or anything. It's completely useless and I feel like I wasted $120. I wish I would have sucked it up and paid the extra for an IPad.
1.0,wrong size
4.0,My fault I couldn't get it on without trapped air. About to try and wash it and reapply.
5.0,"This is very good memory for GoPro. Went with 32GB because my brother, who has two GoPro cameras, said he never filled up his 32 so why go for 64? Anyway, this is versatile enough to go in phone or camera, I ordered two more."
5.0,I was surprised at the price and quality.  It works great and have not had any problems.  I recommend this for anyone needed a Micro SD card.
3.0,I don't understand what is up with these chargers. I have bought probably 3-4 of them. They last about 3-6 months and then they don't work anymore.
5.0,What can I say. Plugged it in and it worked.Dell Venue 8 tablet.Have always had good luck with SanDisk brand.
2.0,"Had to return the product for the following reasons:  1. something is wrong with the WiFi interface. The response time is much delayed or non- existent.  My other WiFi devices ran well at the same time on the same network so it is not a router problem.  I tried to troubleshoot the device and could find no fix.  2.  I attempted to call the help line indicated on the enclosed instructions and found the number to be incorrect.  This outcome did not please me.  I'm sure Asus makes a good product but this unit (refurbished) has some issues.  I could not watch Netflix without excessive buffering and/or disconnect, and I could not even reach Kindle.  The apps that came on the PC did not work as well."
1.0,"This product lasted less than a year before it broke - The left mouse button stopped working.  I use this for a rarely used home computer, so I can imagine this mouse wouldn't hold up to daily use for more than a few months."
2.0,"JBL has been a reputable manufacturer of audio speakers for many years. I wonder if many reviews are tainted by that fact as these speakers do not follow in that tradition.  The sound quality - the reason you purchase speakers - is in a word, muddy. Since many laptops don't deliver good quality sounding speakers, a good pair of headphones makes a better investment rather than a pair of poor sounding speakers. Although well designed aesthetically, these speakers are also actually much larger than they appear to be."
2.0,"Alright I'm going to resubmit this review because I have had time to let it absorb and get used to the function of this piece of equipment. If you have an older computer and you need this type of connectivity, then you are already having problems. PS 2 and a USB connectivity is a very old technology. If you're using a computer and you need to make this switch your already going slower than I would expect and most of these parts can be picked up at garage sales and such. But if you do need to buy one because you're not willing to go and look. This will probably fit your needs easy simple does the job"
3.0,Does the job. I find the keyboards move just a little during normal typing. This means they end up slightly different alignments and locations which makes it challenging to touch type. I may play around with some sort of bridge to tie them together or maybe an anti slip mat on my desk.
1.0,"I bought this to be able to load more music into my Verizon LG Android phone. I spent hours adding music to the card. Then, I put it into my Android phone. The phone did not read anything on the memory card. The other memory cards, 8GB and 32GB worked fine, so it must be a flaw in this memory card. Also, this memory card got stuck in my Android phone's slot. I had to use a utility knife with a very, very thin blade to pull out this card."
4.0,As expected
5.0,I prefer the San Disk brand over other types.  This is a great size for phones & camera's.  I would buy again.
2.0,"I ended up returning this keyboard because I thought it would also function as a case. It makes mention of magnetic attachments that keep the keyboard snug to the iPad. However, when we received this, it did not attach to the iPad 4. Maybe other models are different, but it was not a suitable case whatsoever. It was a cool keyboard,  so if that's what you're looking for, go nutty and buy it!"
5.0,These cards are the best and a fantastic price!
5.0,"It works, fairly fast, definitely not 30MB/s fast when copying off of it via a USB 3.0 adapter, and absolutely much slower when writing to it. But that's true about all of these memory cards, it's just some are worse than others."
5.0,"I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I have been very pleased with the way these cards work in my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. No problems whatsoever and the capacity is huge.I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called &#34;Mobile&#34; Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my &#34;intermediate tech experience&#34; eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the &#34;Mobile&#34;version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the &#34;Mobile&#34; version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale!"
3.0,"It is alright for a cheap tablet but it has alot of cons I will list the main pros first..  the size..the price.. the weight.. it downloads prime music.. speakers are okey..  it works as a reading tablet for my Kindle app.. for looking things up but not working on...  you can add to its memory...  now the cons.. glares.. hard to figure out versus  a kindle... does NOT download prime videos you can't watch them at all... screen scratches  easily..you have to look at it at a certain angle or it doesn't work..so if I would have the money  I would have bought a better tablet I really  like the kindle  fire hdx that my 3 year old has better. Than this but I needed a bigger screen so tried this would I get it again? Probably not  but it's not worth returning because it DOES work it is like comparing walmart things to name brand  if you need it and don't  have the money for a tablet I would get it, but if you can live without it for a month or two longer and save to spend more I definitely  would..."
5.0,Still amazes me how small this hardware is with such a large amount of storage.  SanDisk is a leader in solid state memory.  I am happy with the reliability and speed of this product and would recommend it to anyone.p.s. The only issue I have with SanDisk is the normally high price; however I got this on sale so I am happy with what I paid.
4.0,Does the job nicely and feels solidly built too!
3.0,"Case works fine, just too large for my purposes, won't fit in my regular bag for travel.  The strips used for the stand do leave an imprint on the screen of my tablet.  It's not much but I didn't care for that and returned it."
2.0,"Set up went horribly for this unit.  The CD that came with the unit had the setup instructions in Arabic, so I had to download them off the internet.  Still took a week and a half to get the unit to work properly, and it required changing registry files on my computer.  It had worked great thought since."
2.0,I bought this case for my mom for her I pad air 2 and I don't fit correctly the you can turn the valume up or down
3.0,"It is functional but I won't be putting my phone in it. If I put my phone in it, the button will not stay clasped. If I fill it with more than a few things it won't stay clasp in general. Not what I expected for what I paid."
3.0,Not as fast as I had hoped.  Freezes up on occasion.
3.0,Can't swipe up to pull up the menu to adjust brightness. Definitely a design flaw. Besides that it works as advertised.
1.0,"Started acting erratically after about a month, it's now been a little over a month and all my files are gone. Not all of them were able to be backed up. I hope I can get at least the pictures back. Glad the S4 backs up photos automatically..."
3.0,ok
5.0,"I have two of these now, one for each laptop"
1.0,"First, this battery does not fit correctly in my laptop. Although it charges correctly, it has altered my internet connection. My previous battery which was also a replacement battery worked perfectly, but only when the charger was plugged into my laptop. I bought this battery to allow my laptop to become portable again but I CAN'T CONNECT TO WI-FI. When I try to connect to wi-fi my connection looks perfect but when I open up any browser, they state that they cannot connect to the internet. My father and my boyfriend whom are both extremely technologically savvy couldn't even get it to work! Very disappointed and will be returning."
4.0,Good motherboard
2.0,Much too heavy for carry on travel
5.0,This is a wonderful product.  I have over 100 movies on my phone not including audio.  And I still have 30gb left.  This is absolutely wonderful.
5.0,Very happy with the product and the speedy delivery. I increased my computer's ram from 1GB to 2GB. Now it runs much faster.
3.0,It's really easy to accidentally press the right button.
3.0,I have used this product for a couple of months with an SSD on Windows 7 with no problems. When I recently upgraded my PCs to Windows 10 I started having problems - the drive would periodically stop working and hang any applications accessing it. I would have to disconnect it and reconnect it and sometimes a reboot was necessary.This was happening on both a laptop and a desktop.<br /><br />I thought this was a windows 10 issue initially and tried every solution that I could find but to no avail. I finally removed the SSD and placed it in another enclosure from a different manufacturer and have not seen the problem since on either PC. Not sure if there's some chipset incompatibility but I was using the latest and greatest drivers and BIOS on both machines.
4.0,"Really like the device. Works right out of the box as does the software download need for different devices. Running with a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; 2nd generation and an Apple iPad and using the 4 Port HooToo USB hub. Great throughput and distance. No longer need to download my media to individual device in order to access it. Will be using mainly on trips beginning in a couple of weeks. Will update review once we know how it does on planes, ships and in hotel rooms."
1.0,Right after I moved all my information onto this it became corrupted and demands to be formatted. Wow.
1.0,It does't work
2.0,"Soon after using it the 4 small black pads underneath, used to prevent sliding, came off. After a year of use parts of the cover have cracked. This product is ok. For the price, you get what you pay for."
1.0,Falls apart rather quickly.  Felt bad for my kid as this was her only charger. Took a few days to break.
4.0,Great keyboard; works with Asus ChromeBox OpenElec configuration. It allows me to dual boot to either ChromeOS or Kodi.<br /><br />Very responsive and like it. Would be great if it was backlit.
4.0,"this is nice, its weighted to prevent it from moving but i found that it still does if you have heavy cords in it, i recommend that you get some command strips to hold it"
4.0,"SanDisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at times.You'd think that online prices would be more affordable. It can be but you can Not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot not.The one I received was genuine. Any of SanDisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so I've not had a problem in exchanges with the company **knocks on wood**!The 32gb version works well with Android tablets but not the 64gb versions so beware. I did read online at other forums that the 64gb version works relatively well, though, with Android phones, which is weird.Why would it work on the smartphone but not the tablet?Prices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around."
1.0,I do not like the Kindle Paperwhite. It is way too complicated and so much harder to use than the original Kindle that I had. The usage guide is a book in itself.  All of my books that were on the old Kindle did not transfer to the new one. I wish I could have just had my old one repaired.
4.0,This rating is based on multiple years of use of this memory card. Its reliable and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a memory card for long term use.
1.0,it broke in 2 days
4.0,"They arrived with the plastic packaging unsealed, but i have run into no issues. I plugged them up, booted up my computer, and voila. It recognizes 8gb."
5.0,"its a sandisk, cant go wrong. i use it for my gopro and it dont skip a beat. i have 2 of these and they write data fast."
5.0,"fast transfers and retrieval of data on phone, especially video shooting. very easy to find becasue of color difference, all black seems easy to misplace of trading out to adapters and such"
3.0,"This device is a great value for the money. The battery life is excellent (around 6-8 hours), the keyboard and mouse are serviceable if not spectacular, and Chrome OS is very easy to learn and greasy-quick for start-up and restart times.<br /><br />My complaints, which are mostly undone by the ridiculously low price, are these:<br />The video processing is minimal. Gaming is not an option, and even Youtube videos struggle on full screen in HD. Use this for email and Drive, not fun.<br />Office and Drive programs still do not play nicely together. Be prepared to have formatting issues when uploading and editing documents.<br />The Chrome Store covers the basics, but is limited.<br />One USB port on the back is annoying. A second would be welcome, especially for plugging in external hard drives (very low internal memory, helped by Google Drive, but still.) or peripherals.<br /><br />A three star review to me is fair for this computer. I like it, especially at the price tag. It saved me as a college student who suddenly found himself down a laptop and needed something economical to finish school. It covers the basics, Chrome OS has its high points, but I would not recommend it as a primary device unless price is the deciding factor."
2.0,"Absolutely awesome looking, colors are bright and the mouse is really sleek.  I'm not sure if I got a bum mouse or what, but the wireless connection kept dropping on me. I eventually switched back to a corded mouse."
4.0,Great idea for an adapter. First purchase did not work but the customer service was quick to replace the product with a functioning one and it has been working ever since.
2.0,"I bought this item,. When i open the box and try to charge it.. It didn't work and it says  it's uncharged... So the plug is not working and i need new one, can you tell me what should i do!!"
4.0,"Really good value, and works as advertised!"
2.0,"I've had this keyboard for several months, and use it quite a bit (about 45 hours per week). I got it because so many blogs reviewing ergonomic keyboards chose this as their #1 pick for people who spend lots of time on the computer, and who get fatigued when working with standard style keyboard and mouse. Some of the keys are great and feel great to type on, however, I am giving 2 stars for this rating just because of the clunky, loud, cumbersome space bar and 'enter' keys. Otherwise the layout is great when you get used to it, but I find the clunky keys so distracting that I am shopping for a new keyboard."
4.0,"Doesn't have an indicator to show the actual charging, but it does it's job charging"
5.0,"I've never had an issue with sandisk memory cards, and likewise.  Great price for what you're getting, memory is getting cheaper, and speed isn't a huge issue for me for smartphone use, so this was ideal.  Can never go wrong with sandisk."
5.0,"I bought this as an expanded/backup memory for my tablet (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3), and it installs easily, works quickly, and even has a great SanDisk memory app that helps me organize my files and see a visual representation of how much memory is taken and how much is free.It came with an adapter so I can plug it into my computer to transfer files if I want to, which is awesome.  Nothing bad to say about this memory card!"
2.0,"Seems like a great product. Had top notch packaging and presentation. However, the mousepad itself is lacking value to me. I have a razer deathadder and I noticed that the mousepad interferes with the tracking. due to this I may be returning this item."
3.0,"This is a nice screen protector. It's cut very precisely and fits the tablet very well; because of this it's a little more difficult to line-up with the screen without overhang. However, if applied properly it is very inconspicuous and looks great. The anti-glare properties are very disappointing. The protector reduces glare but not enough to make the screen significantly more readable under direct light; reflections are still very noticeable with this protector applied."
1.0,does not work with above board USB 3.0 ports. Error code from computer does not have enough power.<br />external power source should be required with this product. You should learn from outher peoples mistakes.
3.0,It does the job but I don't think it charges super fast...
3.0,Overall my daughter likes the back pack.  Shipping to get it here from China was about 4 weeks though.  The only real complaint is that one of the dual zippers was installed backwards.  The zipper opening works so long as you do not move the one zipper.  I would have exchanged it but she needs a back pack to protect her Chrome Book for school and an exchange would have taken weeks to get completed.
5.0,Used in Samsung Galaxy S III phone. Formatted in the phone. Has worked perfectly so far. A very economical storage card. Faster than previous cards I have owned.
5.0,Worked perfectly in Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 with no additional formatting. Seems as fast as the internal memory of the tablet so no need to pay for more than 16 gig in the tablet if you buy one. Adds 64 gig of storage for less than upping the tablet to 32 gig. Fast shipping as always with Prime.
3.0,"It worked right out of the box.  No missing parts or visible damage.  It came on time as promised.  It immediately recognized my WiFi network and connected without issues.  Other than the huge windows updates that came after initiation, it worked OK right away.  I primarily purchased this laptop because it still has the windows 7 operating system and the relatively fast four core AMD processor.  It could be a really nice laptop, but HP fell short on this one!<br /><br />The reason for the three stars is two fold.  1-  Although the description clearly states that it has a USB3 port, it does not!  2-  It is agonizingly slow.  I would have returned it primarily for reason #1, but I really needed it for work and could not wait for the return and replacement delays.<br /><br />On the positive side, it has a nice keyboard, well functioning track pad and a nice display when you look at it straight on.  It has very little tolerance for off angle viewing.<br /><br />It claims that there is a user replaceable RAM slot.  But I don't dare open the back because it does not have a separate opening for access to RAM and the hard drive.  Adding a second RAM and updating the HDD to an SSD would probably make this a more usable laptop.<br /><br />Bernie"
5.0,I have a couple of these and have had no problems with them at all.  They seem to be fast and supply the full advertised memory capacity.
5.0,good quality
2.0,"Purchased with a wireless security camera, but would not work in the camera as advertised. Put to use elsewhere but not good for the application it was bought for"
1.0,After 8 months it no longer works.  I would like another or a replacement.
3.0,I've had this for six months...the screen seems to be getting a bit of a short....otherwise great! Great battery life...great backup to my Mac...UPDATE I'm on a year and the screen has pretty much shorted out...I could open the lid about 30 degrees otherwise the backlight would turn off. Not sure what's up...
5.0,Great Hard Drive for reasonable price!
2.0,"Please be aware that Synology categorically does NOT repair these units out of warranty.  And it also does NOT provide/sell any major components (like motherboard) to any third-party including the customer, or any repair center.  So once it breaks, that's it you will not be able to repair at any cost (besides spending another $600 for the new system of course).  You can search for tons of problems people have had with their systems because of motherboard issues.  Once something like this happens you'll have to deal with less than stellar and incompetent technical support , where you will be the main troubleshooter of the system and it will take days for them to respond.  Synology might replace your entire system with refurbished one if it is in warranty, but if it is not, then you will have to shell out for another system.  Considering that their system is priced like a premium product ( the premium product prices reflect the fact that the system is upgradeable and repairable in the future), one would expect this as a given, but alas this is not the case.  Synology is currently being investigated by the California Attorney General office for their fraudulent practices.  Synology is not clearly labeling their products as not repairable after warranty expires, and also for violating (at least) California Consumer protections laws which oblige the manufacturer to provide repair and parts for a certain number of years depending on the product price, regardless of warranty applicability.  Currently, Synology is trying to claim that it is not a home appliance but purely a business-related product and that the California Consumer protections act does not apply to them."
5.0,Very nice companion for the Trio Tablet.
5.0,Works as expected! Can't complain about it has plenty of storage for pictures and videos! Will buy again when needed!
2.0,"I would never recommend these. They only work if you bend the cord until you find a spot where it starts charging then don't move it. It constantly goes in and out of charging and says, &#34;This accessory may not be supported.&#34; The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because it will charge if you find the right position of the cord."
3.0,they're uncomfortable on your ears when you wear them for more than 10 minutes
3.0,Unless your really stringent on form factor (and negligible speed) always get these with the adapter. Some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver. Always have it in my PC when dumping large files. Speed is actually a big improvement over the 32GB card.
5.0,came quick and works well with my galaxy s4. formating was simple. its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it.
4.0,"It is well made and acceptable for male or female use. I ordered the item not knowing the dimensions as I was pressed for time.<br />It is 17X12X4.  I personally would have liked it better had it been deep enough to coincide with airline measurements (approx. 8&#34; deep--not 4&#34;) , thereby allowing for more &#34;stuff&#34;.  A change of clothes, toiletries, etc. will NOT fit in this bag with a laptop.  Also, the zipper to the main compartment only goes down as far as the shoulder strap attachments on the side (see picture). I would have liked the zipper to go further down allowing for easier insertion of the laptop."
1.0,"Put that this will NOT work for Xbox slim. I don't wanna bother returning it, just be aware only works for fat 360 power supply."
5.0,This microsd card has been working fine in my Android phone for several months.  I have had no problem with speed or data corruption thus far.
1.0,it doesn't charge
3.0,just bought it and thought that it's touch screen but it doesn't
2.0,Had problems getting the protector on without any bubbles or dust getting underneath despite cleaning the HP7.....when I tried to remove the sticker that tells you which side to put on where it left paper residue that wouldn't come off and is still on there.  The smoother they give you scratched the protector as well.....I have it on there anyway but it's not what I was hoping for.....
3.0,"Works well, looks good, but oh my God is the price a ripoff."
2.0,"Some keys are already wearing out and not functioning till you hit them really hard.<br />No cover on to and the iPad slips off the keyboard even though there are some magnets to hold it in place but since there is no cover, both the iPad and keyboard never stays together in the bag.<br />The bottom of the keyboard is getting scratched because there are no pads/ protection when you keep the keyboard on the table/ desk.<br />Connectivity is good and it takes less than a second for iPad to find the keyboard once it's paired properly. Pairing was very easy and fast so 5 stars for that.<br />Looks are good but still the design needs a little more work e.g. Adding some cusion pads/ protection for the bottom surface of the keyboard.<br />Overall I am still not happy with it."
1.0,Bought two mine and a friends unfortunately mine came with a defective pen it won't work unless connected to the charger and from the reviews am not the only one. however the tablet works with my older 680s pen huion customer care simply will not respond to emails. its a good tablet for the price but due to quality control be ready to make returns until you get a good unit will update the review if customer service are able to help
4.0,"it is good ,but sometimes  just lose network no reason, then i have to reinstall it ."
4.0,It works
4.0,"a few annoyances but in general  does the job,maybe better apps"
5.0,This card is fast enough to meet my needs on a galaxy note 3. Plenty of memory for my pictures and files. No problems
5.0,Nothing much to say here. Works great and I haven't lost a single picture or video saved on here so far. Read/Write speeds are excellent.  I've been using this for a few months on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I have no complaints.
2.0,this was a flop! i was so sad because it is cool looking and the idea of it is awsom.  The working aspect of it  not so much. The repeat function on the keys would get stuck. it would do it so often I had to replace it with a old keyboard.  No lights no lcd buttons...... I know call the razer guys.  I thought yes they are gamers too they will help.  No they told me I couldn't even send it in for them to look at ??????<br />Sorry i wanted to like it but no. think twice before you do! cool looking doesn't mean it works and the is what a gamer needs
2.0,Pain to put on ended up ripping it off and throwing it away
4.0,"Nothing special, but it works"
5.0,Amazing
1.0,"This cable assembly does not pair up with female conductor the tread, sleeve doesn't have enough depth to secure a solid connection and can not have been made to meet specs for my needs. THIS JUMPER IS GARBAGE AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IT COULD BE USED FOR."
1.0,"Got these three weeks after I ordered it.  The description says 100 pcs, but all I got was 58 pcs!  Cheap product too.<br />Never again!!!"
4.0,"I bought this card as an addition to my 32 GB Galaxy Note 3. I have well over 32 GB that I use for music with scads left over for apps and movies. You may never need this much space, but some of you are like me and we WANT this much space. With my 3.0 USB the transfer speeds are very adequate. Can't wait for the 256 GB ;)"
1.0,I was hoping this would be awesome and it had potential but wound up being a goat rodeo.  When I got my FIRST one (yes I wound up getting two) it was missing the &#34;F1&#34; key.  Not a big deal since I never use it but when I called Acer they couldn't just send me the key. They had to replace the whole thing.  I never got a chance to use that one. I got a replacement about a week later and it wouldn't boot properly or load webpages.  It crashed and then wouldn't reboot and I just gave up....got an HP laptop instead
5.0,Did not do any tests but it works great in my Galaxy Note 2.  So far nothing wrong to report.  Recommended.
3.0,Bought for my original Xbox and after being on for about 30 min. It gets substantially hot.
1.0,"I'm so disappointed in SanDisk. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 phone. Worked great for the first few months. Suddenly I noticed some pictures were missing. Then it kept giving me an error that the 'SD card has unexpectedly stopped working' then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in. Now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mp3's I had bought and stored on the microsd card. In a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues I formatted the disc. Now I lost everything and it is still giving me issues. Read some similar issues from other customers, now I'm regretting my purchase. Save your money and headaches and buy something else!"
1.0,What happen to the &#34;Belt-clip holster included that doubles as a kickstand for hand-free<br />media viewing&#34;? It's really the reason I ordered this product.
1.0,Insane imput lag
2.0,My projector didn't fit the case eventhough it states it does.
3.0,"OK basic laptop for the price, but the screen quality (narrow viewing angle) detracts. This is not a good laptop for watching movies."
3.0,"Its okay, more like a toy than a laptop.  One of the problems is that the screen is too small and have to keep going back and forth to read whatever is one the screen."
5.0,"Fast transfers.  I was hesitant to buy a larger micro storage, thinking that it would be easy to damage.  This storage fits the phone perfect, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
5.0,Loaded songs for my bluetooth headset and it sounds great.  No issues so far.
1.0,It just stopped charging and I'm not the only one that has this problem. I only had this for two weeks
5.0,Does what is suppose to do.  I purchased it for my Samsung Galaxy Tablet 2 7.0.  No problems or complaints.
1.0,prevent my computer from booting up.
5.0,"The speakers are remarkably good for the price.  Now, they are not up to the standards of a $100 pair of speakers, but for ordinary computer use, they are more than fine.  I am not really a fan of LED lights, but the ones on the base of the speakers do look quite nice."
5.0,"love it, great product"
3.0,This demn tablet is just a Real Chinese product. The demn camera does not knows it's function. in fact this is third China good. Demn s***
4.0,Fast shipment. Just what I needed.
5.0,"Awesome case, just what we needed to protect the Fire HD from the kids :)"
1.0,Didn't fit
5.0,"This is a great product that arrived quickly and is very easy to use. I had no problems putting the screen protector on my 4th generation Kindle Fire HD. Just make sure that you get the correct style for the Kindle you have. When you look at the order screen, it will show several types of Kindles and how to tell them apart so you purchase the correct style. I also like the fact that I got a five pack of the covers. Now I can change them as needed, although I've found in the past, this isn't necessary very often. An added bonus is the fact they offer lifetime protection and will replace the covers and send new ones as needed. I recommend this product based on ease of use, quality, and warranty. You won't go wrong with this product."
2.0,"The nexus doesn't really fit in it very well - it is really crammed in there. The corners have velcro on the back so they are adjustable and they are all slightly outside the &#34;frame&#34; of fabric. The nexus is a little too wide and is bending them out, too. It also isn't easy to zip up, one of our kids broke off one of the gigantic zipper pulls already - less than a week after we got it. It would be a better fitting case for anything smaller than the Nexus 7, I have no idea why they are selling it that way. It does seem like it would protect the tablet if it was zipped up and so far it hasn't popped a corner so I don't &#34;hate&#34; it, it just isn't something I would recommend or buy again."
3.0,"Looks great, but keeps peeling off aftervwecapplied. It's been on there for a day and on the same day, it started to peel. We even cleaned our console and dried it before we put the sticker on..."
1.0,I've had this since July and it has already broke- the clip aspect broke off completely.
3.0,"I chose this item because of the speed of the memory and also because of the SanDisk brand and I wasn't disappointed.  The memory works fine in my Motorola Razor-M cell phone allowing me to store movies, pictures, and music that I can play on my phone.  The adapter, on the other hand, feels flimsy and fragile.  I had trouble inserting it into two different readers and even then it felt like like it was going to break.  I have several other adapters and this adapter feels like the material is much thinner than the others.  Having said that, I didn't purchase the memory for the adapter I purchased it for the speed rating and compatibility.  All things being equal I would consider purchasing the memory again."
3.0,"Ok.. I purchased 4 of these in late. They work well, I had them on 24/7 under pretty heavy loads, no issues just plug them in and go. Now it is Aug 2015 by this time 3 of the 4 have failed. Out of warranty of course.  All with the same simptoms. I should have trashed the first 2 but for some reason I just labeled them as bad and put them on the parts shelf.<br /><br />In a past life I was an electronic tech and when this last one went, I decided to take a look at them since each one seemed to fail in the exact same way.  The first 2 within weeks of each other. They just simply stopped working all the standard port lights were out. But the 2 SFP and the power light were on solid. A recycle of the power (unplug - plug) did not change anything. This made me think it had to be a common component that was failing and I might be able to eyeball it.<br /><br />Clearly they were not production quality and never could be trusted again but maybe they would be good in a pinch if I needed a switch but did not have a good replacement on hand.<br /><br />Once I opened them up, what I found on for all 3 of the failed switches was that there were bloated capacitors on the power supply(PS). So I took a look at the output of the PS on one of them and it was 4.3vdc but the PS was labeled as 5v. I scrounged up some replacement caps. and replaced them. It was pretty easy to do, just desolder the old caps and put in the new ones of the same or better ratings. I put them in and tested. All fixed up.<br /><br />Next I ordered a few more caps from Amazon. [[ASIN:B00CD1ECYO Bluecell pack of 20, 16V 1000uF 105c High Temperature Radial Leads Replacement Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitor]] and fixed the other 2.<br /><br />You can see in the close up of the PS where the 3 closest Caps are all bulging at the top. and the ones in the back are flat. That is a sure sign of a cap that has seen better days. The other pics are just a good look at the inners of the switch. Note there are no fans. I also include 2 pics of one of the bad caps I removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone that might be thinking of purchasing theses. Or someone that has had a similar issue.include 2 pics of one of the bad caps I removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone that might be thinking of purchasing theses. Or someone that has had a similar issue."
1.0,it is very hard to used it
1.0,"Did'nt like this computer it was very flimsy, the mouse pad did'nt click with ease and took a few taps instaed of just one to navigate, so I returned it and Amazon made that process so quick and smooth I was very impressed with the service, I have bought other laptops thru Amazon that I love such as my Google Chromebook"
3.0,"The package arrived on time, it's very well packed and it's got an adapter. It works perfectly with my phone, though it doesn't allow a computer format, once it's been on the phone, so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer. So if you're planning on buying this for different purposes and devices, gotta be aware of this. I just need for my phone, so I transfer files with my usb cable, that works just right. I also give it a 3 star because it says there are 64gb, but even when it's totally formatted it only reaches to 60gb..sooo, I don't know where my other 4 gb are...anyways, overall it's working well. I do think it's expensive for what it is."
5.0,"I love this Micro SD because I used it as my main memory phone mostly because the Galaxy S4 it comes with a 9GB of free space. So I can pretty much just enjoy this Ultra 64GB for Music, Photos and Movies but not for Apps because my phone is not compatible with moving apps to the SD it stills works for other phones but not this one. I have to say this is one of the fastest Micro SD I ever bought recommended a lot."
1.0,DID NNNNNNNNNNNOT WORK
4.0,"This is the 4th or 5th Toshiba HDD that I've owned, and I've had very good experiences with them so far. This unit replaces one that went bad from an electro-mechanical fault (hey, that can happen to anyone). I chose it instead of replacing my original Toshiba as this one came with a 2 year warranty for the same price as the 1 year warranty.<br /><br />Out of the box experience was typical of Toshiba's knowledge of how people and machines interact. It can do everything for you, including setting up a very easy backup routine, or leave you free to install the drive into your system using whatever system you use. As I favor a cloning solution, I need the flexibility that a blank hard drive brings; a ten second Quick Format took care of placing my 'solution' onto my new hard drive.<br /><br />Given that the new drive serves as a clone backup, file transfer rates varied all over the place, from 150 Kb/second for copying thousands of very high resolution photographs, to cruising at close to 19 Mb/second for generic text files. Throughout the cloning operation the drive never felt warm, running a pretty constant 37° C compared to the internal HDD @ 42° C. The included USB 3 cord is definitely short, being long enough to reach from the top of the drive over and down the front and into a USB 3 hub stationed next to my Acer Aspire 111-E3 ultraportable.<br /><br />Good flexibility, available software tools & cloud storage, a 2 year warranty (twice the normal coverage), and the lowest price for a 1 TB drive I found on Amazon, equals a good bargain. I took off one star for the very short USB cord and the difficulty of getting into the box (a royal pain, requiring cutting). Overall, a very satisfied customer."
4.0,"I bought two, one works perfectly, adding 4 extra SATA on my home NAS; one was DOA but I got refund immediately."
2.0,"After going through 2 expensive type covers in 2 years with my surface pro, I decided to purchase this, hoping it would be sturdier, plus it's actually cheaper than the regular price type cover. And it has the battery option.<br /><br />But it seems a questionable benefit. As others have noted, the right and left click buttons are practically un-usable, you have to press so hard to get them to work.<br /><br />But the troubling thing is that the type cover battery seems so unpredictable. The first few weeks, it seemed to work okay. But then, I would find it going from a full charge to completely draining itself and the surface pro battery overnight, when the device was supposed to be sleeping. Sometimes I would find it hot to the touch, and the surface pro on.  At times the surface pro battery is so drained, that it can't reboot even when plugged in, and it has to be charged for a day, and go through numerous &#34;repair&#34; cycles.  This has gotten worse since I installed windows 10.  I'm not sure if the two are related, but basically, I can't leave the power cover hooked to the surface pro when the device is meant to be sleeping, because even though all the power settings are properly set, the device will turn on by itself and drain the battery overnight. If I shut down the computer and detach the power cover, then I can unplug it, otherwise, not.<br /><br />I've read all the reviews and see others have noted this issue, that the battery comes on and becomes super hot when the device is supposed to be off. I haven't yet called Microsoft about this, If anyone has any suggestions, I'd welcome them.<br /><br />Otherwise, as a type cover it's okay, except for the terrible track pad, click buttons.  What I find frustrating about this cover is that these devices aren't cheap, the type cover and power cover and AC adaptor aren't cheap, and yet, I've gone through no less than three AC adaptors in less than 3 years and am on my third keyboard cover.  NEver had to replacean AC adaptor on a laptop or tablet before.  Never have had to replace even one keyboard on any laptops in a couple of decades. So hard to understand why Microsoft can't build quality accessories, and also why, given the accessories are so poor, they cost to much to replace.  I got the surface pro because I wanted something to replace a Dell 9&#34; mini netbook, the form factor with something faster. The Pro is faster, but so buggy, and goes through so many accessories that I'm not inclined to replace it with another Pro.  A reason why Microsoft should perhaps either make good accessories, or if they are throwaway, price them accordingly.  Even that doesn't cover the annoyance factor of having to replace them, and then, when you get them, not having them work very well."
5.0,Works great. No problems whatsoever.
5.0,thank you
2.0,"I am on my second one now and need to replace it again.  The rubber feet have come off and when two comes off from the opposite corners - the laptop is wobbly when you set it on any flat surface.  Further, I have never dropped it and the corner crack and small pieces fall off - leaving very sharp edges.  I am going to look at another brand for 1/2 the cost.  Lost out on $50 here with the purchase two."
5.0,pretty good! had a hiccup then they were pretty helpful and fixing the problem! used for my go pro and works freaking great!
1.0,"Within a week, the rubber ear pieces came off and there is NO way to attach them back on.  Very disappointed."
4.0,OK it works like it is supposed to.
2.0,"This was a very good card while it lasted. I had it over a year and the middle fan decided to start making a loud noise. FIlled out the warranty info and decided to send it in. WORST IDEA EVER! They not only told me due to shipping damage (The outside corner of the box was dinged very slightly,but I had air shipping pockets inside, plus another box) that they would no longer honor the warranty, but also that the warranty of 3 years was now null and void!!! Gigabyte should be ashamed of how poor their customer service and warranty department is!!!<br /><br />The fan would have cost them max of $5, yet they chose the low road and not to help a very simple, easy warranty claim.<br /><br />I was previously a huge fan of Gigabyte, but now I'll stay away from their products like the plague. They might say they have great warranties, but the reality is that they will figure out a way to not fix your product and blame it on shipping or worse, you!!!"
1.0,"spoke with customer service had it replaced 3 times, card had problems all of the times, they were all the time looking for ways to get out of the warranty until they decided i did something which obviously wasn't the problem because it happened 3 times with the previous cards, basically look into other companies that honer their warranties,very sad usually very good cards,they kept saying that Samsung updated the software and they update it in ways that it wont match the Sandisk cards.??"
3.0,"This fixed our problem but arrived with a banged up carrier and chipped system board corners. We were unable to do a drop in installation because of the bent motherboard carrier, which required us to remove the system board from the metal carrier and swap out the metal carrier with the one that was in the dead server. We had to replace the button CMOS battery (not a big deal) but this did work flawlessly after installed."
2.0,"I have had the 32gb in my Galaxy S3 for almost three months and there were no issues. However, the phone just recently started telling me the card has unrecognized files or it is empty, causing the loss of my media. I chose to format it after seeing the error for too long, chalking it up to some random error. Somehow, yesterday, all of the files on my card magically reappeared and I was able to play my music again, despite having had the phone format the card. Shortly afterwards, the error reappeared. I put the card in my computer and it is simply not appearing. Shame, but I think this is a risky card to purchase."
3.0,It does rip videos unfortunate not very good quality.
4.0,Easy to install
5.0,So far I definitely recommend.
1.0,"This device has limited functionality and its use is far from intuitive.  Many apps available on other tablets simply are not available on the Kindle Fire.  If you consume Amazon content and Amazon content only, then this device is fine. But if there is any other type of content you wish to consume--even if there is an app for it on the kindle fire, you'll find that it runs poorly and with difficulty.  I am returning this purchase and do not recommend it. Spend the extra money on a device that works. You'll be glad you did."
3.0,The keyboard cover stopped laying flat on my keyboard long ago and the purple has faded quite a lot.
3.0,"There were hiccups on the initial setup. The AP would reboot every couple of minutes. I considered sending it back then, but decided to update the firmware and try some other settings. It has now been stable for a couple months and we love that it covers the whole house!<br /><br />I chose this model because of the price and POE (Power Over Ethernet) support. I just had to run the single Cat-5e cable to my closet in the middle of the house and that cable carries both data and power from my basement office.<br /><br />Update 8 months later: still using the AP on POE. It hasn't rebooted on its own anymore, but I occasionally (once or twice a month) have to reboot it manually. I still think it is worth the price, but wish it was a bit more reliable."
4.0,I purchased this Wifi range extended to extend the range of my home wireless network out to my barn to setup several wireless IP cameras. It was very easy to configure and setup on my network. After following the instructions the device appeared in my network and I was able to connect my cameras to it just fine. Before I installed the extender my cameras were unreachable most of the time. They have now been connected and streaming video for more than 24 hours without a problem. Also now my cell phone gets a much better connection to my network when I'm at the barn.
2.0,"I own a Kindle 2nd Gen and the Kindle Fire HD.  After having them about a year they stopped charging properly.  I have to hold the charger a certain way to get any charge.  It first happened with the 2nd Gen and I thought it was strange, but figure I had inadvertently done something to cause this problem.  I received the Kindle Fire HD as a replacement the next Christmas and after about a year, I'm having the same issue.  I have replaced the chargers and still the same issue. One of my co-workers expressed having the same issue with her Kindle and I told her what I do to get mine to charge. When I contacted Amazon they wanted to give me a discount on the purchase of another kindle....really, why would I purchase another Kindle when the first two have the same issue that you can't explain."
2.0,"I like the fact that the tip is replaceable, but the stylus is kind of small in my large hand. The two piece connection comes loose at times, and I have to make sure the ball end is tightened. But it beats the alternative of constantly purchasing a new stylus (talking about other brands) after the tip starts to tear.   I have found that the Targus stylus is much better."
3.0,"had to send it back to SanDisk.  They did replace it at no cost - which is nice - but still ... if I had lost a bunch of data I would have been pretty bummed.  I used it in my phone to store music.  one day i turned on my phone and it said &#34;can't read card&#34;  that was it - i tried putting it in my computer to reformat, wasn't even recognized as a drive at all."
5.0,"I bought this to replace the 32GB microSD I had in my phone that up and died on me.  This one is still kicking, so I guess that's a good thing.  It's been about 6 months and all is good."
4.0,Turned my computer into a projector.
3.0,"Perfect travel companion for your files and laptop bag. It's a very sturdy nylon and you can tell it's quality. It's wide enough to fit all my files and cords. The front pocket is great for the extras and the handles have a good grip. My only thing is the very sad shoulder strap. You would think after seeing this bag that the shoulder strap would be as good as the rest of the product but it's flimsy and digs into your shoulder because it can't hold the weight. Also, we don't need to see the name brand smack dab on the front. That cheapens the product making it seem like it was a free give away at a convention."
2.0,"I've had these cables a couple weeks now and you have to place them perfectly and DO NOT bump them or they stop working. For the price I wasn't expecting rocket speeds or anything, but I did expect them to work."
5.0,It does the job without any issue. I use it on my Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet. Fast and reliable. I would recommend it.
5.0,Everything is fine I gave you this review before please do not torment me with another request for a review thank you
4.0,"Sound quality is OK but not great, so it is really important that I place each speakers<br />at the right place to feel the surround sound. I think it worth the price."
2.0,"I have bought, and intalled many screen protectors and this one by far was the hardest to apply. There were many bubbles. Although the video Mr. Sheild provides tries to help you get rid of the bubbles, I found theire tecnique actually caused more bubbles.<br />The tecture of the screen protector is very nice and if you are better at getting rid of bubble than me I am sure it would look sleek."
3.0,Love the concept. Customer service great. Design variation of one pictured and colors much lighter and pastel-y than picture displays.
1.0,Lenovo T440s would not recognize the added memory. Returned it with no issue from Amazon. Purchased Crucial brand and it worked fine.
3.0,Nice product and does what it is suppose to. Only problem I have with it is that it's hard to plug charger and headphones to it.
3.0,Does not clock properly with Asus P8H61-M
2.0,"The item arrive in time, but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation. Further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors. Refund is progressing without a hitch however, so not all was lost."
4.0,I have bought it for around 6 months. It works good so far & both read / write speed meet the described specification.
2.0,"Operated flakey, I replaced them with the cables that came with my Asus mother board, which worked better than these (!!)."
2.0,"Worked well enough while it was working.  However, it died just after a year of use.  Conveniently just after the warranty was up."
5.0,"With that said, there has been some skepticism related to the serial number of the card as it is displayed on Amazon. I can confirm that I received a brand new 64 Gb card with the serial SDSDQUA-064G-U46A."
4.0,"Bag of good quality, though a bit more than I expected"
5.0,A fantastic discount and remarkable value for a name brand product that would cost three times the amount that I paid
1.0,Write cache module failed shortly after install.
3.0,"than i expected. I don't know if it would kill any manufacturers to actually have a memory card or stick or device to actually HAVE Available the advertised capacity. Fortunately l learned that the advertised and actual available memory are TWO SEPARATE THINGS before i bought it, always scroll down and read the technical spec of a device or anything before you buy as that way ideally, your actually informed. Let the buyer beware, is more appropriate every day as most things are not exactly as they seem. And if it's food and cheap, it's likely cancer causing and don't feed your body and your car in the same place."
5.0,as expected
4.0,great
3.0,works as good as the rest.
2.0,The power connection and device seems a bit finicky.  I no longer plug any storage devices on here because they tend to randomly disconnect and reconnect instantly from my machine when they are used through here instead of directly.
1.0,"After 3 Kindle Fires I bought a Samsung tablet and discovered that the on/off button does not break, it does not lock up, it does not prevent you from watching videos other than Amazon, it is much faster and it is cheaper! Whatever you do: do NOT buy a Kindle!"
2.0,Great for kid only! To slow for adults.
2.0,"This tablet case is great unti it breaks. My third one just broke. The plastic corners that hold the tablet in are either too thin or made of cheap stuff. They invariably crack and the tablet starts to slip out of the case until a second one cracks a well. My tablet leads a cushy life. Never used by children or thrown around. It just sits on my couch, in my lap or on the end table. I won't buy another Fintie. Im tired of giving them 25  bucks every six months."
3.0,"I live in a small house with few walls. Signal is strong in 2.4 but weak on 5ghz, behind a single wall (2-3 bars of 5). I am a gamer an i was surprised by the lack of any QOS rules or setting on the firmare and it cant be replaced with ddwrt. i am thinking on purchase another brand."
2.0,Mouse is jumpy and I could not get it to work on anything but a white mouse pad.
2.0,"I was given this Kindle for my birthday. Excellent for night reading, but here are my difficulties.  I own a Kindle Touch, for about four years, love reading it, needed more light. I have difficulty with the home page.  Where is a simple table of content, displaying the titles of my books? Instead I am looking at grey covers of the books I am reading and have difficulty reading the titles, grey variations on grey, not easy. Just give me the printed list of titles.  Also the ads, they are displayed on almost half of the lower screen, not elegant, too busy and really? With my older Kindle the ads were interesting and non intrusive, not listed with my book covers that I am currently or queued for reading.  Quite disturbing when asked by children, am I really reading that? I wish I had seen the format before asking for it for my birthday."
4.0,IT&#34;S KINDA CONFUSING. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET FROM THE PAGE I'M READING TO THE KINDLE STORE
1.0,This honestly is not worth buying. It doesnt snap onto the computer well at all and breaks way too easy.
3.0,"Worked really well with daily use for a year, then the zipper broke."
2.0,"I ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week/weekend.  I began loading some files (music, videos, pics, etc).  The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren't any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.  I have 2 more to test.Very dissapointed because I was a fan of the Sandisk Ultra series for being reliable, but I guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit.  I would have been extremely upset if I used these cards for anything important."
1.0,"Very Very Hot, not using don't need my house going up in flames!"
5.0,I got this for my new phone. It works as expected. I don't worry about the speed in these things. I loaded up all my music on it & my phone stores my pictures on it. So far I have not had any issues with this micro sd card.
4.0,It is a memory card. It works and gets the job done. Hasn't failed on me yet *knock on wood*
5.0,"Bought this after verifying with Plantronics that this dongle will work with Voyager Legend  (primarily for Lync usage), This can save you $$ because the one listed for Voyager Legend specified dongle cost you over 50$  Works good for ~30 feet range (blue tooth standards).  If the dongle is powered on by the computer before switching ON the blue tooth head-set,  it requires removing the dongle and inserting it again for pairing.<br /><br />BTW...Plantronics Voyager Legend blue tooth device is the best suited for BT device for long hours of use at work place."
4.0,I love this case other than the front door on mine doesn't clip in all the way but its good enough Great case to work in.
3.0,2 products have changed two was problematic.
1.0,WAS NOT ANY GOOD!
1.0,"The things a piece of crap. Low quality, not worth the price at all. I haven't been able to use it at all because it won't stay synced with my Xbox for longer than 2 seconds before it tries to sync again and it does that constantly"
3.0,"The clamp that holds onto the side table or bedside is not as recommendable, good thing I accidentally bought 2. The adhesive to the pad came off."
5.0,I had no problems with the memory.  They are exactly as described that even my 15 year old was able to install them.
4.0,Good for an inexpensive mouse
5.0,Very good
4.0,A little bit heavier than I thought it would be.
2.0,"This is not a Samsung cord like I thought it was and that was advertised! This cord is very short, I have to sit next to an outlet while using it. However it does what is intended and that's charging my laptop. Cheap price, but for $1 more I could of gotten a 25in cord"
4.0,Good cover but shows dirt/ dust marks easily
4.0,"Once you get over the HUGE hurdle of getting these things connected right, they work really well. Documentation is BAD, but there are others who have struggled through it before, so if you're having problems read the reviews and get some ideas. Once you get it working the way you want they are solid cameras.  I am using iSpy Connect (it's free) to handle all of my alarms and recording. Here's how I got the cameras to work: Pop the disk that comes with the camera into your computer, go to Software&#62;IEActive and install the General_IE exe. (Unfortunately this also installs their security program NetSurveillance, but you can uninstall later) Once that's installed make sure your router is using a 192.168.1.XXX network. Open Internet Explorer (will not work in any other browser) and go to 192.168.1.10. At the top right is your language selection. The username is &#34;admin&#34; and the password is blank. (You may need to adjust your ActiveX settings) At the top of the screen you can change all the settings you want under DeviceCfg. To adjust the image quality change the settings on the RIGHT under Encoder. (Change the IP address LAST, if you set to DHCP, check your router to see assigned IP) Once you have it configured how you want go into iSpy and choose Add&#62;IP Camera With Wizard. Set the camera as an Empire ESC 4, then enter the username (&#34;admin&#34; by default) and the password (blank by default) and channel 1. Next type in your IP and use port 554. Select no to scanning for more feeds and choose the URL listed. It should be an FFMPEG (H264) at URL: (No Password) rtsp://admin@IPADDRESS:554/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=1.sdp?real_stream--rtp-caching=100 (Password: myPW) rtsp://admin:myPW@IPADDRESS:554/user=admin&password=myPW&channel=1&stream=1.sdp?real_stream--rtp-caching=100 If you happen to lose the password you can email the seller back and forth for a month like I did. (Their English is a little rough) Or you can send me a message and I'll sendyou the password reset program.  I hope this helps.  Pros: Inexpensive Good picture quality Solid unit  Cons: Setup Setup Setup"
4.0,"This is, as the name suggests, a Basic no-frills four port USB 2.0 HUB, at a very good price. It is well constructed, and functions well. It lacks a separate power source, which may affect your charging time for phones, tablets etc. depending on your computer, but for additional ports for keyboards mice etc., it's fine. It has a single &#34;on&#34; light when plugged in to the vomputer, but not individual lights  for each device you plug in. It comes with a permanently attached cable with a standard USB plug to plug in to a port on the computer, and four (4) ports for plugging addition devices into the hub. The whole thing seems solidly built, the cable is firmly attached, and the ports feel snug and not loose for avery thing I plugged into it.<br /><br />Pros: Well built, does it's job, and is affordable.<br /><br />Cons: There is no external power supply, so that might be an issue for some uses, like charging phones etc.  But also means you don't have to find somewhere to plug in another popwer brick, There is only one power light, so no indicators for separate devices being plugged in. And finally, the permanently attached USB cable is short, and you can't replace it if damaged. You'll have to buy an extension cord if you need a longer one. On the other  hand, you can't misplace the cable either.<br /><br />A basic (as the name suggests) but good solid affordable product."
2.0,Charges fine doesn't like my USB port in my car for music though :-(
2.0,"I liked the look, but clasp broke about the second time I got in a car. Never heard back from seller about replacement."
2.0,Poor air flow for it's size.  The smaller model AI-MPF80A  works much better.
4.0,"I got the GM1213A as my first gaming desktop and I've been very pleased with the purchase. The specs are good for the cost, and there is plenty of room to upgrade the computer. I have recently decided to try to upgrade the computer, specifically the graphics card. The site shows it coming with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 2GB card, but apparently it shipped with a 740. Apart from that, I was also missing the two fans on the left hand pane when the computer arrived. I have spoken to Cybertron about this issue, and their tech support staff member DJ was extremely helpful with the process of getting me the fans, and talking me through the options of new graphics cards. Thanks to his support, I decided to give this computer a 4/5 instead of a 3/5, and think Cybertron should make sure that are marking the product correctly on Amazon to avoid this in the future."
5.0,"So, I was looking for a card to put all of my music on for those occasions when I have my phone but don't have my HD Zune -- which by the way is the BEST music player EVER and it's just a low-down shame they don't make them any more -- and this card holds all my tunes with about 4GB to spare. Excellent speed for music playback, excellent capacity.  Would be nice to get it in 128GB, but the price of those is simply not reasonable."
3.0,"The straps are sewn on the inside of the bag so you can't zip it up all the way when the computer is inside - strange design.  Other than that, the bag is decent given the cost."
4.0,I like it no probs. Works just fine
3.0,"Didn't work out for me.  Not clearly stated that a transmitter needed too, & didn't feel like spending more money.  Sold it on EBay."
3.0,"This is a great deal but my biggest gripe is the proprietary connection. Special cable, special port. If either one breaks the drive is useless."
3.0,Feels like a strong thick cotton material. It is a bit smaller than in the picture
2.0,"es buen producto aunque el software al principio me presentó dificultad, y esperaba que fuese más robusto, posee componentes plásticos<br />is good product but the software initially introduced me difficulty, and expected to be more robust, has plastic components"
4.0,"For $20 I can't complain about those speeds too much.  I put this little guy into a super mini MicroSD reader to stick into my truck stereo for MP3 storage.  I use a USB3 memory card reader to populate the card with music, and my truck stereo seems happy with it."
4.0,"I've used this model of intuos tablet for about 4 years now, and it has served me well. It is the smallest size, but because I take it with me when I go on trips, it is perfect for my needs. The command keys always work perfectly and it recognizes my pen pressure very well. My only complaint is that if you're like me and take it with you, be careful of how you fold up the wires. The wires can become loose and refuse to work anymore (only an issue if you don't have it in one designated area all the time, so those of you who would have it at a desk or only move it once in a while should not experience this issue). This is my 3rd Intuos 3 since I started using them because of this issue. Luckily I'm very fortunate to never have had any problems with the pen, so I'm able to find sellers like this one who sell them inexpensively for the tablet and software only. For anyone who may be wary of the low cost and think there must me something wrong with them, I can assure there is not. I received mine today and have been drawing with it almost constantly since then. It works perfectly and because I already had the software installed, it remembered my keystrokes. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone who may be looking their first tablet as it is extremely easy to learn the maneuvers and customize to fit your art needs."
5.0,great product
4.0,Thank you Amazon for showing me what type of Memory Card and Adapter that I needed. I love buying everything I need at once to use my electronics purchases.
3.0,Does the job.  Nothing functionally wrong.  The shied feels really flimsy on the around the wire and gives cause for concern on its durability.
5.0,"Works like a charm.  I originally thought this was expensive and bought an off brand card, which ended up being junk.  I returned it, spent the extra $15 on this card and it is awesome.  I have it in a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (SMT310), and watch movies, read books (pdf), and listen to music on it.  Since I travel a lot I will end up buying a couple of these, that way I won't even need to take a full size laptop with me."
1.0,I lost all my files on this usb flash drive.  I totally wasted my money on this product.  Please do not purchase this junk.
5.0,"I have tested this card in both a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone and aSamsung Galaxy Tab 3 (10.1-Inchand it was immediately recognized by both devices. As I write this review the card has been running in my Tab 3 and constantly used for over a week.Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I'll share how I use it and why I prefer these over the 64GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on these 32GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it.For my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32GB card will hold about 150 CDs, so the space savings along over the physical media is significant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs.These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it's perfect for that use.Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices I own. I can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also excellent for HD video recording. At the price point it's an absolute bargain."
4.0,The memory is fine but the adapter that it came with was useless.  I did not contact the seller about it since I had another to use.
2.0,Felt cheap. I didn't like them and plan on getting some better ones at Staples to use instead.
5.0,The ability of something so small to hold so much information is somewhat overwhelming but true.I use this one in my DOD DashCam and it works great. Highly recommend to all.
3.0,Chinese fake
5.0,"It's a memory card.  It's tiny, it works. I need ten more words to post this review. That is all."
5.0,I love the card unfortunately my note 2 does not allow app install on the SD therefore i have not been able to fully test this card
4.0,It fits the Fire HD7 as advertised.
5.0,Works great. No complaints- Does what its supossed to do.
3.0,"My use for this device is as an access point.  The manual did not provide any guidance on configuration as an AP, but I was able to muddle through it in about 45 minutes.  The bands are set for auto channel determination by default, and the 2.4 GHz frequency locks on to Channel 1.  My network analyzer indicates that Channel 14 would be the best choice.  So I go into configuration to set the Channel manually for Channel 14, and all the drop down is allowing me to select is Channels 1 through 11.  Not sure why this is, as I have the latest build."
5.0,"Perfect size for my 2 year old and now I don't have to worry so much when she plays (she used to use my HDX, which is a lot more expensive).  Perfect for little hands and I got it $30 off last week during a flash sale.  Great deal.  Although I have to contact customer service as they always come with 1-year warranties and it asked me if I wasnted a 1-year warranty at checkout... so if it doesn't include a warranty, I wll knock 2-3 stars off immediately and update the review.  That wuld be a sad thing for them to have done.<br /><br />I'm glad to see the charger back included, but if the cost is losing the warranty- not worth it since any micro USB charger works and I have had about a dozen kindles and already have the chargers.  Warranty is much more important for a kids' machine."
1.0,"Battery dies, even after fully charge through the night"
3.0,"My son loved it, but I bought the leappad platinum for my daughter last Xmas and when the leappad 3 arrived I noticed how much smaller the screen was"
4.0,Fits my iPad3 very well.
2.0,I can't get on to put our password. I was on the phone with some lady who was not helpful. I had trouble understanding her. I will try to call back to get someone who has English as their first language.
1.0,I received used one although purchased new product. Previous user's configuration was left in the device and resource CD had scratches and finger prints all over. Very disappointed.
1.0,THIS CABLE DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I GOT NO AUDIO SOUND FROM MY OLDER 30 PIN BOOM BOX..
1.0,Not correct screen
2.0,I have had this modem for just less than a year. Recently found my speeds on Comcast were much lower than what I was paying for. Tried resetting modem and several other things none of which helped. I just replaced this modem with a Netgear CM500-100NAS modem and my download speeds nearly quadrupled.
4.0,The only parts keeping this from a 5 star is the instructions are horrible. Garbled English is a forte so I was okay but part of me just cringed. The other is the lack of components that were supposed to be in the package. I had the missing items left over from the phone screen protector. I'm still trying to figure out what this giant blue sticker is for...... The instructions says it is the alcohol wipe?!?!?!? It is literally a piece of super clear plastic. Takes some work to get the bubbles out but once they are gone you have to look close to screen this protector there. I'll keep it!!!
4.0,This s*** work good
5.0,not much to be said about this. sandisk makes some of the best SD cards..i have even washed mine in the washing machine by mistake and it still works
3.0,much slower charge from the charger that came with the power pack
1.0,"Very bad, in the description of the product is not indicated that only posile use in North America, I return it and waste time and money."
5.0,"I bid on a 64 gb micro SDXC on ebay which never worked to start out with and realized it too late to return.  The multiple issues I had with my newly purchased Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 was caused by the inferior memory card.  All the problems with the tablet disappeared once this memory card was inserted.  Lesson learned, any technology accessories should be purchased from a reputable retailer like Amazon to ensure quality of product."
3.0,Slow and expensive- better options out there
5.0,"I a using this card with a Sansa (sandisk) mp3 player and it is working flawless. I am glad, but I cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this, either it works or it does not, and mine is working. Anyway, I would buy one of these again without a doubt."
3.0,"Works well but has a petroleum-like smell that hasn't gone away in over a month of airing out. Don't have time before trip to test a different one, so will use and then discard."
3.0,after 3 months would not read at all. Used all sorts of card readers and computers and internals went completely dead. Strange for a product from this company but i guess it happens. May not happen to you but since it's a high capacity would that mean it's more susceptible to becoming corrupted? Would not buy again. (maybe a 16gb)
1.0,Not correct cord adapter for r33030 very disappointed
3.0,NOW SHIPS WITH ATHEROS CHIPSET. May not work with your Linux setup.
3.0,"I think it would save my keyboard from a quick spill, but it makes the keys rubbery, and for the most part, I don't like that.  I bought it simply to keep liquid out of my keyboard in case my little one were to create a mess around my Macbook."
1.0,Bought a week ago and the insertable charging piece came out of the cord and was stuck in my phone.
3.0,"It was going to take days to move over 1TB of data using Ethernet for an Ethernet device. Not exaggerating here either, it was set to 73 hours, and that's just crazy. I couldn't get this to work as a local USB connection directly to my computer to move files over either, as the built in USB port must be used to connect up other devices, not to communicate to other computers. So I saved time by connecting another USB device to the computer, backing up to it, and then backing that up to the Seagate device using it's built in USB. That's a lot of hoops to get files onto a data sharing device, but I saw no way around it versus waiting days. And that method only took about 7 hours (I walked away, so guessing here, it could have been less).<br />The built in backup software isn't the most versatile either, at least not at my first go-through of it. This works, but it's not what I would call polished. I would like to select just my music and pictures to always be backed up continuously so they are available to my other devices - you know, like a synchronized cloud backup....yeah, not so simple. I'll update if I can figure out how to easily do that."
3.0,"This product works great except for DHCP.  After configuring my own addressing scheme, WiFi and wireless devices stopped automatically obtaining IP Addresses."
1.0,"The most useless bug infested device I have ever wasted money on.<br /><br />You will spend countless thousands-of-hours to get this thing to work and it will crash your monitors, scramble your video and freeze your computer.<br /><br />Worst of all, the unit runs very hot.  So hot, that you can barely touch the side.  You have to be careful  not leave any papers or combustible material touching the side of the unit or you could have a fire at your desk."
1.0,this is for PC's only!!!! will not work with xBox or other gaming devices. This is not a &#34;gaming&#34; headphone ... its just a headphone
4.0,WD has always been my favorite when it comes to hard drives. 1 star less than 5 cause my previous one is getting sluggish after using it for a couple of years.
1.0,"I didn't heed the other reviews online that talked about the problems with this computer.  I loved it at first, but then the USB ports stopped working after 4 months.  Dell customer support were not helpful... basically just went through the usual checklist versus trying to determine the problem.  They ended up sending a technician to my house and replacing the motherboard.  It didn't resolve the issue, but we rolled back a Windows 8 update and one of the ports started working again, so we lived with it.  Now, 12 months + 21 days after purchase, the video GPU failed and we need another motherboard.  Of course, Dell won't cover the cost because it is past the original 12 months, despite the actual motherboard being only 8 months old.  I've been in IT for 22 years and have never seen a more error prone product.  Be warned - you may get lucky and have no problems... or you may be like me and waste $1500 on a computer that has a high failure rate and a bad company behind it.  Such a shame to see how far Dell has fallen in terms of quality and support.  I'll never buy a Dell again.  If you do buy it, be sure to purchase the extended warranty... you'll most likely need it."
1.0,Not very supportive on the wrist too soft.
4.0,it works perfectly with my hp g62 a13se
4.0,Great little tablet/ book holder/ stand!
3.0,"This is the second SanDisk micro SD that I've had to return due to some sort of error.  I am thinking I just have bad luck and hopefully 3rd time is the charm.During the time it was working properly, it seemed to be quick."
1.0,"This is not an EOM Cable.  When I plug my Samsung S4 into this, I get a warning message to use the original charger as the phone will charge slower using this setup.  After some testing, it appears that the charger is adequate, but the cable is not.  If I put the original cable onto this charger, it does not produce the error message.<br /><br />This vendor should be eliminated for selling &#34;knock offs&#34;."
1.0,USB ports stopped working after a few weeks...
4.0,nice
2.0,"Keyboard was used, not abused and died after 18 months..."
5.0,Worked great. quick delivery.
1.0,"This is my first from Seagate, and I doubt I will be buying from them again. Since day one it has not been working as it is supposed to; random disconnects whilst r/w, causing transfers to fail. My drivers are up to date. I have tried using different connectors, different ports, computers, to no luck. I then shut off the power saving feature on the computer and the drive, but I still get the same issue. I never had to go though the same with other brands.<br /><br />I did my research, and the issue appears to be fairly common. I have no other choice but to buy another drive and patiently transfer my data bit by bit before sending it in. How inconvenient."
3.0,"Did not fit my dell M1330 without modifying the laptop.  The original battery has a notch cut into it in the center, but this battery does not.  I had to cut a tab off my laptop for this to fit.  Not a big deal considering the age of the laptop but many might not feel comfortable doing this."
1.0,this is a joke!
2.0,Good product but the wide is shorth to computer's of 11.6&#34;
2.0,"The keyboard feels great to use, looks awesome and has extra features that are quite useful.<br /><br />However, I received and started using it on May 7th and it stopped working on August 29th. Considering that my previous keyboard lasted over 8 years, this only working for about 4 months is a huge disappointment. I did not mistreat the product or spill anything on it, the wire is still seemingly flawless, but it just does not work when plugged in. It seems as though something in the color changer is messed up, as it started to go bad a month or so ago where the backlighting colors were off. That slowly stopped working and then the keyboard's actual functionality ceased shortly after.<br /><br />The seller did offer to replace it if I paid for shipping, however I elected not to use this option as I feared receiving another defective product."
3.0,Easy to fit.
3.0,Smaller than I think. The space is quite limited.
4.0,"Not the greatest nude, a bit pinker than I thought, but accurately described. I love the Kate line of Rimmel. They are rich in color."
5.0,"Got two of these - one for our Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and one for my Samsung Galaxy Note II cell phone.  Both devices had no problem recognizing the new 64gb cards.  Couldn't be any easier to use.  Nice to have a large amount of storage on both devices.  The easy to open packaging was a real treat.  I did not use the adapters as I just connect my phone and tablet to my laptop via USB to transfer music, photos and music."
4.0,"Great sound, very comfortable to wear, and they seem to be very sturdy. My only complaint is range. While the product description says 40ft, I rarely get more than 12-15ft before the signal starts cutting in and out, more than 20 and it disappears completely."
2.0,Inexpensive and worth the price if you're careful.  They aren't the most durable though.  :( I purchased 2x and both broke within 2 months.  Compared to my galaxy tabs they're not worth it.
3.0,"Like it as a touchscreen tablet, but you can't install anything or it will become very slow."
4.0,"I loved this bag! The problem that I had is that the shipping was almost 5 weeks....<br /><br />I needed it for a trade show and had to make due with the older bag that I was trying to dump. Everyone who sees it loves it (if you are into that kind of thing) as well as being small ,compact and light."
2.0,"Bought the black matte model, it does stay on for me but it really doesn't filter enough for any scenario I can think of e.g. Plane, classroom, cafe etc. Every picture and text is still readable from a distance and at an angle, unless the brightness is turned way down. This then makes it very hard to actually use the computer. Returning this asap."
4.0,"I bought this because I needed more storage for Asus TF700T tablet and this was the largest capacity microSD card I could find. Card came preformated with the exFAT file system which is recognized by the Asus TF700T tablet and many other Android devices. The only reason I take a star off is because I can't attain transfer speeds anywhere near the 30 MB/s that SanDisk claims (I averaged around 8 MB/s which is fine for utilizing media on the tablet, but made the initial transfer of 30GB of files onto the card a slow process)."
1.0,The unit came with NO directions of use of any kind.  Don't know how to use it.  Guess I will have to buy a kindle.
3.0,"It fits, but not perfectly, the bottom part doesn't click."
2.0,It's great then it starts to chip on the edges. Since February I am on my second one and it chipping. The poor thing sits on the end table waiting for me to look something up. I would say go with another brand.
5.0,"Bought this 64gb micro SD for my galaxy S3 32gb smart phone.  Not only did it increase the size of my memory greatly,  the speed is noticeably better then the 16gb unit that came with my old DROID X smartphone.  I've put a thousand songs,  many pictures,  moved many apps to this storage unit and still have many gigs left both on my main phones memory and  memory card.  I will not purchase any smartphone that doesn't offer SD expansion,  and look forward to the next step to 128gb or higher."
5.0,Excellent light. Very bright. I'm very happy with this brand!
4.0,"I just got my keyboard protector about 20 minutes ago (a day early, so that was nice!) and I've been playing around with it. Here's what I've found so far.<br /><br />1. The cover fits very snugly. If you try to apply the cover too quickly, there will be a lot of air gaps between the cover and the keys. Apply it slowly and go key by key at first. Then it will fit like it's supposed to.<br />2. It does not affect my typing at all. I personally don't find that it is harder whatsoever to type. It definitely does feel different--the keys feel softer--but it does not feel more difficult.<br />3. The keyboard does make louder sounds as I read in a review before I purchased it. At first I thought that sounded crazy--how could a silicone cover make anything louder? But it does. I find that the smaller keys are just a little bit louder, and it's mostly the space bar and other bigger keys that are noticeably louder. This is just in comparison to typing without a cover, though. Compared to other laptops, the keyboard still isn't very loud at all.<br />4. The coloring on my backslash, enter, and shift keys is not exactly perfect as you can see in the fourth picture I included. The rest of the keys look fine, however.<br />5. The letters on the cover do not exactly line up with the letters on the keyboard. The backlight is not quite as effective this way, but it still lights the keyboard up enough to see in the dark. If you don't even use the backlight, this won't be an issue at all because the letters on the cover are clear and look nice.<br />I included pictures to hopefully give a better idea of the color of the red cover. Also, the pictures I took were right after I threw the cover on, and I hadn't yet wiggled it around to get it to fit all the keys. You can see how much air there is under the keys. If you take time and apply the cover correctly, the cover should not look like that at all.<br /><br />TLDR: Overall, satisfied with this product so far. Types well, I love the color. Four stars just because the letters don't line up exactly and I wish they did.<br /><br />UPDATE: After almost a year of having this keyboard cover, it still fits like a charm, it's still a vibrant red, and I'm still very happy with it.'t line up exactly and I wish they did.  UPDATE: After almost a year of having this keyboard cover, it still fits like a charm, it's still a vibrant red, and I'm still very happy with it."
5.0,How can you review a SanDisk card?  It works.  It stores pictures and other items on my phone.  Zero problems with it.
5.0,Was not expecting a micro 30 MB within a standard ScanDisk.  Not much to write.  Performs as it should without any hassle.
3.0,"Thought this would be a great idea, but there's too much movement from the stand when touching the screen. It's kind of like a bobble head."
4.0,Fits a little bit loosely on Asus vivotab. Pen that comes with it is actually quite nice. Overall decent case.
4.0,Works fine.  But it gets HOT under sustained reads/writes (as in backing up/copying a drive).  No warmer than any other device for routine use though.
5.0,"works like a charm...expand my tablet capacity and now I have lots of space for apps, music and videos without worries"
3.0,It works just like it should. It really does work like it should. I bought this thinking it would work and it does!
5.0,Like it!
3.0,"This protects my keys well, but turns them a grey color. It also is less-flexible than other brands I have used and thus I have to press harder to type."
2.0,Looked like it was broken
1.0,"The one I received has very sharp corners on the top of the pop out stand device that the hand strap goes through which would have cut my hand if I had gripped it hard.  Otherwise, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating.  I'll round them out with a small file."
4.0,small
1.0,"Complete disappointment. The first one that arrived was bad out of the box, would lose connectivity after a few hours. Tech support said to return it to Amazon and get another. Second one has the same issue, however it doesn't lose connectivity for 8-12 hrs, only have to reset it 2-3x per day. This one will be going back as well.<br />Range isnt as good as I thought it would be, about the same as the ancient Linksys I have."
1.0,"If you plan to use the iPad mini with headphones, do not purchase this. As several other reviewers state, the headphone jack cannot be accessed due to the thick protective edge around that area. There is a cut out for the headphones, but no standard jack would fit in the slot. We are returning this item."
5.0,"Put the memory card in my Microsoft Surface RT and it worked fantastic. No formatting, no setup, it was ready to go right off the bat, plus the price was the best I could find anywhere."
2.0,setup nightmare
2.0,I ordered this cable set based on the fact that the description insists these cables will work with Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 4; the phones my wife and I own. Image 1 shows the micro connectors as looking identical to USB 1.X and 2.x connectors. Images 3 and 4 show them plugged in to what are obviously Samsung phones.<br />THIS IS NOT THE CASE!<br />USB 3 micro b connections are nearly twice the width of the previous versions. It will not work as a charge/data cable replacement for Samsung Galaxy phones!<br />Please update the description and photos for this product to accurately represent the appearance and use.
5.0,does very good..... holds a lot of songs......
5.0,This is an excellent power cord. The quality is superior to the previous cord. If I need another cord I will definitely purchase an EZOPower cord.
1.0,"Ordered this from Amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other 32GB sandisk (in my galaxy s4). However, I was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note 10.1 2014 edition the card become unrecognizable. I tried reformatting on the computer, on the phone, and yet, no prevail. It could be the firmware or current update of android, but the point is that, if other companies can make a card that works, why not do the same? Maybe I got a bad batch, who knows...I went ahead and ordered the G.Skill microsd card and now it's working perfectly. I'm s"
2.0,It is absolutely different as state in the specification.  I bought this 8dBi to replace my 5dBI antenna but the cover range is similar. I don't know how to refund this product. I will re-think to buy any production via online.
2.0,I don't like it. There is no Power connection for the laptop. I had to find a different solution.
3.0,"The mouse works well like a mouse should. My only complaint was that when the product arrived, one of the clickers was lifted and I had to fix it in order for it to work. Otherwise it does the job!"
4.0,It's an SD card.  No one has the tools to test whether this is a Class 10 with speeds of blah blah blah.  It works and that is all that matters.
5.0,"Using this card for my GoPro Hero 3 Black.  No issues to date.  Card was used to video vacation in Palau, Yap, & Guam - underwater video.  So far, no complaints!"
2.0,"Nice and long, only lasted a few days before they stopped working."
5.0,"No complaints.  Worked in every piece of electronics I've tried them in.  I've run across fake chips online before, but these are high quality at a good price."
2.0,Definitely not what i expected i can go inline and watch the same shows with out it.. Not happy
4.0,"Received the I pad air life proof case the other day. I have one for the I phone 5s and love it. Make sure to clean I pad air front and back  and the front of the case which is a plastic piece. There is an &#34; oil&#34; coloring of sorts when tilted just right when all put together. I am not concerned because of the wall paper, can&#34;t  see the &#34;oil&#34; coloring. Reviewers have mentioned about the difficulty of the on/ off switch. I have difficulty with the off but the on is no problem. Don't know why. Even took apart case with ease ( tool is included) to maybe reposition I pad air but problem still there. The camera front and back work just fine. The volume buttons work fine, no issues.  I did have an issue with the seller. Did not receive any tracking data until the day before  it arrived. I like the case, does protect, not heavy, actually easier to handle, doesn't slip out of your hand or of off your lap. No finger prints and ports are accessible."
5.0,This is a great up grade for me. I use it for my tablet and it gives me lots of extra storage. I would recommend to anyone.
5.0,Fast and very easy to use.  Works with my GS4 and it is comparable with other devices.  Want to buy the 64 GB one.
1.0,"Works with Nvidia Shield Tablet, but became loose after one use. Waste of money"
2.0,"My new laptop came in the mail in about 4 days which was very good for free shipping, and the item seemed to be very well packaged. The thing that really aggravates me about this product is that it does not lay flat on a table, the laptop is warped so when you type on it on a flat surface the right sight close to the trackpad bounces up and down. I hope someone from Asus contacts me to resolve this issue because currently I am very disappointed that I was delivered a defective item."
2.0,The monitor came cracked in the upper corner. Therefore the screen was shot. Fortunately my son was able to canabalize the brain out of it and make our old one work. I understand these things happen but you should probably look at how these are packaged.
1.0,"The set looks great but once you unpack it, you realize how cheap it feels. And the sound is absolutely awful! The cable is way to short. I had to order an extension audio cable, but then the lights no longer worked. So we had to return this and get a more expensive speaker set. You get what you pay for!"
5.0,"I have never purchased such a well bought case. I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13.3&#34;, and it fit perfectly! Currently, I travel a lot and it has proven it's durability -- The cover's color is accurate to the picture online and doesn't accumulate dirt or oil finger prints. It is easy to snap on and remove.  This exceeded my expectations.  Will be recommending them to many of my friends."
5.0,If you're looking for a gaming headset this is the headset to get. Great quality sound with a great microphone.
2.0,Crappy. This is regretful.
4.0,"Simple, neat.  The only negative:  a little smaller than expected."
3.0,Exactly what I was looking for. The screen protector was missing when I opened the box.
5.0,"From what I've seen, this memory seems to have the best stats for transfer speeds and whatnot, but I'll let you do that research on your own, as far as the rest is concerned.Pros:The packaging was plenty to protect the product.Came with the adapter to the full size SD card (most of them do, but this is definitely nice)The price beat those that I could find locally.Cons:none really that I can think of."
4.0,Affordable
2.0,"They don't stick very well, fell off a few weeks after replaced originals."
2.0,"Kinda bulky, didn't close at the hinged end."
2.0,"worked at first ,stops working after transfer service"
3.0,I ordered this to charge my kindle faster.  I have not seen it speed the charging process.  I am disappointed.
5.0,"Good memory card, a gift given to junior partner, after receiving very beautiful, beautiful packaging, received a big surprise, do not know how to evaluate it."
2.0,"Remember you are getting what you pay for. Mine came in I hooked it up and an hr. later it overheated and died. Then I was able to get it running again, I built a special stand for it mounting it vertical and placing a small fan blowing n it. Then came the wireless keyboard wnd mouse problem. It won't recognize both of them at the same time. O.K. now I start missing things like cd/dvd read write capable desktops. Then more memory, usb connections, card readers, etc.... I should have waited. Hindsight is always 20/20."
2.0,"This mouse was ok for a while, but now is already broken.  I think it also took too much pressure to click the right and left buttons. It was ok, and the concept was good, but still has a long way to go. Not satisfied."
5.0,I bought this to change my nook to android and boot off it. It's fast and reliable for daily use.
5.0,"I first used bag balm during the 1950s when milking my grandpa's cows. Grandpa insisted that it was applied during each milking. Of course, I assumed it was only for the cows. During my 30s, I heard from a friend that it worked well for his feet during hunting. I too, had been plagued by blisters, especially on opening day of pheasant season, so I started using bag balm and it really helped!<br /><br />Now in my late 60s, and plagued by dry, cracking skin, I use bag balm often and find it is a real remedy - great product!<br />Chris Gregory, Tekoa WA"
3.0,They break easily so if you are careful they will do what you want.
3.0,"It works, but sparks EVERY TIME I plug it in."
3.0,"Great product worked pretty good for 2 years 10 months, is bought it on Aug 17, 2015 died on June 24, 2017. Kinda disappointed it's superposed to last  1000 cycles, it only lasted 141."
4.0,"Good basic webcam.  I'm using it with a RaspberryPi running MotionPie as a security camera.<br />The LED's are not Night vision infrared, they are just white lights like a flashlight.  They're pretty useless."
5.0,Way less than anything I could get in a big box store. No issues with the card this far. Would buy again and again.
4.0,"Nice board. I use it for pfsense. Only problem is that on-board NIC can't handle high speed. If your internet connection is faster then 80MB you will have inconsistent download speeds. To get around this, you can use a Intel PRO/1000 MT Dual Port Server Adapter PCI/PCI-X card from ebay. (&#60;$15) Only thing is you have to use a bigger case. I've tested this for 200MB download with no problems."
4.0,"This wireless keyboard is a great thing for home theater PCs. However, the signal strength on my keyboard was pretty pathetic. You need good line of sight from the receiver, and it won't work reliably beyond a few feet. But the price is right for the purpose, and I use it every day!<br /><br />As for the trackpad, it seems fine. As good as many laptops I've used. The buttons aren't very tactile and feel kind of rubbery to press, but you get used to it.<br /><br />The keyboard is not something you should use at your desk for typing papers and reports. Get yourself a real keyboard for some real work. This is a consumption device, not a production one."
1.0,"Didn't work properly. I ended up having to buy a different, similar product."
2.0,"They were good for the month that they worked. Now, two of the three cables have become unreliable just 5 weeks after I purchased them. You can make them work but they have to be angled just right to work. This comes after nothing but very light usage (these cables have only been used by my wife's nightstand and mine, as well). We have not traveled with the cables; we have not used them strenuously.<br /><br />Why a two star rating? They did arrive in a timely manner and I did enjoy the price. But, the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for."
3.0,"Not quite an exact fit, but it will do"
2.0,"Another of those devices where much is promised, but it doesn't deliver.  I wonder how much (if any) this device was tested to verify the &#34;198 feet&#34; claim.<br />Bought 2 of these for my company, for connecting to a data collector on a device.  No heavy data traffic, as with a webcam.  The collector merely samples temperature data every minute or so and sends it to the pc.<br />I couldn't get it to work.  The claim that it will go 198 feet is an exaggeration.  After about 50 feet the signal drops to almost nothing.  It &#34;might&#34; possibly work over longer distances if it was some very low data passing over the line."
3.0,Not as customer friendly as previous kindle HDX fire.
1.0,Bought to use with my PS3. Save your money and get something that's meant for the task. My PS3 sees the headset but the headset isn't receiving. Tested with my Samsung Note 4 and the same thing happens.
2.0,Does not work without a disc and they dont put this is in the description!  Now all this money for nothing.
2.0,"Basic shell, and while it fit well, and might keep some basic scratches off the MacBook, does nothing to actually protect in a drop.  I had a 2 foot fall off a chair onto a corner, and the back end of the MacBook Pro was bent enough that the screen no longer closed properly and the port closest to the corner was unusable.  I was actually kind of surprised....I thought the aluminum body was supposed to be stronger than that.  Anyway, this case did nothing to help.  Luckily it was cheap enough that I don't care about throwing it in the trash."
1.0,"One of the slowest laptops I have bought in years, the quad core AMD processor is slow as dirt."
5.0,"I bought this card to replace a Kingston card that my phone fried, it has been working without issues so far."
4.0,So easy to use. Great for using different drives.
2.0,I was very impressed with the device until within 4 months of purchasing the product the battery expanded several times its size and popped off the cover.
3.0,"Didn't work as well as I hoped, probably because of distance to cover.  Picture was snowy and kept cutting out so I went ahead and got a 50ft cable."
3.0,I love it so far.  This is my very first laptop computer.
3.0,Just have to learn how to use
2.0,Got a hole after two uses.
1.0,"UPDATE: The &#34;spill-proof&#34; keyboard is not. I managed to slosh what amounted to a few table-spoons of coffee onto the keyboard. I promptly turned it upside down while pressing the power button to turn it off. I left it in a tented position for 24 hours after removing the batter, etc. all the usual things to make sure it was well ventilated. Result, about three months later: intermittent hard drive failures. Repair bill: $650. They want to replace pretty much everything inside, not just the keyboard: system board, chassis and fan assembly. So, what I saved by not buying directly from Lenovo and getting a break fix warranty (relying on the shock-proof solid state drive and &#34;spill proof&#34; keyboard) was money ill spent. It's a laptop. Things happen to laptops. You are better off buying it from Lenovo directly and getting a break/fix warranty, because if something stupid happens you will have saved zero dollars. (Not too pleased with Lenovo, either, although this is my third Lenovo, and escalating over teh &#34;spill proof&#34; keyboard issue).<br /><br />Camera doesn't work. Doesn't recognize USB devices reliably.  I think these are the ones that fell off the truck or something. &#34;Genuine&#34; in the sense that it looks like a computer from Lenovo.  OEM Genuine's answer to all issues is &#34;call Lenovo.&#34; If you want a Thank Pad, don't think you're getting a bargain here. Go to Lenovo and pay the full price."
3.0,Some reason this card (and a replacement card) did not work with my GoPro Hero 3+.....therefore I could only give the card a 3* instead of a 5......ive also read that many people are having the same problem with ALL brands of micro SD 64 gb cards.
5.0,Does everything its supposed to do.  Haven't been able to really test speed in a video camera to see if its really Class 10.  Given its from SanDisk I expect everything is good.  Great price.
5.0,I use this memory card for a car DVR.  Absolutely no lag in recordings.  The DVR cannot fully use the transfer rates of a class 10 memory card but no issues with recording or sound.  Will buy again and again.
3.0,Reasonably fast tablet. Easy to use.
4.0,"Do its job, so it's cool."
1.0,"Did not want, do not need"
4.0,"I used it to upsize several SATA bootable drives. In one example I went from a 160G HD to 240G SSD, and this was done by pulling the original HD from the netbook and plugging it into the standalone box along with the inbound SSD, then pressing the button for 3-seconds to start. The box does come with a USB cable, but it is needed for the initial step. It is used for mounting one or both drives into the directory of a host computer, where one can view and use them just like any other USB drive.  As discussed by others, the new drive gets partitioned as the old one was, so I rounded up a command-line utility (DiskPart included in WindowsXP/7/etc) and extend the partition out. Note that this utility and others will not allow you to change a partition on a currently active boot drive. Therefore I wouldn't want to immediately install the new drive back into my one-slot machine. Instead the USB cable is used to mount the drive onto a bootable machine, possibly this machine with the old drive reinstalled, then extend the partition. Now we are finally ready to swap in the new larger drive permanently.  Can the USB cable be used to clone the old drive before taking it out? Yes, however two issues. First, is that if your machine's USB port is only 2.0, then its going to take awhile. For instance, I've got that 500G clone-over-2.0 job going right now that is calculated to last 9 hours. For comparison, doing this using the stand-alone configuration would be perhaps 30 minutes tops. The second issue is that this KingWin product did not come with any host application software for doing this over-USB maneuver. Instead I went and pulled a (free) cloning app off the internet. However this was actually necessary for still another reason.  Although the KingWin is great at upsizing drives, a very common need, it refuses to go the other direction. In my other example, I cloned a 500G drive over to a fresh 1T drive. Initially then, the 1T drive has the same 500G partition as the original. Now keep the 500G partition, and wipe/format the original 500G drive, and then try the clone back the reverse direction. The red light on the smaller target goes out and all four blue lights flash unendingly, which I guess (because documentation is minimal) means that we are not proceeding any further. Hence the need for (free) cloning software that can in fact yank a 500G partition off a 1T drive and send it over to a 500G drive. So long as neither the source drive nor the destination are the drive your machine has booted off of. Got it?"
4.0,It's great!
5.0,"Works GREAT ! ! ! ! 100% compatible!!! Very fast on my Asus table, highly recommended for any kind of files, specially for movies because of its speed."
2.0,"It is good for a protective case, and they keyboard works ok. But it was made very poorly. The stitching started coming apart within a week, and although i barely use my ipad, after only a couple of months the velcro stopped working all together."
5.0,Great price for an 8GB USB 3.0 flash drive
4.0,"Runs everything I throw at it. Witcher 3, arma 3....all the heavy hitters run with this. all though sometimes I have squares that form on my tv where its looks all pixilated and distorted. If the card craps out Ill not be a happy customer....since I only got it a few months ago. But running ok other wise."
1.0,its a bit to small
4.0,Excellent. Products arrived on time and exactly what I expected.
4.0,it works well thanks
3.0,"Looks great with lots of pockets.  Extremely stiff leather, so difficult to use."
4.0,Received today. Thank you !! Haven't had it long enough to write review but. Seems just what I wanted
2.0,It worked pretty well for about 2 weeks then my grandson  broke it. I didn't get insurance on it.
2.0,"It took 6 days for me to get 2 of these cards when I made the order early in the morning-normally that'll get my product to me the next evening. Not SIX DAYS LATER!Be warned, this was the slowest shipping I've had for my Paid Prime Account since I started. If you need these cards quickly, buy from a different seller."
3.0,"Happy with the device, NOT SO HAPPY with the software interface with Windows 10.  VERY FLAKEY  won't read the RPM's on it's own device, or my MSI GTX 970 vid card installed on a Asus m/b 2011-v3 Intel CPU  The fans spin on the cooler, but don't register in their software.  There is no tweaking of the setup, Everything is default in this Windows 10 setup."
2.0,Arrived with a teal stain
5.0,No issues...fast delivery.  Works as expected!
5.0,Love the mouse.
3.0,"When the mouse is linked, it works very well. But it doesn't stay linked with the operating system consistently requiring me to unpair then reboot the computer to repair.  Even then, that sometimes does;t work for several tries."
1.0,"I am very disappointed. I spent good money and other than 5 or 6 stickers, all are pretty much useless and not likable at all. I really wish we could choose which stickers we can get and not get."
3.0,Numerous issues keeping both tablets linked to WiFi and Bluetooth keyboard
2.0,"Horrible range, have to reset router multiple times, I ended up getting rid of it for an airport extreme refurbished."
1.0,"Pros: My 11 year old son loved it for his iPad.  Great keyboard.  Looks cool.  Cons: It broke after being dropped 4 times.  It lasted 6 weeks.  So, if you think you will never drop this, it's the right product for you.    PS: I contacted the seller to see if we can get a replacement.  Maybe this one is a dud?"
3.0,"Case itself fits well, easy to install, but I was very disappointed to find a logo visibly placed on the front panel (as opposed to discretely on the bottom), when there was none on the picture."
3.0,"It works, but file writes are a bit slower than expected on a USB3 reader.Also, both reads and writes are FASTER with the card inside the standard-size SD adapter (15 MB/s vs 10 write; 45 MB/s vs 22 MB/s read) on the same card reader.  Can't figure why..."
4.0,"This controller works very well. The phone holder grips my 5.5 inch phone pretty well and I'm not afraid its going to fall out if i move it around. The joysticks and buttons feel just like an xbox 360 controller, which is my preferred feel so I'm happy with that. The volume control is pretty handy since my volume controls are on the back of my phone.<br /><br />Some things I dont like are that the trigger buttons are not analog. They show up as a button in all the gamepad testing apps I tried. Not a deal killer, but it would be nice. Also, something I noticed is that the dead zone is a little big, and in some games like Geometry Wars 3, the aiming only goes to 8 points like an old arcade joystick. I'd be trying to aim precisely at an enemy, and if i only put the joystick from about 30-80% i had precision aiming, but if i went all the way to the edge of the stick it would start shooting like its aiming at the edges of an octagon. Its possible i could fix this with an app that lets you edit the sensitivity, but I don't know that for sure. Also, the D-Pad is really crappy. Its kind of spongey and I don't even feel good using it. Its crap.<br /><br />All in all, this performed good in the emulators I tried. And it works really well with my quadcopter sim. Id buy it again, but if you really need to have a good D-Pad, i would look elswhere."
5.0,"I noticed that I was constantly running out of space on my Smartphone. I checked the SD card and it was a 16Gb, but was about 98% full with pictures, music, and applications that I downloaded over time. I decided to get a bigger SD card for the phone. I researched online and found that my phone will support a 32Gb card, so I bought this one. Works great! All I had to do was copy and paste (via my computer) all the information from the old SD card ot this one. My Smartphone picked it up right away and I didn't lose anything, AND now I have twice as much room. I think the only thing I had to reset was my ring tones (because the wave files I was using were on my old SD card, and somehow the link between ring tone and file didn't match up), but other than that, everything else worked fine."
5.0,works great does what it says it will do. price has come down over the years and quality has improved. I use it in my note 3 and it does a great job. when I fill it up I put everything on an external hard drive and the card can be used over and over and over again.
2.0,"I bought this because the wifi card on my Macbook Pro overheated and rather than spending the time to open up my Macbook and replace it, I opted for a cheap replacement that should have been a quick and easy fix.  What could go wrong?  Lots, apparently.<br /><br />As the reviews mention this ships with a mini CD for the drivers (which few if any Macbooks can even run).  Not a problem because there was a link to Mediatech drivers that I could use.  However these drivers are terrible.  Even when you are not connected they display three bars for wireless signal strength and connectivity.  I am sporadically disconnected from the internet (not totally unusual) but when I try to reconnect by clicking on the wifi signal bars (which are still at 3 full bars) I get 2 options sometimes (turn on/of wifi and open wireless utility) and then sometimes just one option (open wireless utility).  When I click on open wireless utility, typically nothing happens.  Sometimes there's a screen flicker but generally nothing.  So I try all the usual things, force quit and reopen the program (it reopens but still won't work), put the computer to sleep (no help), pull the USB out and put plug it in again (nada), and finally the tried and true reboot the computer (success!).<br /><br />I came back to Amazon to look for solutions and found more up to date drivers which (after digging around on the website for a while to find, then installing, and reinstalling twice) did absolutely nothing to alleviate this problem.<br /><br />So after a week of fiddling with this thing I am here to tell you not to bother.  Maybe it's great for PCs (though I would suggest others after my experience with this one) but it's definitely failed me as far as Macbooks go.<br /><br />I get it's only 10 bucks for this thing, but devices from phones to dishwashers now have fully functioning wifi so instead I'm just going to return this and buy a burrito as a reward for my troubles for the last week.  Seriously, it had onejob to do!!  Anyway, time for a burrito."
5.0,"Don't go by the bad reviews at this price this thing is great no install just plug in the USB receiver and works on any OS (or I can say Windows 10 and 7, Linux and Ubuntu)! Great price, works great, looks great, arrived extremely fast in retail packaging that was perfect also!"
4.0,Great product. works near perfectly.<br /><br />Some apps don't run correctly or don't install entirely.<br /><br />That's my only issue
4.0,"Doesn't work with my portable charger, but that might be an iPod issue rather than a problem with the cord."
5.0,"I use this in the S2, works great, movies, pictures, passworded storage areas, everything is working fine after 6 months! Your mileage may vary, good luck."
1.0,It is not working at all
5.0,"I bought this for my camera, which had a 720p video recording option.  Everything works just fine with the card and its adapter."
3.0,Nice Case I just don't like the fact that my tablet moves so freely while snapped in place..
3.0,"received your product on time.<br />I received this product on time. I bought it based on user's review.<br />I plugged it to my desktop (just upgraded to Windows 10). This desktop use an on-board wireless card. The signal is weak (1 bar). That's why I would like to buy an external USB wireless adapter. After installing the driver and utility, scanning the signals, it can find my neighbor signals, but not mine. After rebooting a few times, and scan a few times, it get my signal (by luck). The signal is strong (96%). However, if I reboot the machine, the the connection disappear. It took me an effort to rescan signal to get the signal again.<br />When I get the connection, I have problem with the web page retrieval (E.g. yahoo.com). It takes 5 times longer to retrieve yahoo.com page comparing with my internal onboard wireless. This is very frustrating.<br />I don't know if this problem is related to Windows 10 or something else."
3.0,I wasnt in love from the beginning and the low price made me even more wary. As I start piecing together the parts in the case I'm fumbled for a few minutes and then I discover a rivet thats was placed in such an area that it won't let the power supply sit back completely against the back of the case. It does have some good wire management features. The instruction card that came with it is a little slack one page both sides really just tells you how to put the drives in the trays and into the case. The optical drive door is extremely flimsy and has already snapped off from merely using the paperclip to manually open a drive while the pc was off. The Graphics card support was useless because my graphics card has components as well as a passive/active cooling mode switch that didn't allow a fit.
4.0,"Loved the tablet, I had another brand and I really like this one so much better...the problem is, I haven't been able to use it much at all...I can't get the pen to hold the charge for more than maybe 20 minutes.  And I am not even using it that long.  I charged it when I got it and didn't touch it for the day, I was busy doing other things.  I thought having the rechargeable pen would be much better than the battery one I had with my other set, but if it doesn't hold a charge then I am thinking if I made the wrong decision.  Is this typical for this pad/pen?"
2.0,Drive quit working after being used for a month.
1.0,"I purchased this keyboard to replace my old split keyboard thinking it was ergonomically suitable to provide relief from carpal tunnel.  It definitely is not.  Though the keyboard is slightly curved, it still keeps the hands too close together to provide relief from carpal tunnel.  The side buttons on the side of the mouse which allow for navigating forward and back are too close to the top/front of the mouse.  In order to reach the front/back buttons you have to reach far forward on the mouse, resulting in awkward placement of the hands on the mouse.  I'll go back to my very old Natural multimedia keyboard.  Microsoft really missed the mark on this one."
1.0,The CH3 part fell out now I'm not even sure what chemical molecule it is.
5.0,"I purchased this for my Dell Venue 11 Pro, which effectively doubled it's storage capacity. Installation was simple and the card has worked flawlessly since I installed it. Great price, great performance, no headaches. Been going for a couple months now with no issues."
2.0,"This cover is poor quality, and does not fit the keys on the keyboard too perfectly. You still feel the edge of the rubber when typing and is not the best compared to others I have used. Not my favorite."
3.0,"Bought this on HSN and put it in the computer but 12+ hrs later still not finished so I had to stop it.  Next time I tried again and this time it took 4+ hrs and still not done so I stopped it.  This shouldn't take this long.  Update -  Contacted customer service via email and they suggested I do a factory reset which I did.  Put it back in and it took 5 hours to complete.  And it found some viruses.  I also spoke with them and they said it can take longer for older computers.  Mine is running vista.  Still 5 hours is way too long.  Strange that when I first ran it, it had to do an update so I don't get why a factory reset wasn't part of it.  Changed my stars from 1 to 3."
1.0,"The Dell Neoprene sleeves looks nice at first but when held against other Neoprene sleeves on the market it comes out pretty lacking. The cost difference with this Neoprene sleeve and others seems directly correlated to how thin this is. It may look nice in the photos but that is all there is too it. It is essentially all flash and little to no substance. The padding is extremely thin which made me feel a bit nervous slipping my Dell 2-1 laptop into this before putting it in my bag. It seems to be able to resist scratches and such but I would much rather had more padding for more protection. I would definitely avoid getting this sleeve due to how thin it is. If I had to use some unit to say how thin it is, it is essentially the thinnest sleeve zip up binder type of covering out there, you know the offbrand ones that arent from Mead Five Star etc."
1.0,The product was broken upon receipt. Actually it didn't even have the broken pieces in it so I think there is a fly in the manufacturing process. This prevented it from attaching to the air vents. I have own product like this before and I know how they are meant to work.
4.0,"Fine item, except for some cheesy plastic around the power plug that cracked on mine.  Works well as a hub."
2.0,it says for macbook pro 13 in but doesn't even remotely fit
4.0,"I love, love, love the pattern, and it fits my computer perfectly. I love the non-stick feet and the texture of the case. I only wish it was less-transparent. The apple logo is visible when the computer is on, unlike the picture shows."
5.0,bought for my go pro and i love how much info it can hold.. graet price couldn't go wrong.
5.0,Wonderful as expected
4.0,the item delivered as described! awesome.
5.0,This is a great memory card that I've put into my phone for music and picture storage.  It works exactly as advertised.
3.0,Good quality with incrediblely high price. That's the reality of apple products.
3.0,MiniUSB did not work with Motorola Razr phone
3.0,Should have gotten the one with the light.
4.0,Installation on my Surface was simple and added a lot more storage to my tablet. I liked the SD adapter so that I can use it like a mini USB drive from my larger PC.
2.0,All of the rubber pads that are on the bottom fell off within 2 weeks.
2.0,"I have not used this product, but the photograph here shows a &#34;QWERTY&#34; keyboard, and not the French &#34;AZERTY&#34; keyboard.  Wrong photo?"
2.0,Case did not last very long after I bought it. I'm an IT guy so I didn't blame it on the case at first. I removed the HD and put it in another case and the drive worked perfect so I knew it was the case. Be careful when ordering this item.
5.0,"ES UNA TARJETA MICRO GUARDA TODAS LA CARACTER&Iacute;STICAS DESCRITAS EN LA PUBLICACI&Oacute;N LLEGO EN TIEMPO R&Eacute;CORD, HASTA EL MOMENTO NO HE TENIDO NING&Uacute;N INCONVENIENTE"
3.0,"These decals were tricky to line up, and even when lined up correctly, there is no way to truly get the edges secured. The edge of the decal on the top of my computer are always slightly lifted. It functions well for its purpose of protecting the white computer from dirt and scratches, but I do wish that it were a bit better fitted to stay secure on the computer."
4.0,kind of annoying if your computer sits to your right instead of left as the cord might tangle or have to be strewn across. The length of the cord is a good thing though. The quality of the headset sounds good to me as I use them mostly for music and they deliver.  I believe this was a good buy for the price.
1.0,Not compatiable with my Kindle.....
3.0,Sound quality low
3.0,"I am a little lost at the moment. I bought this and no matter how much I google, I can't seem to find anything on the internet with the issue I have. The mic keeps turning off on me and it is randomly that it happens. I thought it was a connection issue, but the mic is secure in its slot. I checked the drivers and everything is up to date. I also do not have the option of SBX or Scout mode when connected to my xbox one, so I do not like that they do not specify at all about how it exactly works. I am contemplating returning this because it is more trouble that what it is worth. I do enjoy the sound though. Great quality"
4.0,"Large storage, perfect for tablets (using it on Asus T100, after maxing out 64GB very quickly), but maybe too slow comparing to SSD, as it's the first memory of this kind to reach the microSD format, that's an acceptable tradeoff."
5.0,very nice case for the paperwhite
3.0,It does its job as a replacement battery. Only lasts at most about an hour without charging if labtop is on power saving mode. Battery dies when at 22 percent. So really I only have about a 30-45 minute timeframe with this battery. Can't complain though. You get what you pay for.
1.0,Was very disappointed...could hardly even see the joker print on it because it was printed so small
1.0,"We bought 2 of these and they are both already broken.<br /><br />This tablet didn't even last a month before we started having issues. The screen would go black for no reason or the whole picture would become distorted. Youtube would freeze randomly and games would force close. We bought this tablet because we were buying for our kids. We thought we didn't need to spend a lot on a tablet that would just be playing a few games and watching youtube... well we were wrong. Like I said before, didn't even last a month before we started having issues and now it won't even turn on. It's a paper weight now. The 2nd tablet we bought force closes games and now for some reason ALL of the buttons are breaking. They are sinking into the tablet and they are now extremely hard to push. The power button is the worst and sometimes we can't even get the tablet to turn on because the button is almost all the way gone. We will have a 2nd paper weight very soon.<br /><br />We messaged customer service asking what we could do and they told us we could ship it back (we pay for shipping) THEN we pay a $10 fee (per tablet) for them to fix it BUT the $10 charge was only if they found the product to be defective. If they found it was &#34;damaged&#34; by us then we would have to pay more for it to be fixed or replaced. The thing that worried me is that although I asked TWICE how much it would cost us to fix it if they claimed it was damaged by us, they never answered my question. I'm not going to pay the same amount to fix is as we did to buy it. It's not worth it.<br /><br />***To customer service: If you guys want to fix my tablet and not charge me more than $10 (because these things are DEFINITELY defective), then I will change my review on the customer service aspect."
2.0,It said it's smudge proof well I put it to like this.  I'm tried of wiping the screen clean from my face or fingers prints. Buy a matte finish protector.
2.0,too slow
2.0,"Not the best choice for a college student, but the cromebook itself arrived in good condition only thing was that the Amazon box was completely torn open.... Suspicious but the laptop was in good shape."
2.0,Item stopped working within three days.
1.0,Worked for one day
5.0,"It's a memory card. It holds info. 62Gigs. Can't say more. Lower cost would be good, but it works just as it should."
4.0,"I have nothing bad to say about this product. the packaging indicated that it was new, never tampered with. it came in the mail on time and I have had no issues with the card overheating like some other reviews have mentioned. I like that fact that now I have 16GB of space and this means I can have more pictures and home movies on my phone to share. Also music for when I'm working out. Great buy and for the price I really like it. I recommend it and will be buying one more for another phone."
4.0,I like this product. I use it on an aquarium and it cools the water 5 degrees. It's silent too.
5.0,"I put this in my Asus TF700T tablet. There were mixed reports of whether the tablet would support such a large card, as the official limit for this tablet is listed as 32 GB. I have had no problems with this in the TF700T, and leave it in the device all the time. This is a great way to ensure that you have a hefty amount of media available anywhere."
3.0,"Nice back lighting, not too bright, not too dim. Also the key presses are very nice to the touch and are not loud. But after a month or so of very light use the backspace key stopped working."
4.0,Great PC for a starter.  Very satisfied with the shipping and simplicity of startup!  You may want to upgrade the graphics card to the most out of current games as the 6670 does not get you too far past med on most games.
1.0,"I ran several tests both on my computer, and my phone it wrote at 6MB and read at about 6 to 10 depeneding on its mood. I bought this to replace a generic 32GB class 10 card that I lost (so dang small i droped it and could not find it. that Card actual wrote at 11 to 12MB and read at 20MB. I went with sandisk because my phone came with a class 2 that performs more like a class 6. What a waste of time. Refunded this item"
1.0,"I purchased Sandisk because i thought it was the most reliable name brand out there. I have a Galaxy S3 and purchased this 32GB card to handle all my photo's and movies. I'd say over the last 4 months I haven't been using the storage for more than just photo's and the occasional movie. The device just failed on me yesterday, losing all my photo's and files. Thank goodness for DropBox auto-photo upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photos.I actually went back to the Amazon branded microSD card (16GB) which is about as fast and so far, way more reliable than sandisk. I can't beleive a sandisk card failed, I'm probably going to RMA the unit and hope they send me a better unit. You can guarantee that i'm going to burn in the card to make sure there's no errors.I gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product. You expect it to be as near flawless as possible."
5.0,This Micro SD card works great. I even formatted it to FAT32 to use in my car for my TV headunit and have had no issues. Plus when i bought it it was down to 34.99 from 50.00. Great deal. I recommend setting an alert on www . camel camel camel . com so you get the best price.
3.0,"The Logitech M320 is a stylish, functional mouse. The buttons and scroll wheel provide good feedback, and the invisible optical sensor tracks laminate smoothly. The sides of the mouse are not rubberized like the (less stylish) M310, but they provide adequate grip. I would have preferred if Logitech enabled configuration of this mouse through SetPoint and/or updated Logitech Options to support legacy devices since my older Logitech keyboard uses SetPoint."
4.0,"This is a great tablet for what I was lookin for-one for my 7 year old. The Free Time is worth the money-no Netflix or other service needed. I like the parent controls and my kid likes the content. The battery life is awful and there isn't a way to close out apps, but that isn't a huge issue for us as I don't allow excessive screen time anyway."
2.0,"Fits well and seems like it offers protection for the device, but the viewing angle is way too steep for typical tabletop or airplane tray table use and is very tippy.  Tried various combinations of bends in the cover to try to work around problem but none of them satisfactory. Returning item and will try something else."
4.0,All of these WD products work great right out of the box.  I do wish it had a broader base...or base option...to set it up on carpet with it falling down.
3.0,"Love the cover, but disappointed that the on/off cover is so hard to use when turning off my tablet."
1.0,Purchased to replace a 4 year old router. Great reviews swayed me into this model. Signal was mediocre at best but it worked. After about a week the router stopped working. At first thought Internet was down as it literally went from working fine to no connection. Plugged in the old net gear this was to replace and decided to keep what we had. Very disappointed.
5.0,"The Nexus One is listed as supporting a maximum of 32GB on an SDCard.Based on  reports here and elsewhere, I took out my 32GB card and put in this 64GB card and powered up the phone.The phone reported that the card was defective in a notification.I pulled down the notifications and tapped the notification that issued that report.  It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours."
4.0,"I got the 13- 13.3&#34; size. My laptop is actually only 11.6&#34; So I had a lot of wiggle room in mine. At first I thought it might have been too big, but reading the many comments on here talking about how they ordered the 15-15.6&#34; one but it didn't fit their 15.6&#34; laptop, I was kind of glad that I got the bigger sized one. Here are some of the things I like and dislike about this:<br /><br />Liked:<br />-Design: I thought the design was cute, but not &#34;girly&#34;. I like that its gender neutral.<br />-Extra Bag: I like that it came with a matching adapter bag, but unfortunately it was too small to fit my charger for the laptop, it however fit my mouse just fine.<br />-Quality: I'd say overall quality of the material, stitching, etc. is good. You do have to consider this is FELT. So for felt, this is pretty thick. Its thicker than your typical craft felt. You cannot compare it to things such as leather or vinyl.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-All Felt Fabric: Please note that this is ALL felt! When it says &#34;felt & real leather' the &#34;real leather&#34; part is just that orange strap going down the middle you see in the picture. It serves no purpose. The case itself is felt inside and out. There is no additional lining on the inside, it is that exact same grey felt you see in the picture in and out.<br />-Single Magnetic Closure: Obviously with this design you can see which end is up pretty easily but in case you pick this up upside-down by accident, the closure is not as secure as a zipper one. I don't think the one magnetic clasp is strong enough to prevent the laptop from falling out.<br />-Narrow: My laptop is about .50&#34; thick, and once I close the clasp it didn't poke up or anything but this is a very narrow &#34;pouch&#34;, and I can see thicker laptops not fitting. There is a second pocket on the inside right above the main pocket but because this pouch is so thin I can't see you being able to put anything in that pocket unless its paper.<br /><br />I don't travel too much with my laptop so this case works for me. Its just something to put my laptop in so it doesn't collect dust on my desk. If you are looking for something that really does a good job &#34;protecting&#34; then I don't think this is it. But for light use, I think its fine.<br /><br />(*I purchased this item with my own money at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion)"
1.0,"Didn't work with Windows 8.1, 10, or Vista. And I don't have the time or the inclination to find out why. Really astonishing that something as simple as a mouse could present so many problems."
4.0,"works great with my GoPro camera, and had no problem using it in my computer, all the videos are recorded just fine and in good quality"
5.0,"I bought this to increase the storage in my smartphone.The Samsung Note came with 16GB, with about 12GB usable.Installed this to store movies for long trips.Holds about 10 full length compressed mp4 movies."
5.0,I can't say anything bad about this product and it was a great price too! I would definitely recommend it.
5.0,Good
1.0,Darn thing spontaneously stopped working and all my pictures gone. I called the manufacturer and they are charging me $250 to recover my lost data. Booooo
5.0,"Works fine in my Sony RX100 using the provided adapter, but who would expect otherwise.  Bought the more expensive micro with adapter rather than full size SD so that I can move it to other devices that take micro SD.Prime shipping arrived in one day."
5.0,"Love it, it protects the screen and I love the pink"
2.0,"Did not fit my Mac, but the color was nice. Returned and was promptly refunded."
3.0,"Here's the thing. This camera is the best HD webcam out there. Better than Microsoft's even. But it has a massive issue: it is NOT supported on the Mac (OS X). Seriously Logitech? It's just absolutely ridiculous they wouldn't support Mac. It's stupid even - I mean, don't they wanna sell more cameras and make more money? -<br /><br />On a Mac, the camera will work as a generic webcam device with Skype. It also works with Wirecast. You can record with Quicktime too - but you won't get any of the setting goodness needed to get the best out of it. Download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech from the AppStore and you will get a bit more. There's an app called Webcam Settings too (3rd party - $7.99) which will give you even more control... but this all feels too hacky... not officially supported. Also, for my life, I wasn't able to make this camera be recognized by Adobe Premiere 2015 or by iMovie so it's pretty unusable for me..."
2.0,I love that the phone is big but it's alo t of things I really don't like I don't recommend this phone
1.0,Kept disconnecting from the computer every 5 seconds no matter what was plugged in. Easy way to destroy a flash drive or SD card.
4.0,It worked great!
1.0,was not a good fit
2.0,"I have bought this product since it had large number of positive feedbacks. Well, it didn't meet my expectations,  I have Lenovo Yoga 2 10 inch. well, the screen protector was just too big. I had to cut from all sides (large and small) plus it had an extra hole...<br />Maybe I got wrong one, but the package said I didn't. So this is my feedback. Since it took more than month from moment of purchase till I used it then I missed return deadline (if you are interested...) Still it does not change the facts."
1.0,Motherboard HDMI video which is integrated on the motherboard failed within 2 years.
3.0,"First of all I normally DON'T give reviews but I had to. Its an OK card, really it is for the price but two problems: it has tendency to run very hot during gaming and its super loud like all the time unless its cold in my room then it runs quiet. I've had it over a year now and I wish I had discovered the cause of the noise sooner so I could send it back for a refund, too late now but no biggie for soon I will be buying me a new GPU anyway."
4.0,Still working!
3.0,"I like it well enough, just a tad expensive. I wish there was an option to use the stick without the throttle for some games, but the 2 are inseparable."
3.0,"I normally don't don't buy items that don't have reviews, but I took a chance.  I have only had the cover for less than a day, so this rating/review is not on the durability of the cover.<br /><br />First off, I purchased two of theses cases (pink/dark blue) for an iPad mini 3, which it is advertised for (as well as the 1 and 2).  Though you can put the 3 series in this case it really is NOT I repeat is NOT  designed for the iPad mini 3.  The only reason I say that is because the home button is covered so you can not use your finger print to unlock it.  You can see this in the picture, but I thought they might have been smarter than me and turned it into a flap so you can have access.....sadly they weren't....awww!!!  I have tried even pulling back the cover but because the hard plastic circle opening is not wide enough, you the fingerprint is distorted by being stretched out as you push down over the button (that is the best way I could think to describe it).  Apple was smart enough to as allow a password (yeah  Apple!!) so you can still use this cover without accessing your print.  If it wasn't for Apple allowing a password, it would be going back, but I still dropped stars for that.<br /><br />Secondly, I have the Otter Box Defend for my phone (totally amazing) so I wanted some like that for the iPads.  The Defend series for the Otter Box has a built in screen protector which is very nice, so the 3 in 1 title threw me off thinking that maybe it had the screen protector on it.....maybe I should do more reading and less thinking....It does not.  It does have a hard plastic bottom and top part with a rubber cover with no screen protector.<br /><br />Now for the cover and estimated durability....well lets just say I received it today and online shopping for a replacement.  I am keeping it because yes it is better than nothing.....it is just okay , but<br />1) the rubber cover doesn't seem to fit as tightly as it should,<br />2) the inter plastic casing doesn't seem to be very strong, and even though it is snap together there is a movement when you push on the thin sides of the cover (which doesn't happen with the my Otter Box case on my phone.) Though most likely you would not be doing that anyway unless you pick it up by the side.<br />3)  the rubber cover to the components (ear phone jack/ charging port) though thick, it does not lay down well or tight so it can pull up easily then also can also lift the rubber covering.<br /><br />I will also  mention it DOES NOT seem to have a strong odor, but it does have some if you put your nose up to it.  I have decide to mention this because some people have reported other cases have a strong smell....this case did not bother me.<br /><br />I hope this review has help and (maybe made you smile)."
2.0,"Its screen turns dark some time for no reason. Just bought for the price, but overall do not like it."
4.0,Thank you
4.0,excellent  price. does  what  it  promises.  and  it  arrive  BEFORE  expected  delivery  date
1.0,The item did not work unfortunately.
5.0,Very fast.  Big performance improvement
1.0,"April 2013.  I have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine.  I use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small (only 128GB).  About a month ago, the card could not be recognized.  It only lasted about 2 hours, so I thought maybe just a momentary blip.  However, this weekened, it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days.  Sandisk support is not available until the week, so I will update on tech support soon.  However, I did find that the SanDisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards.  I assume they will replace it, but I have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures... so I am really bummed and frustrated.From SanDisk: ""SanDisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD cards. Under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible. The issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place. SanDisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microSD cards cards is asked to contact the SanDisk support center for a resolution immediately."" SanDisk"
3.0,Came with installation instructions. Working as expected.
2.0,"Bought this item to use with my iPad. It functions well, however every time I slightly bump or drop the stylus the tip immediately breaks off and makes the stylus non-functional. I tried to buy replacement tips and they cost $6 for a pack of three, which is almost half the price of the stylus. The reduced flexibility of the rubber on the tip causes the writing portion to break very easily. Not worth the buy in my eyes. I would return it but Amazon won't take it back."
4.0,easy to hook up
3.0,"Used for a digital camera card.Read speeds tested acceptable on a laptop using the adapter (11mb/s)WRITE speeds were atrocious reading 1mb/s to 512kb/s.The write speeds are not good for a card that needs to write files such as pictures or hd video.I have taken a few photos and tested the video, Perhaps the camera is capable of using this card at a better rated speed than the laptop and adapter"
4.0,It works well. The only problem I've seen so far is that it is a slow. It requires much longer time to copy in and out compare to a standard USB flash drive.
1.0,horrible shipping awful experience
2.0,"I've had this for about two months now and it has already broken. I keep my laptop in my purse for work and sometimes (maybe once or twice during this time frame) I place my purse down harder than I should, but it shouldn't be hard enough to break the case. The top part of the case does not stay on the laptop anymore. Extremely disappointed."
1.0,"Absolute rip off.....The case was putting so much pressure around the outside edges of the iPad.....The iPad fell off my coffee table - literally, less than 24&#34; fall......iPad screen was totally cracked.<br /><br />I would have been better off with no case.....Had no recourse.  And, after investigating, found out this was a fairly common issue  ;-("
5.0,Had it for a while no problems. Will buy it again.
2.0,"I bought this because I needed an Android device for development.  However, after unboxing, configuring, and installing some apps on this device, I really don't think I'll be using it much.  I have a year and a half old iPad mini with Retina Display, and I've already noticed several things about this device that annoy me in comparison to the iPad.  First, the display quality on this is terrible.  Aside from the low resolution, it looks like everything is grainy and over-sharpened - even the default wallpaper. Contrast on edges look artificially high.  It gets really hot while charging, using the provided wall wart.  It arrived 97% charged, but even just charging that last 3%, it was slightly uncomfortable to hold and use while charging.  The way the keyboard scales to the screen dimensions make it clunky and difficult to use.  If you plan do do a lot of typing with this device, definitely get a Bluetooth keyboard.  It also doesn't identify itself to Google properly.  I got an email from Google saying that I signed into my account with a Sony Ericsson Xperia X10.  And it was set to a Chinese time zone when I received it.  Other than that, it's slower to boot than the iPad, makes settings hard to find (I had to dig for a while to figure out how to check for updates), and the whole concept of not all apps being displayed on the homescreen / having to tap something special to view what's installed is really weird coming from iOS.  It didn't detect the settings properly for my Exchange account.  So yeah, a lot of disappointments so far, but what it has going for it is that it works, it runs Android, and it's inexpensive.  But it in no way even comes close to competing with even the least expensive previous model of Apple equipment."
1.0,It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
1.0,The item was defective. The bottom cover was too big and the shipping it back cost almost as much as the item itself. It was not worth returning. Won't buy from here again.
4.0,"Got this yesterday, the 64GB item. Installed it in my new Samsung Tab3 and turned it on. the Tab3 saw it right away, and I decided to format it,,, only took a couple of seconds and I was good to go. It shows that I have 59,000 memory units available, they must use the rest for overhead I guess. I haven't used it yet, but I am sure it will work fine. If I have any problems I will note here,,, also if I have great praise for it I will note that also. At $34.99 I guess it was a good price as I see it is now $46.00, maybe I shoulda ordered two of them. This is my first time for a lap top, and I will be on a big learning curve. I got the lap top at Costco last week,,,,,,,, I sure hope a old dog can learn new tricks....."
4.0,Good quality. Bright color. Moderate protection.
3.0,"So far it has worked, HOWEVER when we got the tablet it still had ALL the previous owners information on it! Apps, pictures, and personal videos!!! Videos and pictures of their children! One would think that these would have been erased. Makes me not want to send any electronics back. How they refurbished this but left everything on it including their names is beside me!"
1.0,Loved it at first. Great sound. Three months later and it has a constant buzzing in the right ear speakers. Which is one month longer than the return policy.
3.0,DIED IN A MONTH
2.0,The battery did not help. My laptop &#34;fried&#34; and was still heating up.
3.0,"Beautiful case. Very disappointed that the auto sleep/wake function did not work. We are used to using the auto sleep/wake feature on our iPads, so it was a no brainer that this was a feature we were looking for in a new case. I am reluctant to return it because we really like the cover, but we have to have this feature.  Maybe we just ended up with one that was not made properly for it to line up with the iPad. At any rate, we have to keep searching and return this."
4.0,These are great little cards and are very fast. The only thing I hate about microSD is that they are so dang small and the slots are spring loaded. I have lost a couple from them shooting across the room.
4.0,Excellent computer for moderate upgrade. Arrived as listed.
1.0,"Stopped working in less than 2 years, still on warranty which covers only the hardware, so all my data lost and nobody is responsible :( I didn't expect it to die that soon so no proper backup was done. Data recovery fee is $600 and above, I just gave up and bought Sinology station with RAID, hope this will hold up better."
2.0,"The tablet arrived with no charger or manual. However, the description says &#34;The product ships with all relevant accessories&#34;.  I bought this for a friend who is very dissatisfied that at least the charger was not included."
2.0,"While I like the feel and &quot;performance&quot; of the mouse, I cant use it because it makes a horrible high pitched squeal when I'm using it.<br />When I narrowed it down to the mouse making the noise, I looked at the reviews here on Amazon and sure enough, other people were<br />having the same exact problem.<br />How is it that Logitech hasn't addressed this problem?"
3.0,This cover does not provide a secure stand for the G4.  As you work with the tablet the stand will give way.  It does protect the tablet when being carried.
3.0,nice to have but it hangs which eventually wears on the cord.
2.0,"I got two of these for me and my wife. We both have macbook pro 13 mid 2012. In both cases, we can see a wrinkle on spacebar near the kuzy name. It is extremely annoying that when I move fingers on the keyboard, that wrinkle pulls the whole cover up just a little."
5.0,Love it!
1.0,"When I decided to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle to the Voyage, I opted to get the screen protector too. I have a screen protector on the original Kindle (which was much less expensive than this one) and it has a non glossy finish, so I assumed the one for the Voyage would be the same. (I should have remembered that old saying about assumption!) I like to read outside and this protector makes that nearly impossible. I feel as if I've thrown $30 right into the garbage.....which I suppose, in a way I have, since that's where I intend to put this product!"
2.0,"Still learning about it. But wanted to be able to replace my old Kindle reader but can't get the font large enough to be easy on my old eyes. The streaming of video seems very good, but I don't stream a lot of video. Nice to be able to check email. Tried to use to steam TV on Southwest flight but browser was not compatible. Ordered a cover using the Fire HD but the order did not go through. This device is less useful than I expected, would like to return it."
4.0,Great case; fast shipping; front pocket zipper broke easily
2.0,"bought this motherboard recently and it would not run the bios. after taking it to a computer repair shop they said the motherboard was faulty and that i'd need to get it replaced. I've read good reviews on this motherboard as well as a handful of bad ones claiming the same problem i'm having. i'm still optimistic that this is a quality type of motherboard, hopefully the replacement wont have the same problem."
2.0,"It's okay for the price. However I think it could be better. The mic picks up all extra noise. If the ear covers were on a swivel, it would be much more comfortable. I advise finding something better."
3.0,Doesn't charge very well. Takes hours to charge my Ipad mini and my iphone 5.
5.0,It's mini storage.  It doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to.  I purchased it to add additional storage to my Microsoft Surface Pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 GB.  It does what it's supposed to and SanDisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.
3.0,Appears much smaller than 7&#34;
2.0,I am now awaiting a replacement from Sandisk because it failed after the Amazon return period.  Always had good luck with Sandisk cards until now.  Phone and PC simply stopped seeing the card.  Lost all of my data (which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere).
5.0,I remember when I built computers that had 5' x 3' 2GB hard drives; and by now most have Googled to learn of the room sized computers with basketball sized transistors.Micro computer; how long before our entire life will fit on something smaller than the point of a needle . . .?This SDXC disk has worked well with my Nokia Lumia Windows 8 phone. My wife has one in her Android phone and with kids taking pictures and making movies 64GB is starting to look like to little an amount of storage.
3.0,so the fan works fine it does what its supposed to do but let me say that the red led is not good at all . imusing a corsair spec 01 red case so i got the 1 fan that was included with the case and its way better than this fan. the fan also gives off a very weird buzzing noise that gets slightly louder when the case cover gets put back on because the sound doesnt have much room to escape. so if u wear a headset you should be fine but i dont like wearing one and unfortunately corsair doesnt sell the same fans that came with the case.
4.0,"Good length, but not very pliable."
2.0,"Bad design. The power port is not thought out and brakes off from the mother board just after 2 weeks of use. Acer support wants you to ship it in for 6 weeks turn around. No loaner laptop offered. Amazon is great, we returned this defective thing and purchased a Yoga 3."
3.0,It is not oleophobic so the touches have some drag.
2.0,"Feels crappy, very cheap. Would not fit into the recessed round outlets in Europe making it useless"
2.0,Perfect fit but dies extremely fast. Last for about a hr total. Get what u pay for.
5.0,"This flash drive is perfect!  I purchased this for my job...I'm an assistant and I take notes and minutes during board meetings. It records board meetings clearly and it's so helpful to have the file stored on the flash drive so all I have to do is plug it in and open the file when I need to type my minutes. Every time the recorder is turned off it saves that file separately, which is handy when you have multiple meetings a week. The microphone is pretty good as well, it captures the loudest talker as well as the softest talker of the group. This was a great buy!"
3.0,"it has worked for my purpose, it lasted about around a year."
2.0,Case looks good but already is starting to crack and chip. It's been 2 weeks
4.0,"Great product for the price - does the job very well. My only complaint is the non-intuitive menu navigation, which could use some fixing. Otherwise, very nice."
5.0,The price for this 64GB micro SD card is excellent compare to retail. The card is reliable with no issues at all. I bought one for my Samsung Note 8 tablet and Samsung Galaxy S4!
2.0,Cute style/color but not durable at all. Didn't last long.
5.0,"I needed this for my phone. I listen to a lot of music and 32 GB's is not enough. It took me a while to get it to work since my phone is older and not capable of working with Ex-Fat, but once I got that straightened out, it's worked great."
3.0,"Bought this for Samsung Galaxy S3 in Fall 2012 and that card works perfectly to this day.  Bought the same card in May 2013 for Galaxy S4 and it continuously mounts and unmounts.  Sometimes it is not even recognized by S4 or PC.  Amazon is awesome and pre-shipped a replacement.  It did the same thing, though.  According to Cnet, Sandisk acknowledged a &#34;manufacturing problem&#34; with these cards back in January 2013.  Said it was fixed, but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses.  Returned both and ordered Samsung's 64gb micro sdxc card.  $12 more and slightly slower read/write specs, but works perfectly in S4 and I can't tell the difference in its speeds compared to the Sandisk that works in my S3."
3.0,"For the first couple of days I couldn't access Windows 10,  I was ready to return the laptop, but I sought help from  an expert who after a few hours of work,the Windows 10  icon finally appeared, I was able to keep the machine which works well so far."
4.0,"Only issue is the blue is darker than what's pictured.  Otherwise, it's a great product."
1.0,You know when you turn off a device it should save the battery life... Well not this each time i do the battery is dead.. What am i to do now it wont charge
1.0,"While using this device to house my external ssd, it keep disconnecting itself from my Mac without warning. This is not good for many reasons, all of my music is on here and when I do a gig I can't have this happen at a live event."
3.0,"I was really excited for this but i am quite disappointed. The sound quality is ok, not the best, i would prefer my iphone earphones than these!! It looks stylist but not as comfortable like what other people said, even though i have very small ears! Overall, its ok so so, bit the price is good"
1.0,Sticker is starting to come off ain't even had it that long. That's my falt for buying cheap
3.0,"I ordered this item in particular because it has a suction cup underneath the tray. It works alright in terms of keeping the soap dry in between uses, but the dish was wobbly on the counter. air doesn't come off, but it doesn't sit on the counter tight. I ordered two trays and bother are the same way.<br /><br />One of the dishes did not come with the suction cup originally, but was replaced right away!"
3.0,"Okay, I paired this up with my [[ASIN:B00JXLGE70 Dell XPS XPSU12-8000CRBFB 12.5-Inch 2 in 1 Convertible Laptop]] and yes it did work... if the objective is to simply extend the battery time with an extra charge.  With that said however, starting with a battery that was down to 17% when I connected the Power Companion, it only charged the laptop back to 74% after leaving things undisturbed for 5 hours.<br /><br />The directions could be a tad more explicit, it took a few minutes to figure things out, but once I realized which cord to use, things went smoother.  Also, be aware that you will need the original charger unit to plug this into."
1.0,"I bought this card for my android based phone, soon I started getting messages that my card had been removed and or it was damaged, Tried it in my tablet same thing, and this was not the first card of this brand that I had bought that experienced this problem. Went to several online forums to see what the solution is; then someone hit upon it, it just might be a problem with this brand of cards.I bought a PNY brand micro SD card and had no problem whatsoever."
4.0,"Worked as advertised. Connection is fast, even on a power strip. The included software is not Win10 compatible and it's required to reset the adapters to factory default. Download the latest version from the website, which works on Win10."
2.0,"Worked good for a year, then crashed"
1.0,Died after 2 days. What else can you say.
1.0,Buttons are trashy.
3.0,Great product but sent me wrong color
1.0,I want it fixed
1.0,"I too received a counterfeit card. Once you get to about 1/2 capacity the card becomes unusable, it is trash. I buy from Amazon because I trust Amazon and try to buy only well recognized name brands. Sandisk has a serious problem it appears.<br /><br />Worse, when I contacted their (Sandisk) customer service they directed me to download SD card formatting programs from HP and some freeware stuff. Come on Sandisk, you make these SD cards and don't have a program that you can provide to your customers to fix problems or identify if the card isn't genuine?<br /><br />Also, shame on Amazon for allowing these counterfeit cards to get into their inventory. There is obviously a problem somewhere and I would easily suspect someone is swapping out counterfeit cards for genuine cards and making a lot of money doing it. In other words, an inside job?"
2.0,"Daughter received this as a birthday gift. As far a tablet...it does what you would expect it to. It's a good size for our daughter. But immediately upon using we began having issues with getting it to charge. Yes, we are using the charger that came with it. It only charges sometimes; and when it does it constantly cycles through some power on/power off thing. Sometimes it will take 12 hours to get it to a full charge again. Very, very disappointed in this tablet."
3.0,"Good method of application, but still left a number of bubbles no matter what I tried.  Can't see them when unit is on.  Has a tendency to retain marks from finger swipes and need to wipe off regularly."
3.0,"kind of dissappointed, had an ipad before, will buy another ipad next time"
3.0,"Why reviews are bad is probably because everyone seemed to get their jot touch last year when adonit was still fixing problems with the iPad air 2. It works pretty good with it now if you have the latest model. Got my bluetooth to hook up pretty quick, I use Procreate and Adobe Sketch on my air 2. Pen pressure is okay, not the greatest but still workable. Overall it's a good stylus and I'm happy I got mine. I gave it four stars because it's not perfect. I don't believe there's a perfect stylus out for iPad air 2 yet, but as I said this is a good stylus to have if you want to draw now. Other reasons why it's four stars instead of five... When I draw on my iPad the lines cut short sometimes and the pen won't work right away after I tap the screen a few times. Maybe because I didn't set my pen to different writing styles... Be sure to set your pen to a writing style you prefer, it's always good to just play around with that. Also, when drawing, the pen won't come into contact with the screen if it's near the edge of the iPad. I guess Adonit is still working with other minor issues with that, be sure to check their blog for updates.  Edit: returning it because I don't think this is the latest one Edit 2: It's not the latest one, get it on their website instead. I was surprised that this version worked OK on the iPad Air 2 tho."
1.0,"the quality was just too poor to describe. bought one from fry's on sale for about $11.00 with mail-in rebate for promotion. used about 1 month or so, it just stopped working. poor materials, weak structure, loud fan noise....etc., etc. don't buy it even it offers for free. just one more junk for recycle bin."
5.0,"Works good with Nokia Lumia 822. Has plenty of space for music, pictures and especially for movies at high resolution."
3.0,The card was good.  Haven't had a problem with it yet.  Good price.  Fit the product I bought it for.
3.0,"Need updated wiring harness, I had to use adapters"
4.0,"Good quality product for the price, I bought it for my go pro and I haven't had any issues yet."
3.0,"Pros:<br />Good length<br />Good braiding<br />Interesting colors<br />Seems well constructed<br />Cons:<br />As others have said, the micro usb portion is too long so it sticks out. This does not hamper the operation but in my opinion it could cause them to brake more easily.<br />They seem to work better in via a USB 3.0 port vs 2.0 at least with my Xbox One controller, which is odd as I think they should work the same in either port.<br />Need even more color choices<br />Summary:<br />Would probably buy again if needed.  But if someone sold the same items and fixed my list of Cons then I would purchase those."
5.0,Moved my music library for phone/car use.Easy to set up and reliable.The drivers didn't like my older laptop so I had to work around it - any teen can tell you how to do so with only a slight roll of the eyes.
5.0,Very good
5.0,"Bought this for a surveillance camera, but ended up using in my nook HD+....Works fine! I've bought a few of these over time through Amazon, have never had a problem with them."
2.0,"While this laptop pad does move air and keeps the laptop cool, the design flaws are a real let down. I have a 17&#34; laptop and ordered the 17&#34; fan however my laptop hangs over the edge of each side by about an inch so it's not wide enough. The top surface is slippery and the laptop consistently slides down the front of the fan to the desk making it difficult to work. I have to push the laptop back over the edge so the rubber feet on my machine catch the back lip of the fan housing to hang it up from falling forward. The blue lights are always on. So annoying and really is this a necessary feature for a fan? Who needs to have blue glow from under their laptop?!! The final and most annoying flaw is the usb cord at both ends the wiring has come loose and bent so now I find myself not wanting to replace the wire but to purchase a whole new fan. The long and the short, the fan works great and keeps the laptop cool but the design and quality of product fail. I really wanted to like this product."
3.0,Its an alright cable for the money. the cable has a little bit of ghosting but I am still happy with it.
3.0,Not as fast as I expect4ed for boot up.
5.0,"I usually buy Sandisk cards, the quality, performance, and reliability are worth the couple extra dollars.  I have had them survive the washer and dryer a few times."
5.0,I ordered this to replace an aging Class 4 card being used with N2A (Nook 2 Android) KitKat 4.4.  This card turned that into a usable Android tablet!  N2A with the Class 4 card was brutally slow but now the tablet is very useful.  Definitely worth the upgrade.
5.0,"Get a fast card for your gadgets, this is a class 10.  Higher the number the faster the read/write it is and sandisk is a well know reputable name.  I would avoid the cheap junk as if it fails then you've lost what's on the card most likely!"
5.0,Product supplied as described: 16GB Micro SDHC Class 10 card with Adapter. I purchased this to use in my Samsung Galaxy Tablet and it works perfectly. It is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red/grey color. This is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device!
1.0,"This armband is AWFUL and grossly insufficient. I purchased May 2015 and halfway through August 2015 the velcro hooks do not &#34;stick&#34; anymore. Upon closer inspection I realized that some of the hooks have just ripped off from me taking the armband off after working out. If you need something cheap for a weekend hiking trip or plan to keep it on your arm without removing it this product is PERFECT. Else, I strongly suggest spending a little more for better quality...my lesson fully learned!"
1.0,"the item above lasted only about 20 copys or duplications before the reader drive failed.so I read the writing on the wall, and sent it back.won't reorder till the industry gets it together.See all makers of duplicators share the same components.So i'll do without.Thanks."
3.0,"I love the concept of the Logitech Headset. It is seriously lacking in execution in one critical area. The wire that plugs into the computer or phone is very delicate. Extremely fragile. Even with careful handling expect it to last 2 months at best. At this price however, it's worth it. Sound quality is excellent and the microphone works great. If you do not like earbuds this is a decent alternative. Remember to handle the plugin wire gingerly."
4.0,"Works as advertised, now sharing Cable TV and Internet in same room, with 2 older non wifi enabled computers"
2.0,Bad product never worked really well. Wish I could still return it
4.0,For the size of sound bar does a good job.  Better then the TV speakers.
1.0,"This started off as a great purchase, until it wasn't. Before this router we had an old linksys which, while it worked well, did not provide us with the speed and range that we wanted. One day while perusing amazon for alternatives I stumbled onto this one. Oh how happy I was to have something that offered the ability to stream Netflix without issue and allowed my son to use the Xbox without lag. After setting it up with a unique username and password and connecting our myriad devices to our new wifi we were off... That is until the day I tried to log into my wifi settings and happened upon someone else's router settings. Imagine my surprise when I logged into the settings to find none of my own devices, no gaming systems, smart phone or laptops, but rather those belonging to someone else. I touched nothing in the way of settings and logged out and once again tried to log into my settings. Nothing. No interface, not even a login window. I tried to reset the router to factory settings and after it power cycled it was if nothing had happened, all the settings that should have been wiped out were still there. My phone connected, along with the rest of the wifi devices that litter my house, yet I still couldn't log into my router settings.<br /><br />It was at that point that I called the Asus component help line. I phone number that, while offering that ability to speak with someone, offered little in the way of any help. After an hour on the phone with some man who spent more time yelling and interrupting me then offering assistance, I hung up vowing never again to call that number. That was months ago... and while I have been monitoring my network to ensure that no one was making unauthorized use of my internet with a 3rd party program, it was bothersome that I could not access my network settings.<br /><br />My plan to never again contact the Asus help line was working well, up to today when I realized that I needed to connect a new network camera to our home network, and hoping that last time was a fluke I decided to chance another call. This time around the experience was better...to begin with. The helpful gentleman was quick to assess my problem, a non-functioning reset button. He assured me that everything would be taken care of and that I would be receiving a new router shortly, stating that he only needed to place me on a brief hold to finish processing the RMA.<br /><br />After a few short minutes Lee, that was his name, joined my back on the phone saying that unfortunately to process the RMA I would first need to ship my current router back, and that it would take anywhere from a week or two to receive my new, hopefully functional router. It seems ridiculous that in a world in which the internet is now required for school (both my wife and sons respective schools require them to have internet access to turn in homework assignments and papers) and work that the removing ones ability to access the internet is something that a company deems acceptable. I voiced my concern to Lee, who to his credit did his best to see that my concerns were mollified, and he transferred me to someone claiming to be a specialist. When I explained to her that it is impossible for my household to make due without access to school websites since my wife's college classes make use of online exams and my son's school requires homework to be done on an iPad and submitted electronically (an issue for another time) she told me that while there has been an outcry for an advanced refunding process for routers, Asus would be unable to assist me in my request, I was flabbergasted. It seems absurd to me that a company, any company, would be deaf to the request of there clientele, and more so when that company is located in the tech sector with global reach (what would they do without internet for a week? I realize that the comparison is one of a hyperbolic nature, but the point remains in a world were many make their living in a home office a week or two without access to the internet could have a devastating effect on there income). I was informed that while their motherboard department was afforded the luxury of sending working replacements before receiving the defective product, that an arbitrary line in the sand had been drawn and on this side there was nothing to be done.<br /><br />I was appalled. After having spend a small fortune on various Asus products over the past five to ten years on products that range from monitors to motherboards I was offered little more then a cold shoulder. I have had various other problems with other hardware purchased for computers; some faulty hard drives, ram and motherboards from other companies, and in every other situation the RMA has been handled after working replacements have arrived at my door step. The customer service I was provided was anything but customer orientated. Since I now need a new router, it looks like I will be looking at Asus's competitors for both my immediate and future hardware needs.et could have a devastating effect on there income).

1.0,"I bought the SanDisk 32 Gb micro SD card (class 10) in Dec for a new Galaxy S3. I used it for songs and video and pics. It started acting flaky in April and would unmount itself and then remount and I had problems with playing music. Then it completely died and would not even reformat. This is a known issue, and I will write back after I try to get SanDisk to replace it."
2.0,Product is alright but it does not support 1920x1080 u have to directly connect it to the monitor save the settings then switch it back to the switcher and it is very flimsy
2.0,"The bluetooth keyboard itself is fantastic. Very responsive and ridiculous battery life. The case itself is junk. Putting my Galaxy Tab 4 in the very first time and I heard some snaps and crackles. I came to find the thin plastic cutout for the power button had cracked. After light use with opening and closing the case, some more cracks at the hinge. Now I'm gunshy about opening the case for fear of the hinge completely breaking and my tablet falling to the ground."
5.0,This card is extremely fast. In order to leverage its full capability your card reader and device must support UHS-I. However it is also very fast with class 10 devices.
1.0,This time is no good at all . My is already bloke
3.0,"Does what it is supposed to, but one of the wires keeps falling out so one of my fans will only light up but it won't run."
2.0,Used it once and the plastic holder for the iPad broke. Won't buy again.  I'll try something else.
4.0,"Works fine my Virgin Mobile HTC EVO V. The phone didn't recognize it at first, but after formatting it's all good."
3.0,"Just not very good on OS X. I have always noticed the same issues with Logitech and OS X which is jumpy/jittery motion. Maybe I am too picky, but as much as I dislike the ergonomics of the Magic Mouse, it shows the fluid motion that all mice should have. For a $100 mouse I really wanted to like this, but I do a fair amount of photo touch ups, and this Logitech mouse just does not cut it.<br /><br />Yes, I updated everything blah blah blah lol<br /><br />I will be returning to the store I bought it at tomorrow."
4.0,I bought one for my GoPro last year and ended up putting it in my tablet last week. Ordered another one for the GoPro. After the trip next week it will go in my phone. Guess I'll need another one for the next trip.
5.0,"It was more than expected , fits nice and all controls work well with it on."
5.0,"good, would recommend"
3.0,"Very nice keyboard, the incline for this is actually a lot more extreme than other keyboards, but my friend that I bought this for likes this feature. The overall feel of this keyboard is good, easy to type on with no weird key placements.<br /><br />Only thing I think that could be improved here is the lights need to be MUCH brighter. They are practically non existent under normal room lighting. There is no brightness level change.  This is one of the main selling points of the keyboard and is very underwhelming."
2.0,Didn't stick very well and cracked real easy.
2.0,"I returned this item, it was too small"
4.0,Cable works as advertised
3.0,Great video card for what I needed (multiple DisplayPort connectors) but PNY has their head up their you know what.  This card ONLY ships with a 1/2 height back panel bracket and PNY refuses to provide any options for full height even though bracket is identical to the NVS510 (that ships with both)!  I ended up cutting up the 1/2 bracket included with the card and a plan full ht bracket and bolting them together (franken bracket).  It works great but looks like crap.  I deducted two stars because of this idiocy.
3.0,We purchased it for our twin 9 year old daughters. It suits their needs for using the internet and was an inexpensive way for them to have their own computer. They are able to play all the online programs required for school and it frees our household computer for us. The only thing that was annoying is that the charger never worked and we had to purchase a new one.
2.0,"I find the case to be of poor construction quality and it's very difficult to get SD cards out of the pockets once inserted. I'll still keep this because it's not worth sending back for a refund, but I won't be purchasing another one like it again."
3.0,"It's a little slow but decent for the money that I paid for it, still relatively new so hopefully it continues to run decently for the rest of the time I'm in college"
5.0,Using it with action cameras and they work just fine with no issues.  Tend to be getting around 2hrs when filming at 1080p @30fps for the 16gb card
2.0,"Barely fits my iPad one w/o a case on it, have to literally squeeze it in."
4.0,"Something this small with so much information stored on it freaks me out. But I've had zero problems with it over the past year. The only issue I had is that the adapter that came with it did not work. The microsd card went into it kind of sidways like it was made wrong. Luckily I had another adapter lying around, and the sd card itself works perfectly and I've had no issues with data loss or corruption."
3.0,It is a bit too bulky!
3.0,I canceled this item before planed this order.
5.0,"This is one of the better reviewed SDHC Class 10 cards that utilized UHS. By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have... BUY IT"
5.0,This was a great fast card and I had no issues with it. My GS3 recognized it quickly and still works a year later.
3.0,Looks like the original and works fine too. No complaints.
5.0,"I don't have too much to say about an SD card, but I wanted to at least give it the 5 stars it deserves. We used it in a Galaxy S3 and it has worked flawlessly so far. I haven't  run any benchmarks to confirm the speed, etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera (which we now have saving photos/videos to the SD card) in any way.I will point out the The S3 camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone's internal memory. Potentially due to the high date of data being written. That's good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an SD card for that purpose."
2.0,"The picture posted is not what you receive. What you receive is a charger identical to a standard apple charger. This product worked great for a day. I have since plugged it in to the extension cable from my previous apple charger and within 3 or 4 hours it began to emit a high frequency sound. I touched the cord and felt electricity running through my hand. Nothing harmful, but definitely not safe. I will wait a few days, but will most likely return this product."
2.0,I've had 3 of these in the four years I've had my MB pro.
5.0,Works great in my GoPro 3 Black. I will only buy SanDisk. If you want a name you can trust this is it.
5.0,My daughter loves this case and it seems to do a great job protecting her laptop.
5.0,Purchased for my cell phone. No problems or complaints. This is my second purchase and so far so good. I have several SanDisk products and have yet to complain.
4.0,its memory.<br />they worked out of the package.<br />they had the requisite space available.
2.0,This does not seem to be as fast as they advertise.  Its slower than a old 64gb card I had. It is supposed to be the new 128gb faster version.<br />On the front of the envelope it says microSDXC UHS-I up to 80MB/s I get up to 20MB/s using PC and Android<br />On the back off the envelope it says SDSQUNC-128G-GN6M<br />SD Insite says its a SL128 rev8.0 Manufactured Aug 2015. SD Physical Layer 3.0 SDXC Card Security version 3.xx<br /><br />Using my PC I only seen up to 20mb reads and 9 to 12 writes.<br /><br />Using A1 SD Bench memory card test I see 20mb reads and 9.66 writes on the long test.<br />Don't wast your money on this card. IT seems a legit Sandisk card but not even close to the advertised speed.
1.0,"Multiple keys stopped working after a few days. Not worth the money, I suggest you take your business eleswhere."
2.0,This thing is really slow. Tried to take advantage of the number of features but system couldn't handle it. Now I just use it for backups and minor file storage/sharing.
5.0,Got this to shoot in HD. It is working really well so far. It is handling HD recording and playback great.
3.0,My only complaint is that the cord easily disconnects from the headset!. Great sound quality.
2.0,"way too small for an adult's hand and i have a small hand. Even for a wireless mouse, this is too small"
1.0,These tablets are great except if one of defective twice they don't warranty or refund BE VERY CAREFUL BUYING Anyone that has had problems with tabletexpress please visit and like my page. Facebook.com/tabletexpressstinks  We can get enough people to file a lawsuit and get back all the  time and money we have spent dealing with a company that screws over loyal customers. I recommended 5 people to buy them 4 out of 5 were defective. NOT Counting they'd two out of three that have failed in my household alone.
4.0,"I like this tablet so far.  I bought this for my 2 little boys to use in the car to watch youtube/netflix movies on/off line.  I happen to have an extra phone line with Tmobile with 10gb data per month so I may as welll use it.  It is of course no iPad quality, screen not as bright, so so resolution, and a little slower than I am used to with other high priced device, but it serves what i need right now.  I installed sim card and it connected with the right APN settings for 4G LTE automatically (I called Tmobile to make sure that is right setting for their fastest speed).  I am sure the kids will love this new age &#34;car entertainment system&#34;.  I can load a bunch of movies onto micro sd card and they are set for long road trip."
3.0,"works as well as a SD card can i guess, but its not 64gb its (59.45GB) not like it really is all that big a deal but i just found it strange."
2.0,"Slower than my crucial drive of matching specs and failed within 3 months. I'll make sure to update this review one day when the replacement drive finally arrives. Though before failing it did cause random system crashes, hopefully the replacement will function better and for longer, but the minute I popped in my system clone on the crucial drive the crashes stopped and its been a perfect system again going on 2 months."
2.0,"I'm not one to write a bad review but s*** man, these didn't last month. Very disappointed, won't be buying from u again."
2.0,Product came with a broken corner. I kept it because it does not affect it too much and I really needed a case for my computer and did not have the time or an alternative.
3.0,"I purchased this product on February 6. Looking at reviews, I am one of the lucky ones, I guess, seeing as it lasted nearly 6 months. However, the logo didn't strike me as a knockoff, but I am no expert. Your money will apparently go further with an Apple purchase. I am unable to comment on the return policy at this time, but if something is amiss there, I will update the comment."
3.0,Benchmarks kind of disappointing. I was expecting a little more considering its specs. But its ok
4.0,"Bought it while it was one sale for $35.... I love itIt has given my Surface some wiggle room.Don't expect the read and write speed to be super fast. Most likely you computer doesn't support the current protocol to transfer at the Max speed.Overall Quality you expect from SanDisk though I think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microSD expansion aside from Samsung"
2.0,Corrupted the Mac on boot. Not the right accessory
5.0,"Can there be anything wrong with a sandisk product?  the items read to it sooooo quickly, I am quite happy,"
3.0,This fit somewhat small just like the pants but it's super cute and the material is high quality
2.0,I didn't realize this was frosted and it has a noticeable &#34;K&#34; logo on the bottom right of the case that is unattractive.
2.0,"As delivered June 2015, this router has some quality problems.  I connected it to a wireless broadband antenna and had expected connectivity for 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks, the connection between the router and the tower (through the WISP provided antenna) kept dropping.  It took about a month of troubleshooting with the WISP and Netgear.  Three phone calls later with Netgear revealed that the router construction is prone to dropping connections.  Netgear sent a different unit (model WNDR 4300) as a replacement, forcing me to re-set the entire home network and to re-sync it with the WISP.  I'll probably buy a different brand next time; the good reviews on this one weren't worth much to me this time.  Zero stars for quality on the first unit, 2 stars for Netgear making good on replacing defect"
4.0,"Works great in my modern phone and tablet. However I was unable to use it on my PC's SD card reader. It appears the older card readers are not compatible with Class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (Win7) reporting write errors.I probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card."
2.0,This comes curled up in shipping and I couldn't get the curl to release and lay flat. Some have tried boiling it in water but I think that's a bit over the top. I was never able to use it.
3.0,"Isn't as bright as the picture looks.  Kinda disappointed, but the airflow is great!"
4.0,Works well. Charges faster than the OE one. Not crazy about the offset plug or 90 degree plug on the other end. Both of those features can cause it to be a bit awkward to use. But otherwise it's fine.
1.0,did not work at all.
3.0,Certainly didn't blow me away.  The software is lacking in many areas and the built-in microphone is disappointing.  If I bought it again I'd by the cheaper version with just the sound card.
4.0,This saves me from paying rental to Comcast. It will pay for itself in less than a year. It was easy to set up - pretty much plug and play - with every penny.
5.0,"I bought this for a Sansa Clip+, it worked after formatting the card to FAT32.  Can't say much other than I have tons of lossless songs here that were previously on CDs.  What I don't like in general is that manufacturers LIE about real size of cards arguing some technical issue, it's like saying that 2+2=5, when in reality is not, this card like any other card is not 64gb, it's more like 62gb (can't remember exact size, don't have card available at hand).2+2 is not =5.  This card is advertised as 64gb yet in reality is lower, manufactures using false advertising as usual. This kinds of memory cards are a good example of false advertisement."
2.0,stopped working after only a few months
1.0,You get what you pay for. In this case I got 18 months of progressively poorer performance until the tablet completely failed. It no longer turns on even with the factory reset procedure and with the tablet plugged in.  I'll never purchase another ASUS product.
3.0,"A bit expensive for 3 screws, but i needed them"
1.0,Did not work straight out of the box!!!!
3.0,"Battery works great. Size very slightly different. Seems to fit fine but cannot slide the lock lever into place. Old batt locks fine and could not spot any difference, but this batt will not lock. This is the only reason for this 3 star rating."
3.0,perfect fit!
3.0,"I was able to get a black and white image after downloading the updated drivers. I was unable to get sound from the device.<br /><br />After fiddling with countless possible combinations among the settings I gave up trying to make it work. This device is apparently only PAL friendly, which means that if you're in the Americas or Japan, you're gonna have a bad time getting this to work properly.<br /><br />The image received from the device was however impressively decent considering the price of the capture card and the overall quality of other aspects of the product. If you're in a PAL region, this is definitely a product worth getting if you want good quality images and don't want to spend too much.<br /><br />Here's what the image looks like (obviously in black and white): https://youtu.be/MeE1mHPoQCY<br /><br />And I'll attach a screencap from that video (reflecting admittedly poorer quality, so you might as well watch the video) to this review."
5.0,"the product works after several months. i have no problems with it, and its holding out well! thank you very much"
4.0,My granddaughter wanted this for her phone so she could put songs on it.  She loved the card and its capacity.
3.0,Haven't been able to use it as I need to. Nothing is showing up on the projector. I can't quite figure out whether the problem is this device or my computer or the projector.
2.0,Bad product
1.0,"Broke not even a year later, wouldn't buy from this seller again. Just purchase right from Apple"
2.0,"BD stopped working after a short bit of usage (DVDs seems to work though).  I bought a different brand and everything works fine so it's not the computer, software,disk or cabling.  Maybe it was a dud but I had to buy a different brand and that one seems to be working better, longer for me."
1.0,"Its been 2 months of use and the left hinge just broke, it didnt fell or took any abuse in any way, one day it started making a noise, next plastic pieces jus fell off the hinge when i opened the screen. Poor quality laptop. Dont buy this piece of crap, the right hinge is now broken, and because im far from usa i cant return it"
2.0,"very heavy duty cord. unfortunately in short order (6 uses)  it stopped working.  It charges intermittently but only if I squeeze the right area of the wire.<br />I had a 10 foot cord, much &#34;lighter duty&#34;  that lasted me years this one not so much"
3.0,I wish that the keyboard cover was the same color as the laptop cover.
3.0,"Has a very large housing for the small end. This means that it doesn't fit into my phone with the case on it, which is pretty annoying for a phone charger."
5.0,"I wanted a 64GB card for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I've learned my lesson about buying from that well-known auction site we all know, and getting fake cards there.  I've always had good experiences buying memory cards from Amazon, and always got genuine stuff.  This card was recognized by my phone right away, mounted, and formatted perfectly.  I have a ton of music on it, and some videos, and still have about 12 GB free.  I feel like I got my money's worth!"
2.0,If you have a square tablet that just fits beware that the corners of the case are sounded.Ii could not zip it shut.  Will have to size up.
3.0,Very difficult to get used to. Ended up getting a click key version.
2.0,"Disappointed, quit working after a short period of time. Started out with good sound quality but then just quit. Glad I had the insurance<br />I was refunded my purchase price."
4.0,"Works as intended, but cheaply made. The threads aren't super clean, and the plating seems cheap, but I haven't had any issues over the last 4 weeks."
2.0,The Pi is great but the screws provided with the case were too small.  Had to bust out my own screw collection to mount the Pi into the case.
5.0,"I bought this SD card for use with my cell phone. It worked really well and as far as I could tell, transfers the data at a fast rate. No complaints."
2.0,I think my memory card came with some pictures and videos already on it??!?? Looks like some guy playing around with his camera in a hotel room? CREEPY!
2.0,Well it's keeping my computer on BUT not charging my laptop and yes it'a the correct one for my laptop.
1.0,not a burner
2.0,"I could not get the mouse to work on several computers. The packaging indicated it was from 2011, so this is an older product. I have computers with the right Windows Logo and it didn't work on them. HP's support number was not familiar with the product and basically said they couldn't help unless I tried it with an HP computer! Too bad as I would like a wireless mouse with no dongle for my non-Bluetooth computers. Update: I found an HP 6530b laptop that just happened to need a clean install of Windows 7 and I installed this mouse first thing, even before Windows Updates. It works fine on this computer most of the time, however is slow to connect during startup as it's dependent on the Wi-Fi loading and connecting during boot."
4.0,I bought this tablet for use with a downloaded ISailor navigation app that serves as a backup to my chart plotter on my boat. It was an economical approach which also provides opportunity for other boating & weather apps.  It serves the purpose well.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:dd0611549646c51189ce37055bd7d809]]I am so very impressed with the fans elegant and concise design it has beautiful colors as well.  The good thing is that this fan is USB powered and comes with a usb cord.  It also can be battery operated as well. It is quiet sleek light weight and easy to carry.  I did receive this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my personal unbiased review.  It is so easy to just Insert the cord into the USB port. This fan is very practical and also makes a perfect gift for any of your friends and family. The soft foam blade is great for safety,it will not do hurt to your body.  This fan is not too loud and is a perfect addition to my desktop."
1.0,still no speaker or headphone jack?  how are we supposed to sync with audible books?
4.0,"The color looks a little different from the screen, but it's nice anyway, and can protect my writing tablet"
5.0,"No problems encountered and seems perfectly compatable with the S4...  Can't even tell when you are using something off the card or off the phones internal memory.Note that up to 32GB it requires the HC cards,  from there to 64GB it requires the XC version.Happy with this purchase so far."
1.0,"I bought this card and it worked OK, at first. After about three weeks I noticed that some images were not showing up, a week later it began to loose everything. My Note 2 was failing to recognize it, inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files. Multiple formats by either the comp or Note 2 did not fix the problem, even tried some tools that I used for my DSLR, still no-go.This could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning."
4.0,Good
4.0,"This thing is incredible.  A little heavy for long term holding, but the quality of the device is unmistakable.  I really like the newer Remix 1.5 OS (operating system) and I have been able to use it for supplementing my work laptop.  Now my laptop stays in it's docking station and I take the tablet everywhere I need to go."
3.0,works ok good fit
5.0,I love this skin and get so many compliments on it
4.0,"Works fine to read, write, and boot from SD card. SD card will most likely be bottleneck not this adapter."
1.0,Doesn't fit snugly on keys impossible to get all it to fit right
1.0,"Great product until it dies after 3 months. Toshiba claims to have a 1 year warranty, but they don't answer their support 800 number, and that's the only way to get warranty service. So if it dies, like mine did, then you're totally screwed. These days you'd think they would offer support through live chat or email or something, or even an online form, but they don't. After calling at two different times and waiting on hold for a half hour and still not being able to talk to a person, all I can do is strongly recommend you choose a different brand. Their hold message doesn't even give you any hope that somebody will pick up, like &#34;thanks for your patience, there are 2 people in front of you&#34;. NOPE! they don't do that. Their complete lack of support is extremely discouraging, and really makes their warranty useless. You can't send it in for repair until you talk to a support person to get an RMA number."
4.0,"Although the price is notably better than the Apple store product, the capacity to hold its charge is less than the Apple battery.  However, if you primarily use the laptop plugged in, or have frequent access to the plug, this is a great option.  Furthermore, installation was very easy with the supplied screwdrivers."
3.0,Works ok.
1.0,"Received defective unit, it initialize as usb cable, but nothing happens after that. Tried to connect it to my Mac and it didn't even show up. The first generation looked tiny and it had LED activity indicator."
5.0,I don't know what else that I can add to other 5 star reviews except to say that this installed flawlessly in my Nook HD+.
5.0,"needed more room on the phone and I picked this card up. Popped it in and let the phone format it, works just fine. Specs say that this phone max out with 32 GB card but that's just not true.  Really glad I got this card, it's fast so when I am taking photo's in burst mode it moves every one.... Not missing out on photo's due to a slow card."
3.0,"Very fast shipping, fan works well. Feels a little bit cheap compared to other brands but only took off 1 star. I took off another star because the installation turned into a custom job. I had to pre-drill the already pre-drilled holes so that I could use the provided screws. If you need to plug your fan directly into your power supply then this is the one you want since it has the 3 speed feature. If you don't get a fan with a speed override then it will run at 100% all the time and it will be loud, unless you plug it into your motherboard. My MSI motherboard only had 2 fan headers so I needed a fan that I could plug directly into my power supply and could still adjust the fan speed."
3.0,no comment
3.0,My laptop wireless card is better than this
2.0,Fits snug but the rubber finish is pilling off.
2.0,"I decided to go with this model because it specifically had a 2K resolution ans 144hz refresh rate. I went through two of these monitors. The first one I got with all of my excitement built up was dead right out of the box. Powered on but not display a single thing. Went through the return process and got another one a few days later and got it all up and working which you would think is great, however only after about a week of use, a yellow line displaying from top to bottom of the LCD was stuck as a massive eye sore to anything I was doing on my computer. There was absolutely no solution for it and the warranty process through acer was a nightmare just to getting started with them so I didn't send it in. Now, I could of gotten a THIRD replacement, but I decided to go with an Asus monitor as this model gave me issues that rendered this monitor with great &#34;specs&#34; a reminder of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34; I can see now why the price was pretty cheap for the bells and whistles I was asking for. The only reason this review is 2 stars is because it showed me it can do what it was advertised to do, but only for a short period of time before a problem arose. PS: The Asus ROG Swift 27&#34; Monitor is a fantastic product."
5.0,Arrived fast.  Works with all my digital devices no issues.Haven't tested the speed yet but should be more than adequate for data transfer.
5.0,Works perfectly!! Thanks for a great product.
2.0,It's 20 feet from my router on the other side of a wall (phone shows 4 out of 5 connected to main router) and the tablets speed is absurdly slow while connected to this thing. Maybe I can use it for spare parts in a project.
3.0,"It was easy to place the top cover but the ones inside the computer are not. It would be much better if each piece was separate for the inside of the computer, but still with a few attempts it worked! ' This is my second decal from decalrus, the colors were much better on the first one. I would give it a 5 if the colors weren't so dark compared to the picture, if shipping was faster, and if it was easier to install the inside decals. But overall the designs get high compliments! '"
2.0,Does not fit AC56U router
3.0,"Responds well to movements. Changeable DPI. Adjustable buttons with downloadable logitech drivers. (from [...])<br /><br />Only thing I don't like is how the thumb buttons are relatively close together. Also no \\""back/forward\\"" function with a left/right click of the middle mouse button (Don't know how else to describe that action. But instead of a press down on the scroll wheel, it tilts left and right.) Would've liked that but since I don't really adjust my DPI settings I just use the DPI buttons for back and forward.<br /><br />Bought this in July 2015 and now the middle mouse button stopped working. Seems to be happening to others (based on a quick google search) so I'm a bit disappointed and I can't get it replaced due to the length of time so I am going to just have to buy a different mouse I guess."
3.0,Slow CPU therefore overall performance is hindered.  Neat and clean look.  Seems well made.  Keys are a bit &#34;mushy&#34; but tolerable.  You get want you pay for and at this price point this laptop is no surprise.
1.0,Can not activate because it is a comcast modem that is only for rental.
3.0,The sd reader only works half the time & usb slots may only work if one thing plugged in.
2.0,No applicable for gaming
1.0,Worked great...then didn't work at all.  I've had it for 5 weeks.  It's out of warrenty. We use it for an hour or two a week. That's it.  No troubleshooting this thing.  ;(
1.0,not what I expected
5.0,"This is my 4th Kindle.  I started with the Black/White with keyboard, graduated to the 7&#34; Kindle Fire, graduated to the 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire H.D. (used it for almost 3years) and just recently upgraded to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX.  Each time I have upgraded I have been extremely pleased.  The features on this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 that I am really enjoying is the processing speed and the addition of being able to use Bing for searching.  I continue to choose the Amazon Kindle products because of the reliability and great customer service."
4.0,Good product for a good price.
3.0,Ok
2.0,Wasn't what I was expecting.
3.0,"Be careful about this case. It does not provide much room for the micro-USB / HDMI / audio cables to be plugged in. If there's any sort of casing or plastic around the ends of the cables, you'll have to break/shave it off to get it in there."
4.0,"The mouse is quite a bit smaller than the one I am use to, though the curve on the sides could be handy if you have smaller hands. The keys work well and make only a small amount of noise. They are very rounded on the edges though, which has been causing my fingers to slip onto the wrong key at times, when typing very quickly. I will probably get use to this design, but minus one star because the very rounded keys are different from most standard keyboard models."
4.0,"Stiffer and thicker than regular, indoor Cat5e, but the jacket is very tough and the gel flooded construction bodes well for longer life in damp, underground installs.<br /><br />We've used nearly the entire box for five POE camera runs outdoors."
4.0,SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...Works fine.
2.0,"got this cord connected it to my computer my screen looked terrible .i had someone come over to check what was wrong he said it was the cable ,he changed it and everything worked perfectly"
5.0,"Love this travel mouse - it works perfect - great size, great feel"
1.0,Ordered two of these.  Both were DOA and had to be returned.  Ended up ordering a non-refurb that worked fine from another seller
2.0,"I did not get the screen protector in the package. The color is exactly what I wanted. However, it is not a perfect fit for my mac book air. I am having a hard time opening it my screen all the way. The two pieces are scraping against each other, its ruining the plastic. I am not sure if it will harm my computer, going to keep an eye on it."
5.0,Good price. I searched everywhere locally and couldn't find a better price. They work just fine in my Galaxy S4 and Tab 8.
4.0,"I purchased this to go into an external wireless connect drive that is made by the same manufacturer. Other than having to format it differently than the default (a very simple process), I have not experienced any issues with it."
2.0,Does not work. I plugged this into my pair of Steel Series Siberia v2's and I was still not able to use the built in microphone.
5.0,Great sound! Love it
4.0,"Pretty good product comfortable on lap easy to store too ,and very useful for homework specially with the light cup holder I haven't used yet."
2.0,"The edges are slightly sharp and the keyboard is a bit too spaced out. The display is decent, but nothing to write home about. What is really lacking is the touchpad. It is barely responsive. The left-and right-click buttons take a lot of force to respond as well. The sound quality was  pretty good at first but now after 6 months there is a constant crackling and popping sound. Windows 10 is extremely problematic, the only good thing is that start up is quick."
2.0,Works for kindle! Don't care for inside texture feels cheap
5.0,This is so far to good honest I can't can't complain I'm loving it.
2.0,"Unfortunately, I ordered this case for my sister in law and when it came, it didn't fit.  She has the iPad Air and it's smaller than the iPad 2,3,4.  I thought she had a full sized iPad. When I contacted Amazon they said they would send me a return label but the order was placed under a different email ID and I can't open the link to print the return label."
4.0,"Bought 2 for me and my wife Samsung Galaxy S2 phones.  Took photos and video and there is no issues at all.  Based on my previous experience on similar products I got for DSLR and other cameras,  this thing should last as long as or longer than all my electronics."
3.0,"the cable is deteriorating and the inner wires are showing. Soon, it is going to split and stop working. Too bad it didn't last for long."
1.0,"This card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors. I used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times I formatted, it would only record for about a minute before failing again. I picked up a PNY card since and it has worked beautifully. Unfortunately, I've been swamped and forgot to return this card before my 30 days. Not happy about that!"
3.0,"When my girlfriend saw this bag, she commented, &#34;Ok, that one is cute!&#34; While this alone wouldn't detract me from liking it, it really is very small. Once my 13&#34; Macbook Pro is placed in this bag, there's maybe room for another notebook or small textbook.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's ok. You should recognize you're getting only $50 or so of leather bag...which is not a lot of leather bag. The hardware, leather, etc is all noticeably cheap, and it's very easy to spot the cut corners. The leather is quite stiff for how thin it is, possibly because of the lining. The look of the bag isn't too bad, though, so if you're looking for a cheap, decent looking bag that won't last too long or carry much at all, this may be worth it to you.<br /><br />Part of me thinks this deserves 4 stars for a product that roughly meets expectation for the price point, but I do want to emphasize that this isn't a high-quality product. Amazon does identify 3 stars as &#34;It's okay,&#34; so we'll go with it.<br /><br />2.13.16 Update: I just noticed this is the  most &#34;unhelpful&#34; voted review I've ever written. I checked, and sure enough, at time of writing, every single negative review on this bag older than a month has 19-20 unhelpful votes. Perhaps &#34;RusticTown&#34; (the seller) is about 20 employees strong? If you are reading this and sincerely feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to leave a comment with some feedback."
5.0,Not as fast as the new Intel's but the quality and price point is hard to beat!
1.0,The case doesn't fit my macbook pro 13&#34;.
3.0,"The actual fit and look of this keyboard are great. Unfortunately, the letters on the silicone don't match the keyboard letters. The following keys on mine are particularly bad (see photo): I, A, S, D, 2, etc. I can live with it, but it's definitely not a perfect product."
5.0,"As usual, SanDisk does not disappoint. The speed is incredible, as is the price. Although you can get a variety of different manufacturers, none are as reliable as this one."
5.0,Where else can you get legitimate micro sdhc 32 GB memory cards for this price. The speed is 30 MB/s. Fast low cost 32 GB. Cannot go wrong. Name brand. San disk. I got ripped off buying imitation unpackaged memory cards that only worked days.
1.0,"Had to return 2 times. After I got the second one, I didn't believe the board has a problem but the computer won't start. So I spent $50 to a professional to exam the parts and it turned out the board is defective again. It must be great board for price IF IT WORKS."
4.0,Am hoping this works well. It was difficult to install and if I had not had a computer I would not of been able to do it at all . With NO instructions included to read and follow . Other than that I am fine with it and it came in a quick manner. Thanks
1.0,Not useful
2.0,"Received my order, shipped from China, but found the chargers are not the OEM Original Equipment I have used since 2011.  As background, I own 8 actual, original chargers purchased from BlackBerry; some are wearing out so I wanted to replace those units.  Upon removing one unit from it's thin plastic bag, I immediately noticed the weight was off - it was lighter than my other chargers.  I then checked the plug blades - unlike the originals, they don't 'snap' into open position, rather the prongs are flimsy and do not stay in the fully opened position.  The USB cable is not covered in the same rubberized material, instead a more shiny, plastic sheathing is used and the overall length was off by approximately 6 inches (shorter).  Also, the plug end was not as finely made and used a different metallic connector, though it did fit into a device charging port just fine.  I've been testing on on a brand new device, and the charging rate is not what I would expect from a 1.8amp 5 volt charger - a standard, 1.0 amp charging plug is beating it to 100% charged, handily.  The wall-wart also became much hotter than the original models I own.  I will not be using these units to charge my devices."
3.0,Beware of size when buying these connectors.  I thought I was getting a standard sized HDMI male to female cable and the male side is HDMI mini.<br />Mistakes like this suck when you have to double pay to ship back and receive the right item.
2.0,make sure you get the right size. i got a smaller one for 15.6
4.0,"If your electronic calls for this size, you have to use it. But I hate it.  It`s too darn small to fool with. This one works well, but I will try to avoid this size in the futher."
3.0,Broke rather quickly
4.0,good
3.0,Quickly went bad. I used it for maybe 2 weeks. Better keep your receipt. Too bad i didn't.Bad deal. period.
1.0,"Poor quality, very thin wire to USB, ordered 11 and ALL broke off."
4.0,OK
4.0,"GREAT cheap little PC! For a, just over $100, all in one PC I have to say that I am impressed.  Don't get me wrong, its not awesome, but this little guy has far exceeded my expectations for what I payed.  I set mine up as a media center PC,  it was quite simple and it has been performing well. 1080p movies play flawlessly, and the systems seems snappy and quick in general. I am not much of a gamer these days, but the older games I installed played just as well as on my desktop. I only give it 4 stars because the audio could be better.  Actually the sound quality is fine, but when sound starts and ends(like when you play a movie), you hear a little click as the audio device kicks in/out.  A little annoying, but certainly not a deal breaker! Don't listen to the reviews who say  the storage is only half of the ad... its only because it has a dual boot with Android 4.4, which you can delete."
2.0,It's cute but it's hard to hold on to.
2.0,The company provided zero instructions on how to use it.  They assumed it was obvious -- it wasn/t.  I threw it away
4.0,Good price for a good size micro SD.  Not the fastese card that I have used but for the price I am satisfied.
4.0,"The first keyboard that I received from Anker had problems. It was perpetually falling asleep and woke up when it felt like it.... Much like our teenage children... After posting a review here on Amazon, Anker went above and beyond the call of duty and took it upon themselves to send me another keyboard to replace the original I had bought. This time it works almost perfectly aside from one tiny glitch. Otherwise it would be a perfect replacement for the original Apple keyboard. The glitch it minuscule and most people will not run into it I'm sure. It deals with a 3 key sequence needed in Photoshop to 'step backwards' using alt-command-z. Photoshop doesn't recognize the command key in that sequence. I remapped that command with other keys so it's a non-issue. Otherwise, the keyboard 'feels' really good to use. Tapping the keys just feel much nicer than they did with the Apple keyboard! No worries of dead batteries like the Apple either though I'd still prefer the keyboard had a longer or user controllable time out. I'd rather recharge it once a week and leave it on and active 24/7 than to wait the few seconds for it to turn on. The new keyboard is much easier to wake than the last one. Service from Anker really was phenomenal. I give the company credit for their quick action to please a customer! For that reason alone, I'd recommend this keyboard. Enjoy!"
5.0,This DisplayPort to HDMI adapter cord works well without any drivers or software support needed.  It is truly plug and play between an HDMI component and a full sized DisplayPort component.<br /><br />I have used this to connect my laptop to a monitor on several occasions and it works without a hitch.<br /><br />This product was provided to me as a review item and this is my unbiased review of this adapter.
4.0,Mounting bracket works as advertised
2.0,This mouse seems to lag alot and occasionally freezes up and I have to unplug it and replug it to get it to work again. For the money spent I am very disappointed.
4.0,Great product!
1.0,"The description is quite confusing - it says at same time class 10, which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mb/sec, and at the same time, it says UHS-1, which means 30mb/sec write speed. The truth, as usually, is somewhere in the middle, but close to lower end. I have a dedicated, high speed PCI-E cardreader, which I use for chip benchmarking. So, this card showed 12mb/sec sequental write speed and 34mb/sec sequental read speed. So, UHS-1 is ""true"" only for read operations, meaning that if you wanted this card to speed-up your digital camera speed photography - you've made the wrong choice. Just for reference, this cardTranscend 16 GB Class 10 microSDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GUSDHC10has sequental write speed of 17mb/sec and sequental read speed of 24mb/sec. As you see, the cheaper transcend has average 40% faster write speeds!"
2.0,"They keys are good and it has a solid weighty feel, but the touch pad is almost unusable."
4.0,"It's what I wanted and performs perfectly. Everything works great, the menu system is awful. I'd go 5 stars if the menu system were better."
2.0,"Worked good, neat to watch.  Conversation piece, then it died after a month..."
1.0,I never really got it in operation
5.0,I never faced any issues ...so far..so good. It works well with my tablet. It is super fast and reliable.
1.0,I have lost my data 3 times with this card. I don't know if it's the card or the S3. My data always ends up as unrecoverable pieces in the LOST.DIR directory the phone creates the first time you insert the card. I don't trust it to hold anything I cant afford to loose.Update: I purchased aKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBlast week as a replacement. It hasn't lost any data yet. I'll update here again if it has the same issue.Update 2: TheKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBhas been in my phone for 2 months with no data loss. It is the better product.
2.0,"This mouse had potential! It's extremely comfortable, and the build quality is good. I love the palm rest and the button layout is great. However, it has a few glaring flaws with it that make this mouse unusable for me. First and foremost, it jitters, making it impossible to use for gaming. I primarily play League of Legends, and when your cursor suddenly stops working right it's very easy to lose track of it, which is a huge problem. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it's very annoying and usually causes me to die. Any amount of jitter is inexcusable in a mouse that advertises itself as a &#34;gaming mouse&#34;. Another problem this mouse has is the placement of the DPI button. The way the mouse is held causes your middle finger to lie very close to the DPI button, and it's pretty easy to accidentally hit it when gaming. Not a huge deal, but also very annoying.<br /><br />I also think the way these reviews are configured is pretty dishonest. The 2000 reviews are not for any one particular mouse, but rather all of them averaged together. Since when has that been okay? Anyways, from my experience I'd suggest against this mouse. I may have gotten a lemon, but even a replacement would still have the horrible DPI button placement, so I'll be going a different route."
1.0,the video hole was off centered.
3.0,"I like the drive but one time the shell came off the board with the chips when removing it from a laptop.  After I re-inserted the shell back on, it seems to function still but not sure why it came off in the first place?  Maybe I received a dud?"
4.0,"It's the top end besides the stupid expensive Extreme.  It works fine.  I've had 4-5.  I'd get cheaper ones which I suspect are about as good, but slow or fail isn't worth it to me to save a couple bucks.  This just work, and work fast."
5.0,Does what it should
3.0,I returned this ! I didn't like that it didn't have a brightness button ! U couldn't even see it at night !!
3.0,I replaced a link system E4200 with this high $$ one. Wireless reception outside isn't as good in my garage as the 4200 which is less expensive.  Was disappointed. This 9200 even has antennas and the 4200 doesnt.
3.0,"For anyone looking for seven USB ports to charge you phones, tablets etc. when plugged into a wall (A/C), this isn't it.  When plugged into a wall only the TWO USB ports work, the other five do not.  The other five only work when you also plug in the included power/USB plug to your computer.  So to have all seven working, you need to be plugged into a wall AND plugged into a USB on your computer.  I made the mistake ordering this for my vacation so I could charge all my phones and families devised with JUST the A/C power chord."
1.0,Unable to read.It says it's blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format.
2.0,You get what you pay for. My camera demands that it be formatted every few power cycles. I guess it will be just a mass storage device from now on.
5.0,"I used this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 . Like the others are saying, it had to be formatted in Fat 32. You can put your apps on your SD card with an app called ""Link2SD"". You just have to partition the SD card in order to be able to use it. Whether you get this card or a smaller one, you need one period for the Tab 2 because you can't do much without a wifi connection if you just have the internal memory and you want to download a lot of apps."
2.0,"Error messages pop up about software.  Does not load properly. Screen goes blank at times.  You get what you pay for, next time I'll buy &#34;new&#34; .  Save your money and buy &#34;new&#34; computer from a store."
5.0,I have several of these microSD cards I found that it's easier to have one for each camera that I have and with the price of these cards you can go wrong.. I have a total of 10 and not one of them has failed!
4.0,Stretches out of shape eventually.
1.0,Right fit but stopped working within a month.
1.0,If I could figure out how to use it....  No instructions with it.  I've never used it in all the time I've owned it  :/
4.0,Product as advertised... good quality... nicely flexible... worked good...
4.0,Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card.I would recommend this card to everyone.
1.0,"Worthless product I read all the good reviews and thought to give it a try but these chargers don't work at all, really touchy and will randomly just stop charging your phone. WASTE OF MONEU"
1.0,impossible to fix and charger breaks quickly// I reaaly liked this alot but the charger broke quickly and also the port. Brought it in to be repaired and the repair was more costly than the tablet & they advised me to toss it// only one charging port so I am out of luck//such a shame that a nice item like this lasts such a short time// spend more and get something you wont have to throw out. Not Happy!
5.0,"Everything was good, timely and in working order."
4.0,"Fits great, one of the little feet has already come off. They sent replacements but whatever."
4.0,This cable is satisfactory.  The cable is a little thin.  I damaged a good USB cable because it was persuaded into a right angle turn which eventually broke the cable.  I would pay more for a stronger cable.
5.0,64 GB additional memory for a great low price.  SanDisk provides exceptional quality at an affordable price.  Easy to install.
2.0,"The length was great, but it stopped working after a month or so.  The phone would keep buzzing like when you first plug it in to charge."
1.0,"This card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage (very few pictures had been saved to the card), where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying (thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card)."
2.0,Not the best
5.0,Need a little longer cable.  Worked great.
4.0,"While this is a very nice case and the keyboard has a great feel, it is inappropriate to state that this is usable on a 10 inch tablet.  The box that the case comes in is a better appraisal of the case stating that it is for a 9 to 9.7 inch tablet.For the LG tablet, the case is about 1/4 inch too narrow and provides no protection for the sides of the tablet.  I might have tolerated the case but it was also defective.  The bluetooth would not connect.  For a smaller tablet, I would say that the case is ideal.  After reporting that the item was defective to Amazon, they contacted the company who immediately sent me an e-mail to make sure I ran through the check list of things to prove that the case was defective.  I told them everything I had tried and they immediately gave me full credit for the item and said to not send it back to them.  That is what I call great customer service and has resulted in my changing the review from 2 to four stars.  As I said, this is a great case if your tablet is a bit smaller than 10 inches or if you don't mind it being flush with the sides.  From their help, I would say that the bluetooth problem is not normal."
3.0,"This case is a pretty sexy and svelte case for it's price point.  I ended up returning mine principally because I make regular use of my keyboard and thought it can function and be stowed with the keyboard attached - not enough contact is made between the magnets on the keyboard and edge of the Surface Pro 3 to actually stick (when keyboard is in it's elevated position).  My other concern is ventilation.  The cut-outs along the top and the side of the case don't align well (or at all) with the vents the SP3 requires to release heat.  Coupled with the case holder itself hugging the entirety of the device, the design doesn't allow for much heat dissipation.  If you use your SP3 mostly in tablet mode and don't do heavy duty anything (i.e. no games), the this case will work fine for you."
3.0,"Great range -- but couldn't get any of my devices to be able to connect to the internet through it, even though I had it connected per the instructions.  I am a fairly tech savvy person, and I still had trouble with this despite all the troubleshooting.  The same thing happened when my friend who is very tech savvy had the same problems.<br /><br />Maybe it was just my router?  I don't know -- but for some reason there was the issue of not being able to connect to the internet through the extender.  Totally bummed this didn't work out the way I thought it would.<br /><br />If it did work, I'd obviously rate this a 5-star."
3.0,"Did not fit the tablet I bought it for. It only fits certain models. I sent it back after getting the ok to do, but never got my credit."
4.0,"This bag is the perfect size for school. I can fit my notebooks and laptop with no problem. The side pockets can fit a small water bottle, but it would probably stretch it out. The only reason I didn't give this bag 5 stars is because, the cross body strap is cheaply made. It would break with the amount of stuff I carry"
2.0,It's smaller than I'd expected and so lightweight that it tips.  It might be ok for a child.
1.0,Didn't work
1.0,This item does not work on Apple MacBook Pros. Do not buy if you are an Apple user.
1.0,drive failed with irreplaceable files on it.  WD does not cover recovery - even under warranty. I would only use this for transferring large files between computers or for files you don't care about.
1.0,The letters and numbers on the keyboard cover I received were not centered on each key. You could not use the lights on your keyboard with this due to the off-centered lettering. Also the color was not as bright as the photos online. I will be returning this
3.0,"Everything did not download I.e. photos, games, Facebook,, iTunes.  A lot of password s disappeared.  I.  Would not do this again.  I am a senior and not very good with this stuff.  I need easy and automatic.."
1.0,"Sorry guys, this one absolutely does not work with the 3-prong adapter.  You all who say it does are probably referring to [[ASIN:B000BTL0OU Kensington Travel Plug Adapter with USB Charger (33346)]].  I am currently in Germany and brought both... I had the one in the link already and bought this one instead of a duplicate because I liked the fact that it has 2 built-in USB ports.<br /><br />I was planning to use both with my two [[ASIN:B00ATZJ5YS Belkin SurgePlus 3-Outlet Mini Travel Swivel Charger Surge Protector with Dual USB Ports (2.1 AMP / 10 Watt)]].  It works with the one shown in the link, exactly as people describe.  You can get the grounding pole into the rectangular 'hole' just fine.  See the photo of the rounded/mickey mouse style adapter that has the 3-pole halfway in to show the feasibility.<br /><br />On this adapter with the 2 usb ports, however, that hole is further from the two prongs and the grounding pole does not reach.  There IS a blank cover that is in the perfect place and size on the other side of the prong slots, but it is covered off because the electronics for the usb ports are directly underneath it. Two photos included of this newer, rectangular adapter that shows it does not take 3-pole.<br /><br />Overall, incredibly disappointing, and you guys need to check your facts.  If you still believe it is possible, reply here and post a photo of this EXACT adapter with a 3-pole being utilized.<br /><br />Frustrated with Kensington for a poorly designed 'newer model' and with the claims it takes a 3-pole.  Returning upon arrival back in the States."
4.0,As expected.
2.0,"The problem is more Window 7, that piece of s*** operating system that came with it. Slow as molasses with no added programs except for security software needed because of,,,,,,,,,,Windows being s***. Why sell a new computer with that operating system?"
4.0,"The plug is great, the wire is a little wimpy, but it works well."
5.0,PERFECT
1.0,Buttons already broke and it jumps and freezes doesn't work for gaming.
5.0,"Meets my needs, stays connected with minor maintenance."
2.0,"Well, it does charge my Chromebook.  I didn't believe what the other reviewers said about it affecting the trackpad so I bought it anyway. My mistake! It really DOES make the cursor move erratically, I just use it for charging when the Chromebook is shut down. I hope It's not going to mess up the battery or some other component. I'll keep it as an emergency spare."
3.0,"I'm using this with an Asus N550JX Laptop and as others have commented it doesn't wake the screen after sleeping.  Usually unplugging it and plugging it back in works, sometimes I have to power cycle the monitor.  I'll be looking for a replacement, just wanted for others to be aware of this issue."
2.0,Maybe some would like this style but I don't like it and wish I didn't buy it. The method to raise the screen is awkward. You have to slide out the silver arm until the desired level is obtained. Case seems sturdy and keyboard does respond.
2.0,"Sorry to say but I have to pull down rating from 5 to 2. The card went bad in just couple of months. No option to return as its beyond policy.The card came on time, good packaging and works so what else to add for this 16 GB SD card."
1.0,"the case I received does not click onto the MacBook in some areas. also, there are multiple dark scratches that are terribly visible on the gold MacBook. I will be returning this shortly and getting a Kuzy case."
4.0,Pockets could use a little more room. If you use the front pockets with anything bulky the flap won't stay shut with the magnets. Very protective case and overall I like it. Very nice looking
2.0,Overall it's probably worth the price but it's very heavy and the laptop restarted instead of shutting down on multiple occasions when I in fact clicked on Shutdown. Hopefully there are no other hardware (?) issues in the future.
2.0,"Bought this in May, and it already doesn't work. Dead. Very disapointed."
