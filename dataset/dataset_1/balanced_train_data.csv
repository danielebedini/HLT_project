1910,H. Al-Harethi,"I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computer's card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.",2012-10-31,768,5,2,7,3,0.7142857142857143,0.3589344518326193,3.0

3482,"Occasional Reviewer from Michigan ""Mark""","It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.

The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.

123,Aleksandar Milivojevic,"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good?

I've been through the SanDisk literature looking to see if there are any restrictions on their use, other than as ordinary &#34;flash memory&#34; for file storage.  There are no restrictions I could find.  What I have found is that these 128 gb cards (and a SanDisk 64 gb card I bought previously) cannot accept 62 gb of data written from a computer without suffering errors.  I've had to resort to copying no more than 1/3 gb of data at a time to these cards, stopping, then starting another 1/3 gb until the complete data is copied.  The errors actually occur early on, at approximately the 2 to 3 gb point.  I have several other 128 gb flash memory sticks - the Lexar Echo series, as well as a hundred other lower-capacity flash memory cards, and do not have this overflow/error problem with any of those.

2018,Hubert Farnsworth,"UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often).

4212,SkincareCEO,"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless..

I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted.

Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together.

(9GB on my super-slow, super-cheap plastic school-kid USB thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes.) So then I tested it on various known computers with typical raw and JPG picture files.

4423,"T. Brown ""TB""","Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",2013-08-20,475,1,0,1,1,1.0,0.2065493143772374,3.0

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013.

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof.

So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate.",2013-05-29,558,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",2013-01-13,694,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,5.0

I have a lot more choices if I am only looking for a class 10 card.Indeed, microSD cards are usually slower than full-size SD card. They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great.

The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly.Then one day I decided to protect my data prior to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone.The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don't know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SanDisk has shown itself to have great customer service and I really appreciate them exchanging the card. I will definitely not encrypt it anymore.

I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) ""sd card safe to remove"" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the ""unexpected"" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it's own accord.

The price is great for the size, for that I give it 5 stars. The transfer speeds are just disappointing though.. taking 5 minutes to transfer an iTunes movie file is a long time.. it'll take hours to fill the full card..

2799,Lazer Fers,"I purchased the card in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty sure it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right.",2012-10-20,779,1,1,2,0,0.5,0.0945312057342307,4.0

With the bright read and light grey color, it is much easier to find, because it will not blend into common background.Also, the quality looks good, not like some of the MicroSD cards, this is a ""unibody"" design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits.

1763,Gearhead Mania,"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk.",2012-08-26,834,3,2,5,1,0.6,0.2307242812760128,4.0

722,Brett in Denver,"The description on the Amazon page calls this a class 10 card with UHS-1 performance.  And while technically correct, (Full HD 1080p recording).

I have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed.  My Kingston 8GB SDHC Class 4 writes at 11.854 MB/s.  Now keep in mind the Sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes.
