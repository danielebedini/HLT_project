1.0,"I bought 2 of those SanDisk 32 GB microSD , used them on my Galaxy Note and Galaxy S4First one , my phone started saying it was removed , then recognize it again :) then diedI thought it's just a luck , plugged in the 2nd one :) stayed for about 2 months and died suddenly ! and lost everythingnever buying from SanDisk again .. ever"
1.0,"I bougth this micro SD card after some trubles with other that i got from Kingston, i can tell that SanDisk is other quality, this is the best, my i9300 phone can read a 64GB very fast, the dta transfer speed from my pc to my is amazing, if you are looking for additional storage to you phone, for music, pictures and other type of files, this is for you.Pros-Very good quality materials of construction-Amazing speedUpdate after one year this memory is damaged I can not delete or put new files on it, I can not format this memory, I tried to format with my phone, with my pc, with a camera and nothing, now this is like a 64gb cd, the data in the memory is only available to read but I can not move, or delete it, I bought this memory to be used to backup all my data of my android device but now is only a readable memory I can not write data on it any more, I hope sandisk make a better products in the future!!! Total disagree I will buy a Samsung memory card expected a better quality."
1.0,"Ordered this for a Galaxy S3.  Lasted a few months and then broke.  Is not accessible on several different PC's.Says ""limited lifetime"" warranty - BS.  You have ONE MONTH for Eco Zone.  Not only did I lose pictures but now I am out $$ because of a crappy return policy.In the future I will be buying Kingston, not Sandisk.-----------------Update:  Amazon Customer service made good and refunded my purchase price.  I still will not be buying any more Sandisk memory cards however..."
1.0,"I have an old SanDisk SD card that still works. I thought their new cards would be just as reliable, but I was wrong.The microsd card failed yesterday inside my phone. I used the adapter to connect it to my computer, but it wouldn't mount.I bought this directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor, so I know it's genuine SanDisk."
1.0,"I bought this on August of 2013.  As of April 2014 the card stopped functioning.  It can still be read, but the writing capability is gone.  That's less than one year.  I'm extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card.  My usage of it has been on my Galaxy S4.  I have about 40Gb of data in it.  Guess I'm going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one."
1.0,"I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  I'm glad their returns are so easy!"
1.0,"Had to return this item, it would not fit properly into the adapter that it came with.  Return was no problem, but I am reluctant to buy another one."
1.0,"Having used SanDisk before in my photography, I of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new Samsung Galaxy S3 with an internal microSD card. I spent the extra bucks over comparably ""no name"" Micro SD cards and bought this variant. I took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so I coud show it to friends on the go.After less than two months, the SanDisk microSD card started acting up. It was not recognized, stopped, restarted, removed itself, reinstalled itself onto the phone - erratic behavior. Here is where I should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything I could before things hit the fan...unfortunately I waited too long and this morning, for no other reason than I turned my phone on, the card shows up as blank. Neither my Windows PC, nor my Mac, can even detect the card and yes, i tried two different adapters, and I tried the SanDisk recovery which ""found no recoverable files"" even though I checked all file type extensions.I've apparently lost all the pictures I had on there. To top it all off, my GF's cheap ""no name"" card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrily.Paying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months? No thanks. I'm going back to Lexar, which hasn't failed me yet. I'm also getting rid of all my SanDisk cards for my DSLR's, just in case. The fact that SanDisk is the first card thats ever failed on me, and a new card to boot, does not inspire confidence. Buy and use at your own risk."
1.0,"I am very disappointed in this card.  I usually don't have an issue with SanDisk, but this 32GB ultra card died after two months.  Died as in, no longer recognizable by PC / Camera or any device.  Now I have to wrestle with warranty claim."
1.0,"I bought this card for my android based phone, soon I started getting messages that my card had been removed and or it was damaged, Tried it in my tablet same thing, and this was not the first card of this brand that I had bought that experienced this problem. Went to several online forums to see what the solution is; then someone hit upon it, it just might be a problem with this brand of cards.I bought a PNY brand micro SD card and had no problem whatsoever."
1.0,"I bought this card on the strength of the 64GB XDSC SanDisk in my phone right now.  It was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first use.Initially it worked fine, then dead.  We checked in a laptop and Windows Disk Management screen told me it had a single 128K partition and the rest was unusable.  Outstanding.The replacement sent by Amazon (Thank you Amazon, you are always excellent) is sitting in my office right now, I should probably check it out."
1.0,Worked fine in my Samsung S4 for one year.  Then it stopped allowing writing to the card.  Would not format even on a PC or with another device.  The data is still there but cannot be erased.
1.0,"My card got so hot it almost melted. Crazy! But you card somewhere else, I know I Wii! I'm not taking the chance of ruining one of my devices. No thanks"
1.0,"Received one - didn't work. Not readable on my Mac or my Win 7 PC. Tried another - retail packaging and is raw format and although my Galaxy S3 sees it, it won't write or format and the computers don't pick it up either.Taking the other person's 1 star review and trying a class 6. Can't afford to lose data, not that I can write to these anyway. Both went back."
1.0,"If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn't format it.  The camera and tablet couldn't format it.  I RMA'd it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn't last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I'd received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD's or regular SD's I have or use don't do this.  I think SanDisk has an issue with this card.The last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card.  Both cards had different date and origin codes."
1.0,"Does not work.  I have a card purchased at Best Buy that looks identical side by side.  BUT!  Transferring music onto the Best Buy purchased card was extremely fast.  100+ meg albums transferred in 2 to 3 seconds.  On these cards, a 61 meg album was at 18 minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred.  I bought two, so I figured maybe a bad card.  Tried the other, same thing.  Extremely slow.  Wonder if they are even real."
1.0,"Card is Good. I ordered one before and it performs as one would expect, so I ordered another. It took much longer to attempt get the second one so I wrote and got a refund. Seller, NMicro Technology,  was not the same as the first."
1.0,"the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything."
1.0,"had it in my samsung tablet and it went bad after 2 months, wont let me reformat or read it or do anything with it. money down the drain."
1.0,"I got the micro sdcard 64gig, I reformated to fat32 and works very well on my galaxy s2 i9100 with no problems at all, thanks:DEDIT: After 7 months of using this memory card, now i tried to format it but it wouldn't, i tried about 5 different methods and none of them worked, i wouldn't recommend buying this one: SanDisk Ultra 64GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS Memory Card Speed Up To 30MB/s With Adapter, Frustration-Free Packaging - SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A. Avoid buying it or you will experience problems in half a year."
1.0,"I purhased this thinking I was getting an amazing deal.  The price was right, the product was not.  After a few months I am unable to delete or add files, pics or music to this microsd card.  I am only using 28gb of space on it.  I cannot add anything, nor delete anything, it won't even allow me to format it and start fresh.  I am not happy with this product and extremely disappointed.  I use my phone a lot and store music and pictures on my phone for various purposes.  I would recommend buying another 64gb microsd card.  One that is more reliable."
1.0,"Ordered this from Amazon and was expecting it to work perfectly like my other 32GB sandisk (in my galaxy s4). However, I was really disappointed that upon placing it in my note 10.1 2014 edition the card become unrecognizable. I tried reformatting on the computer, on the phone, and yet, no prevail. It could be the firmware or current update of android, but the point is that, if other companies can make a card that works, why not do the same? Maybe I got a bad batch, who knows...I went ahead and ordered the G.Skill microsd card and now it's working perfectly. I'm s"
1.0,"I really want to like these and I do trust SanDisk more than other manufacturers of memory cards. That said, I'm moving on to my 3rd card. Thank you Amazon for having exceptional customer service, or else I'd be very upset.Basically this card will suddenly not allow writing to it anymore. You can't save files to it, you can't delete files from it and you can't event format it. I've tried doing all three in different OS'es and devices with no luck. Doing some reading on the SanDisk forums this seems to be happening a lot with these cards.I'm returning this to Amazon and trying my luck with a different brand to see what happens."
1.0,"randomly erases all my data and asks me to format card on my unmodified unrooted sprint Galaxy SIII ,i dont know how scandisk is selling these,i trusted the brand and it didnt work"
1.0,"I had this for my smart phone and it kept dismounting itself.  I did some research and found out that there are others experiencing the same problem.  So, I returned this and got Transcend instead.  Transcend works fine with no problem."
1.0,"This card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress (which does shorten the life of the card - it was not written to over and over in the phone).The card is now totally unwriteable - on a Mac, a Linux machine, or the phone - writes all ""seem"" to succeed but even low-level reformats don't actually *do* anything - the exact same files are there after every change, untouchable and frozen forever.10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this (neither the Mac, Linux machine, or phone reports any error) is not acceptable quality from SanDisk."
1.0,"I have had this for 8 months, and the SD Card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures.  I have tried reformatting, and nothing helps.  Not cool.Update - April 2, 2014 - I contacted Sandisk and I am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement.  I hope this will resolve the issue with the card.  I will keep you updated once the process is complete."
1.0,This card failed after 2 weeks of use.  I have the same problem with their SSD failed on me after 6 months.
1.0,"Ive had the card for over a month, using it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.I filled the card with a few TV shows and movies to watch on the go, as well as many PDFs and MS Word Docs.The MS Word and PDF files often get corrupted after use. THe larger files seem to stay intact. I moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem since.Im hoping Sandisk has a decent return policy."
1.0,"No way to format it. I even downloaded 2 programs that claimed were able to format it, After wasting about 6 hours, I decided to give up and send it back, The seller should format them before sending them, even if they would charge $5. extra, it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration."
1.0,I was better off with my 32gig card.  This thing was nothing but problems.  The phone does not see it half the time and it is SLOW.  The phone keeps asking to Re- format it.  I got it to see the card after a reboot.  It is still SLOW.I will be buying the Samsung 64gig card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 1.  I have seen good things from Samsung.
1.0,"Bought 2 of these for the wife's & my Android phone. When her's failed after 2 months, we figured it was just luck of the draw. Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell). Up until now I had an overall neutral to favorable opinion of them, not anymore.If you think I am overreacting, please just skim through a few pages submitted in springtime of 2013. There is at least one or more ""6 months and it failed"" reviews per page."
1.0,"Losing pictures, video, and tunes after 9 months on a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (stock android).  Looks like this is a common problem.  I will try my luck with Sandisk on Monday.  If I don't get a replacement, I will never buy a Sandisk product again.  I paid the premium for ""Sandisk Quality.""  I am very disappointed.UPDATE:Sandisk will be providing a replacement SD CARD.  However, my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced.  SanDisk lost their ""premium rating"" in my eyes. It's going to take a while for them to get it back."
1.0,Used for two months in Samsung Galaxy.  Fizzled then failed.  I have never experienced a memory card or or flash drive failure until this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB.  Will purchase a different brand next time.  Return for refund or replacement is not allowed.
1.0,"Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn't really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess."
1.0,"This does not appear to work with the Samsung Galaxy S3.  It worked for a few weeks, then my phone started giving me ""Unexpected Unmounted SD Card"" error messages.  After a bit of searching, people seem to agree that the S3 and Sandisk micro SD cards do not work together."
1.0,"I purchased a 64Gb Samsung SD card to expand the memory of the phone.However, I frequently get a message that the card has been removed or is recovering.Sometimes the problem clears itself, other times I have to reboot the phone.It also says ""MTP application will restart to prepare SD Card"". It then starts listing the restarting/recovering SD card.I eventually replaced it with a Sandisk 16gb microsd ""HD"" card from Walmart and it is operating fine.I have been reading a lot about people having issues with the 64gb sandisk cards and the Galaxy S4.I wish I had done more research before wasting $50 on what I thought was a good buy!"
1.0,"I put this in my Galaxy Note II and put a bunch of music and PDFs on it.  I also used it to save videos and photos.  It worked well for about 2 months then, on Christmas Day (today), it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank.  My phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the SDHC reader of my laptop doesn't work.If this is SanDisk Quality, then I am not impressed.  I am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but I'd rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after 2 months..."
1.0,"Do not buy, card failed on the third usage.  Kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.Then, it's a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to Amamzon inLexington, KY.The failed card was in a GoPro White Edition. Needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in November is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back.  Card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of April.  6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.Out of all the items I bought from Amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro SD card is too much.  I'll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.Refund Update, once again Amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig.  Amazon is where I shop for 2 reasons.  1. I live 50 miles frombig box stores and 2. they ALWAYS make things right with no muss ...no fuss.I replaced the dead card with Amazon brand Micro 32 gig SD micro card.I have purchased Amazon branded SD cards before and they work just as good as any.Not to mention the cost savings."
1.0,"I get randomly error messages with my nokia808, ""disk error-"" and the card stops working, its so, so sad.. I bought a cheap 8gb micro sd class 4 that works better than this :("
1.0,"I wish I could say this card was great. Been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64GB one (also SanDisk) which never gave me issues; sadly I lost it. This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn't recognize it. Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala. So that's $119 down the toilet. I have to buy a new one now, but I think I'll go for the new Samsung EVO ones (although they don't offer a 128GB model as of this writing - bummer)."
1.0,"I ran several tests both on my computer, and my phone it wrote at 6MB and read at about 6 to 10 depeneding on its mood. I bought this to replace a generic 32GB class 10 card that I lost (so dang small i droped it and could not find it. that Card actual wrote at 11 to 12MB and read at 20MB. I went with sandisk because my phone came with a class 2 that performs more like a class 6. What a waste of time. Refunded this item"
1.0,"Yeah. Ultra Hot. I could not get any of my devices to recognize this card. When I finally was, using a USD reader, I tried to format it. It wouldn't format and burned my fingers when I removed it. Others have also posted this. Maybe they are not all bad, but many are. Perhaps they are counterfeit, I don't know. But the hassle of having to return it isn't worth the $10 you may save."
1.0,"I've only had this Memory card for 3.5 weeks and it not only has recently started resetting, it intermittently loses contact with my Cell phone and the memory is lost, erasing everything on it!!!!!! Now I find out my return date has past and I'm stuck with a peice of s*** memory card that I can't do a damn thing about! Thanks a lot for nothing! I will never buy direct from here again!Also, I didn't realize I was supposed to have an adapter too? wow where the heck is that at???"
1.0,"This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely. I have tried every possibility to get this to work, but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones. Every workaround I have tried to get this card to work, it still causes my phone to freeze."
1.0,"This card worked in my Galaxy S3 right off the bat.  I did not need to format it or anything.  After about 2 weeks, I was watching a video on my phone and it locked up.  Then the phone showed that the card was damaged.  Now I am unable to copy anything over 100mb to or from the card.  Viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone.  Amazon customer service is great, however.  They sent me a new card.  I will update my review after I am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errors.****UPDATE****After having the second card for a few weeks, it also had the same issues.  Even worse, the card was completely unreadable after it locked up.  The card showed about 5 GB of data being used, but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer.  Sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty 16GB card."
1.0,"NOT GOOD REPEATEDLY SELF EJECTS FROM NEW GALAXY S4  RETURNED FOR EXCHANGE OR REFUND....BOUGHT TWO ONE WORKS WELL BUT ONE DOESN'T I GUESS IS DEFECTIVE....I HAVE TWO GAL S4,..IS WHY I BOUGHT 2..."
1.0,"I bought this to be able to load more music into my Verizon LG Android phone. I spent hours adding music to the card. Then, I put it into my Android phone. The phone did not read anything on the memory card. The other memory cards, 8GB and 32GB worked fine, so it must be a flaw in this memory card. Also, this memory card got stuck in my Android phone's slot. I had to use a utility knife with a very, very thin blade to pull out this card."
1.0,"There's a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there's a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device's internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they're what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn't going to stand by a counterfeit."
1.0,"I would not recommend this card if your looking for REAL class 10 write speeds. The most I could get is 9mb/s from this card but for the most part it was about 7-8mb/s. I even did a slow format to exfat in windows 7 with no improvements. I copied over music, pics and movies to test it out ranging from a couple of mb to over a gb. The read speeds were pretty good at around 21mb/s though. I popped in a 32gb class 10 transcend SD card and it consistently got 16-18mb/s write speeds and 24mb/s read speeds. So in conclusion I think this card is not really a class 10. Too bad I read all the negative 1 star reviews after the fact but I will be sending this one back."
1.0,"Worked great in my galaxy s4 and died about 2 months later, what a waste of a lot of money!"
1.0,Got this product and it was fine until it just stopped working...The last one I had that came with my DROID X on release day worked for the whole time since I got it without a hitch...I get this one and it's dead in less than 60 days...I don't know if I got a lemon myself or the whole supply is bad or faulty... All I have to say is I am very displeased!
1.0,"With all the great reviews on this card, I picked this up for my Samsung Galaxy S III. Popped in the card, and I was happy taking pictures, saving files, and living life.Fast forward two months later, and all of a sudden, the card stops functioning. My phone won't read it any more. My computer won't read it either. Submitted a ticket to Sandisk. Hopefully I can get a replacement that actually works.Thank goodness I saved all my photos on Dropbox."
1.0,"i still own it but card went bad after 2 weeks of owning it, lost tons of music and data ect and lost all faith in sandisk products. i tried to get it replaced or money back but no return email from seller, so unhappy i lost over 20gigs of movies/music and data. wish there would have been a reply from seller or amazon but i still have a dead sdcard with all my files stuck on it."
1.0,"This card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage (very few pictures had been saved to the card), where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying (thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card)."
1.0,This is a piece of crap. This is my 3rd card in 3 months. This is ridiculous.Do not buy this crap
1.0,"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card."
1.0,"I bought two cards for tablets.  The first wouldn't format, so I bought another GSkill Class 10. The second worked, but only for 3-5 minutes. Then error, or freeze.  I thought it may have been the tablets.  However, the Gskill worked in both.....So I called Amazon.  The customer service was excellent.  There ""may"" have been a problem with one of their vendors......They shipped out two new cards with Saturday delivery.  It was ""implied"" through lengthy conversation with the Amazon Agent, that there were numerous problems with a particular company/vendor.Lesson:  Do NOT Hesitate To Call And Return if you get a card that seems to have ANY troubles out of the pack.I was surprised that my initial review was removed  from Amazon....So I am leaving another about the return.  II tried everything to fix these cards: fat32 ntfs and the newest exFat.....  There are definitely some damaged cards out there so be wary, and do not hesitate to call customer service!"
1.0,"I purchased Sandisk because i thought it was the most reliable name brand out there. I have a Galaxy S3 and purchased this 32GB card to handle all my photo's and movies. I'd say over the last 4 months I haven't been using the storage for more than just photo's and the occasional movie. The device just failed on me yesterday, losing all my photo's and files. Thank goodness for DropBox auto-photo upload otherwise i would of permanently lost my photos.I actually went back to the Amazon branded microSD card (16GB) which is about as fast and so far, way more reliable than sandisk. I can't beleive a sandisk card failed, I'm probably going to RMA the unit and hope they send me a better unit. You can guarantee that i'm going to burn in the card to make sure there's no errors.I gave it one star because you think you pay a premium for a premium product. You expect it to be as near flawless as possible."
1.0,Had the 32GB SD Card for a 4 months before it died on me. Tried to swap it out and said warranty was only 60 days long. Last SanDisk product I ever buy.
1.0,I have lost my data 3 times with this card. I don't know if it's the card or the S3. My data always ends up as unrecoverable pieces in the LOST.DIR directory the phone creates the first time you insert the card. I don't trust it to hold anything I cant afford to loose.Update: I purchased aKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBlast week as a replacement. It hasn't lost any data yet. I'll update here again if it has the same issue.Update 2: TheKingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDC4/32GBhas been in my phone for 2 months with no data loss. It is the better product.
1.0,"Spent over $50 and the thing came fast and didn't work.  Neither my computer nor my phone could read it or format it.  I have had plenty of memory cards, so I know to unmount it with software.  Odds are yours will be fine, mine sucked,"
1.0,"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on."
1.0,"Atto Speed rating 2.7MB/sec write and 2.8MB/sec read.That barely makes it class 2, not class 10 as advertised.This is second time I have to return a slow card, I hope negative reviews will help bring attention to the widespread problem."
1.0,"If this was any more worthless, it would have a retched stench.  This card has completely turned me away from ever trusting another SanDisk product again.  I would only use this in the future to keep corrupt mis-information to frustrate anyone attempting to acquire any of my data.I have reformatted it 3-4 times IN FULL using various allocation sizes and operating systems.  It only functions under Windows, it randomly works in my mobile devices.  Now i'm left to decide if I want to bother researching this to better understand the problem in the future, or simply purchase another card from a more reliable manufacturer...... hello Kingston."
1.0,"If you have a Contour camera you want to use this with. It will not format! Don't even bother.Now I have room for about 16,000 photos. Not what I wanted."
1.0,"memory card failed mysteriously overnight, not sure why, but phone works fine with a different card.here, four more words"
1.0,"I got a card and it wouldn't let me copy files to it, it would (a) not recognize on any of the three computers or my android tab at home, and (b) unmount itself in the middle of file copies.  These two things happened randomly.  I got a replacement, but it suffered from the problem of letting me format it (yay, farther than I got with unit 1), then crapping out 300mb into a file transfer.AVOID THIS GUY."
1.0,"Could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and demanded a reformatting. Then after 5hrs of calls to Sprint & Samsung I got a guy who reads factory stuff!Samsung Galaxy SIII is a Class 4 & Class 6 supported Motherboard, with Qualcomm processor. The Sprint stores only sell Class 4 memory, and there is a reason that Camera memory~Class 10 is not sold there, the board, just like in a PC, has to support the data stream. It does not!If you have an Android Phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it! Even Samsung's USA website does not tell you the board supported memory! They won't, and don't tell who the board manufacturer is in this Galaxy SIII phone. I asked at the Texas Samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold, and they had no specs to even share. They don't get it!PASS IF YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE, UNLESS YOU GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER OF YOUR PHONE. I went through this same stuff building custom PC's with Intel motherboards. Memory has to be built to run on this board, at this speed, with this processor, or it will not work properly, and will crash, and lose data."
1.0,"I purchased this card (the 64GB version) to use in a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone. It worked perfectly for almost three months, at which point it just stopped mounting. The phone detects a card, but is incapable of formatting it. It's even worse on my computer, which does not even detect the card anymore (and yes, I'm using an SDXC-compatible USB reader).I contacted SanDisk for an RMA and they will probably replace it, although the replacement process is needlessly slow and painful.I had bought this card based on the glowing reviews, but I'm going to stay away from SanDisk products from now on."
1.0,"I hate it, it worked fine for 2 months and the after those 2 months it started with problems, first, every once and a while was not recognized by my device, and now 4 months after, I have to pull it out and then place it again in every hour.....It might have been just my microSd problem.... But I wont purchase one of this ever again"
1.0,Don't even waste your time buying this memory card. 64GB is written on it but its actually even less than 3GB that's in it.i have never experienced such deception.i had tried loading my pics and music and other data on it from day one but no matter what i did i won't take more than 3GB of data. i didn't realise till i read other stories of similar memory cards that will state 64GB but would contain a smaller memory capacity often times even less than 10GB.i bought this card for $49.what a big waste!!now i am so scared of buying memory cards on amazon or online elsewhere.i wouldn't dear it again!it was in a sealed  sanddisk packet so i was thinking it must be original.Alas!it was a big  waste!i have lost confidence in buying memory card on amazon.
1.0,"I've requested a replacement, so I'll update this review after I receive a replacement.  But the first card I got, it could be read, but every time I put it into the computer, it said there were errors with it.  It couldn't repair the errors.  I couldn't even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work.  I could create folders on the card, but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders.  I tried many many things and nothing worked.  I know SanDisk makes decent products, so I will change the review later."
1.0,"I wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky. Well it sucks being one of them. I cannot get this card to format not matter what device, software or technique I use. The mistake I made was that I didn't use the card right away to see if it was good -I thought, its a memory card, what could go wrong. Now I'm out of the US and returning it is not economically sensible. I don't know if it's quality control, but this card simply cannot work in any reader, device, with or without adapter (write protection off on the reader of course). The card shows up on devices, may even show data being copied then when you refresh, nothing has happened. All formatting software says it's write protected and nothing I do can remove it. Why would a new card come write protected anyway?  Very disappointing, especially since I lost data from my phone."
1.0,"These are genuine Sandisk memory cards, but from a defective batch.  I lost all of my photos and videos taken on my phone over the last two years because the card had a catastrophic failure.  SanDisk reps informed me the batch was bad and they were aware of the problem."
1.0,"I bought this card and it worked OK, at first. After about three weeks I noticed that some images were not showing up, a week later it began to loose everything. My Note 2 was failing to recognize it, inserted into the adapter and my comp could see it but not read all the files. Multiple formats by either the comp or Note 2 did not fix the problem, even tried some tools that I used for my DSLR, still no-go.This could just be a batch problem as the card looks legit and was fast in the beginning."
1.0,"forget loading this into your cart.  a one day pause and this junk went up 16.99, in ONE DAY.  I don't give money to aXXholes."
1.0,"I didn't  even have this card installed in my Motorola  Razor HD for 6 months when I turned my phone on yesterday and got a message stating I removed my card before properly unmounting it first even though it was still installed. I plugged it into my PC adapter and nothing! I lost about 300 documents and over 500 pictures, but i'm glad that I just backed up everything 2 weeks ago. Worked great until it died far to soon and without any warning at all. Be sure to backup all your important data frequently!"
1.0,Sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there. My lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip.
1.0,"Ordered it on 1/10/13, never received the first 2 sup[posed shipments then 32 days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit SD card that was detected as fake with H2TESTW software after writing only 71mb's it crashed several times. No hologram or individual serial number on the Chinese knock off packaging either. Make sure you know where they are coming from! Only buy these from reputable authorized dealers! It's worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration!"
1.0,"A month and a half after purchase...  My device powered off while the card was in use (batteries ran out).  Since then, doesn't work.  The device doesn't recognize it.  Doesn't respond to recovery, reformatting, partitioning... nothing.  I've used EaseUS, ZAR, HP USB Disk Format, and a couple others.  No dice.  Nothing can read it or fix it."
1.0,"Received two today and they have ""Made in China"" imprinted on them.  Although they were detected and formatted fine to capacity in both Samsung phone and tablet, lets see if they hold up and not suffer premature death like many have reported.  Thinking I should've gone with ""Made in Korea"" Samsung SD cards instead if they had 64GB size.Update: Bought two 12/2012 and one year later with very light use one of the cards started locking up the phone with ""wait or close"" prompt when deleting files off of it.  Should've gone with Made in South Korea Samsung card.  Sandisk is garbage these days."
1.0,dont even bother to try - will not show up in finder and will not show up if placed on any reader
1.0,"I got this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 (p6800) and it worked great for about 3 weeks - September 18 through today, October 7.  It just died while I had the tablet attached to my PC and was copying another file onto it, so I've changed my rating from 5 stars to just 1 star.  I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Another user warned me that this had happened to him after 4 1/2 months, but 3 weeks?!?!?!?!?  I've reported this to Amazon and asked for a refund.Stay as far away from this card as you can, at least for the Galaxy Tab 7.7.UPDATE:  Amazon refunded my money for this card, and I replaced it with the Samsung equivalent, which is STILL working perfectly.  Don't waste your time and money on this card - get the Samsung."
1.0,after 4 months it stopped working i got a new one form SanDisk but I'm very apprehensive to put it on my phone.
1.0,"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience."
1.0,"I just don't get what has happened to SanDisk quality.  It seems to have gone down over the years.  This product was glitchy from day one.  I thought it would be fine after a quick check disk, but then it only got worse.  After less than a week I have to return it.  What upsets me is that this is not my first bad experience with SanDisk products.  I used to buy them all the time, they were my brand of choice for flash memory (cards or thumb drives).  The last three products I have bought from them have had problems and failed either immediately or shortly after usage.  So I give up.  I will start looking to other companies for my memory needs.  I bought a Transcend to replace this.  I hope it works out better."
1.0,I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.
1.0,"Broke after  2 weeks.....I will go back to Samsung HD cards... This was a waste of time and money. Actually, I should ask for a refund"
1.0,"I have zero complaints, this card does exactly what it should. I'm amazed by how inexpensive memory cards continue to get. These things are really useful to throw on your keychain because they're so small.Update: From 5 stars to 1. Dead after 4 months. Appears to be a fairly common issue: [...] Let's see how the RMA process goes...."
1.0,"I got this for my brand new Nokia Lumia 810, but there is some kind of problem, the card is horribly slow, I can't record HD video to it, it studders.  I've tried reformatting several times to no avail.  I didn't have any of these problems with my old 32gb class 4 sandisk card...  There are other people having this problem as well, seems hit or miss.  I can't recommend this card at this time for this reason.EDIT:  I've contacted SanDisk and they are RMAing the card.  I'll improve the rating if the new card corrects the problem.EDIT: Got the new card, problem still exists...EDIT: I've suffered with this card for a year now, the only problem is that I cannot take video without studders, so I figured maybe software updates would eventually fix the problem.  They have not.  I have used multiple different camera apps, and the problem still persists."
1.0,"Major issues, bought FROM san disk but only worked briefly, now when I try to reformat it reports itself as a 30 meg removeable drive in both windows and macos--not sure if its defective or a mislabeled one--but got direct from amazon so just very disapointed. Will stick with transcend from now on I think."
1.0,"after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed. i bought the 32 gig class (10) card.i swore i picked ""original packaging"" but it was shipped with out original packaging... i will be returning this card for the following reasons:these tests were done using the sd card ports on my pc.my generic class (6) 32 gig card has upload speed of 22MB (write) and a transfer speed of 8.5.my sandisk i just bought, it has an upload speed peaking at 32MB (write) and a transfer speed of 6.5 to maybe 8.5 if im lucky.the write speed is ok, but why is the transfer speed so much more low. why isnt it at least 10MB if not 12MB if sandisk is typically so modest in their classifications?and whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card... i dont see class (10) anywhere on this card....amazon you will be getting this back!"
1.0,"First, it kept unmounting on the Galaxy Note 10.1I got it replaced.I used the replacement on my Galaxy S4 and it heats up my phone when charging. IT GETS VERY HOT. GS4 does not get hot with other sd cards. awaiting my second replacement."
1.0,Piece of crap died two months after I bought itI am sure that makes it on me to buy anotherGREAT!
1.0,"Used it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was ruined within a month.  Second one I went through on that phone.  Contacted Verizon, Samsung, SanDisk, Google, and read a lot of forums.  Turns out a lot of people were having the issue with that phone and these cards.Of course the girlfriend threw away the card so I couldn't return it, so I don't know if the issue was fixed or if was a bad batch of cards that went out or what.  It's been a few months and I haven't seen the problem as much as before, so I can only assume it was a bad batch.I've had another card in my phone for a while and haven't had any issues, so for now I can't recommend this specific card unless their issue has been addressed."
1.0,"Do not get this card especially if you plan on using it on an Android phone.  just google ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" and I found the problem is caused directly by this card.  I purchased a different brand and the problem immediately disappears.  Out of curiosity I tried mounting this card into a windows PC and on rare occasions the sd card does turn up empty, as if it was removed, so the problem is not limited to android.  I would avoid this card completely."
1.0,"I bought this with Costco Black Friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago.  Today when I was transferring video files from my phone to the card, I wasn't able to because it stopped half way.  Now, nothing can be written on it.It was purchased from Costco, so it's not a fake Microsdhc card.  I tested it out its authenticity with an app on Google Play and verified that it's real too.  Still, it's a piece junk.  What is Sandisk doing to its reputation?I would advise shopper to choose other brands over this.  Surely, it's cheap; but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it?"
1.0,"After a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenAlso, the I/O speed is not amazing, even for a Class 10"
1.0,Just started unmounting and remounting all by itself.  Really sucked the battery life for a while there. A quick google search showed this to be a common problem.  Oh well...
1.0,Crashed... Lost everything... Thanks SanDisk.  Used in gs4..not a solid product couple years worth of stuff gone in an instant.
1.0,"These have issues with gopro, do not use. The transfer speed is inaccurate, and gopro has even admitted it doesn't support this."
1.0,"I ordered this memory card for my Drift Ghost-S action camera. I started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem. I assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera. Same errors. I switched to a SanDisk Extreme card and never had problems again.If you're going to be recording HD video, especially at high frame rates then do not get this card. I'm sure it would be fine in any other scenario though, but it's advertised as a class 10/UHS 1 card and it's just not as fast as other class 10/UHS 1 cards.Drift Innovation (the company that makes the Ghost-S camera I use) has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any ""SanDisk Ultra cards"" because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors. They work ok until you try recording 1080p video at higher frame rates."
1.0,"It worked fine at a start and offered great speeds, but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day (at least once per hour).  That made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time.  I installed Watchdog and noticed that the Google+ process also incremented its CPU usage.  I read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microSD cards, probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted.  In another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation SanDisk microSD cards.Now I decided to purchase a Samsung one which can be found similarly priced.  My phone stopped acting up, and its battery life came back to normal."
1.0,"Fast card while it worked.  Died less than a week after return period expired....  Must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive.  Some fail, some last forever.  Not SanDisk's fault, not amazons fault - it is what it is.  BUT it is for this reason that i think Amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category.  Dont worry amazon, i still love you - but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one..."
1.0,"I bought it for my new galaxy note and I realized the device didn't recognize it...tried it on other devices, laptops, desktop, macbook didn't work...Very disappointed !"
1.0,"This card was dead on arrival and did not work whatsoever. When copying files to it, the transfer speed was below 1MB/s and then when I would eject the card the contents I just transferred would be lost. The card refused to format, I got an error message that the lock was on when it was not. Definitely a dud. I exchanged for a Kingston card of the same size which worked and still works flawlessly."
1.0,I don't notice any significant performance increase over the less expensive class 4 sandisk sd card.  I don't recommend this card.
1.0,"I have exclusively used Sandisk Extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have NEVER let me down. This one is a dud, though. I plugged it in, let my phone format it, and then start copying to it. Everything copied just fine, but after I got done, that's when it started acting up.If I had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device, I got tons of CRC errors and/or messages saying that I needed to format the card before using it. The phone would come up from time to time saying that I had inserted a blank card. If I reboot the phone, it works fine for a little bit, and the errors would start again. I thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted, so I tried to format it on the computer, but that didn't help anything.Very frustrating! Thankfully I've had it for 2 days before the trouble started, so it's going back to Amazon for a refund and I'll have to find a more reliable card for my phone."
1.0,The card worked great at first. I've never had a problem with Sandisk in the past but I bought this card for my Galaxy S3 back in October and it was dead by December. I'm sorely disappointed by this purchase. Maybe it's just a faulty card but my experience was terrible so this gets one star.
1.0,"never looked to verify the capacity of this card, it is clearly labeled 64gb but when installed it clearly is not. When installed into any computer it shows 27.4gb available with 1.68 used. So beware if you order one to make sure you are getting what you pay for."
1.0,"im so upset right now it just died , turned on my phone and all my movies pics music all gone. card just died after three months bullcrap."
1.0,"I have only had this for about 2 months and it is already dead. My GoPro doesnt see the memory card, my PC doesnt see the memory card, both of my laptops do not see it."
1.0,"I bought two of these from a major electronics retailer to make sure I don't get a bootleg one and they both crapped out on me. I usually buy from amazon but I needed them rig away . So unless that company has bought a large batch of bootleg cards or maybe I'm retarded. I bought them from the same store but different locations. I have switched brands now. Not taking anymore chances just in case a flood of bootleg ones hit the retail chains too. It worked fine at first but as the card filled up both times, both times they died and my pc or phone couldn't reformat it or recognize it. Good luck if you buy this major name brand, I thought they were the best too but not for me I guess."
1.0,"I bought this to store all my music on my phone, but it doesn't work. The phone has trouble reading from the card, and I keep having to reformat it. Buy one from Sony or some other company instead, especially if you have a GS3"
1.0,"Was working fine for 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Is not recognized by my computer or cell phone. I am beyond the Amazon return window, so this absolutely sucks.Wasted my money."
1.0,"I first tried putting it in my camera, without formatting.  It just said &#34;insert another card&#34;.  I put it into my linux computer, and it output lots of errors in the syslog, and fsck wouldn't work at all, just error'ed out, so I couldn't even format it.My windows computer couldn't recognize it either, though it tried to format it.  My phone didn't give any errors, but I wasn't able to really test it there.  (I do wonder if just the mini to standard adapter is the problem, since my phone has a mini slot, and everywhere else that I tried it needed the adapter...Exchanging for a different brand, and I'll see what happens."
1.0,I purchased four (4) items from amazon and when I opened the box my 32gb memory card was missing. So rating this product is truly impossible
1.0,"Everything transfered over to my new SD card fine, but now my phone will randomly lose the SD card and have to search and re-scan it. Tried another SD card and no problems. Now I can only get a refund since its out of stock.Updated 12/9/12-SD card will not not work. My phone or computer will not read it. Lost everything. I'd advise if you are looking to purchase an SD card look at another brand."
1.0,"After I put this card in my new S4, my camera would hang and just not respond to anything. Some apps also stopped working.  I put in my old 16GB card and everything worked fine."
1.0,"I thought buying this directly from amazon would guarantee me an ""authentic"" sandisk.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I got an ""authentic"" one or not, but it's failed within 6 months.  Either it's not authentic or sandisk has really dropped the ball on quality.  P.s. it's made in CHINA - if that tells you anything."
1.0,"Sadly I missed the return window by a couple of days.  this card got flaky in my galaxy note 2, a little google research and it appears this is a very well known and widespread issue with these class 10 32gb cards.  Avoid until it's fixed."
1.0,"Despite the Class 10 rating, this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition. If you're using that camera, choose one of the cards recommended on their site."
1.0,"This died so fast and I barely used it.  in fact, I did not even put anything on it and it died.  My pad recognized it for a few weeks, but when I went to put stuff on it, it was dead.Complete garbage, stay away."
1.0,"I was using mine in a GoPro Hero 3.  The card just broke for no reason.  There is controversy weather its the GoPro or SanDisk, but after doing some Google research it seems that its more of SanDisk's fault as these SD cards also fail (or used to) in varies Samsung devices (phones / tablets).  Amazon sent me a replacement, so no harm done, but for the money you would expect something top notch.GoPro users (on the support forums) recommend getting 2x32GB SD cards, which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows.  The worst part is losing important content, I was lucky, I copied my movies from the SD card onto a HD on my PC.  Others not so lucky."
1.0,"I purchased this for my gopro hero 3 and it worked ok for a while, then suddenly the camera would only record about 10 seconds at a time.  After reading some forums online, I was prompted to swap this Sandisk out for a Samsung card.  All of my problems went away!  I still use this card for random storage, but I won't use it in a camera again."
1.0,It Failed. It only worked 3 months.I used it in a Galaxy S3 phone. It seems that this brand has an issue with this model.I lost the information.
1.0,"I have lately purchased two micro-SD card one Sandisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC and 1 Sandisk Extreme Pro microSDHC 16GB. The first one claim 30MB/s the second claims 90-95MB/s. I 5 tests on my Galaxy Note 2 and 3 different benchmark test on my computer using USB 3.0 card reader. I can only get 7-8MB/s (this not even class 10, let alone UHS-1). I even did real world testing by copy a large set of data (2GB of photo).The result is no different. I do own Sandisk extreme SDHC card on my T3i and I do get 65MB/s of transfer rate. I strongly recommend consumers to test their premium (UHS-1) microSD. I felt very disappointed on Sandisk. I will try other brand like Samsung, Patriot or Lexar."
1.0,This doesn't work on the galaxy note 10.1. It is getting detected however it is not being utilized by the note 10.1.
1.0,"Card has failed several times in the phone I installed it in. I purchased it for the phone where it has resided for a month. In that time, it has required reformatting three times which makes its utility useless as a storage device."
1.0,"This card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors. I used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times I formatted, it would only record for about a minute before failing again. I picked up a PNY card since and it has worked beautifully. Unfortunately, I've been swamped and forgot to return this card before my 30 days. Not happy about that!"
1.0,"I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating ""media scanning"" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don't believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It's a dud. So disappointing."
1.0,"trash quality, broke and corrupted my data on two different cards"
1.0,"This card continually unmounted in my S4. It was really painful, when I remounted the card I sometimes retrieved my files, sometimes not. I have to say, though, that a card test in my PC, using Crucial diagnostics, went fine. My gut feel is that the card overheats, and shuts down in the S4, although I have no proof of this. What I do know is that it didn't work for me, and many others (google it). Naturally, Amazon refunded me the purchase cost when I returned the card, gotta love Amazon.I now have a Samsung 64g card, and no problems so far. I like Sandisk, but there's a compatibility problem here with the S4."
1.0,"I was taking a tour in Hangzhou China and while I was shooting with my Canon 6D, the card out of sudden crashed. My camera won't recognize the card and it showed ""card reading error"". I had more than 2000 photos in it including the trip in Beijing and Xi'an. I was not able to cover those photos even with the common flash memory recovery softwares. I may have to send it to Sandisk subdivision LC Technologies to recover those photos, for the 64 gb they are asking for $325, regardless how much photos they can recover.Lesson learned: for important shoots, use 32 SDHC card, they are so far the most stable SD cards out there. I spent over $10K for this vacation and most of these valuable memories are gone. Thanks a lot Sandisk! I wish I could give negative stars if Amazon allowed me to."
1.0,Unmounts randomly in mu surface pro 2.  Seems to mostly be centered around write operations.  Trying the samsung version which is sadly much more money.
1.0,"I have purchased two of these 64gb sd cards and used them in an Android phone, and in a video recorder.After about 3 months usage in my phone, the card would randomly unmount and it took many remounts or reboots to get the card to work again.  Eventually, it stopped accepting writes at all, and couldn't even be formatted... although I could see what was on there.I repurchased the card, and after a couple months, the same thing happened again: random unmounts.  I moved the card to a video recorder, where it worked for a while... but even with a different usage pattern, it died again.I have had no problems with 32GB cards so far.  I'm staying away from this generation of 64GB cards.----EDIT----Getting these cards RMA'd was quick and easy.  I had a Lexar 128GB SD card die too, and I sent the cards in all at the same time.  I haven't gotten an update from Lexar, but I got updates AND my replacement from SanDisk.  Supposedly there was something fixed in this new card revision.  I hope so."
1.0,"My Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD works fine with a 16GB SanDisk card, but the 32GB card died in less than 3 months.  SanDisk will replace the card under warranty, but the SanDisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month.  For two months, the card worked flawlessly, and then it started to have intermittent errors.  I thought it might be a problem with my phone, so I tried a 16GB card, and I never had a problem. When I returned to the 32GB card, the intermittent problems returned and got worse.  Eventually the card completely died, and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computer-connected card reader.  Both Windows 7 and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when it's well seated.I plan to update this when I have used my warranty-replacement card for three months, but that will be at least four months from now."
1.0,Bought it for my LG L9 Android phone and in the phone it stayed.  Speed is average.  The problem is that it broke within 8 months with all my data in there.
1.0,"I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad. I have had more than half of my sandisk 32gb cards, fail on me, in less than 6 months. I only buy them, because of the cards available in my area, these are the best, which is scary, with such a high failure rate."
1.0,"UPDATE:This card stopped working as of late February 2013, after only about 2 months of regular use.  There are 492 similar complaints about this card (now 493...) and this is 17.5% of 1 star out of 2918 reviews...  At first I thought it was my phone not being able to find it, or the card would often spontaneously dismount, and there were the frequent and repeated alerts for me to format the card.  Formatting the card only cured the problem for a day or two...  Plugged it into the desktop directly, and the same thing happened.  Got another card of another brand, and everything has been working well since early March 2013 with the other card. So it was not the phone but the card that is at fault.  Very poor longevity. The price is right, but at the end not worth it if you need to buy another card to replace it.  Amazon only covers 30 days..., so consider this a very expensive 60 day experiment if you are willing to try this brand of card...  Would NOT recommend."
1.0,"Used this micro sd card in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Was watching a video stored on the card while ago when the video quit playing, and the message &#34;Sorry, this file cannot be played&#34; appeared on the screen.  Checked ES File Explorer and found that all the apps, movies, music, etc. I had stored on the micro sd card were gone.  The card was apparently totally blank.  Inserted the card in my desktop computer, and the computer said that the card had to be reformatted before it could be used.  Tried to reformat it to NTFS, ex-fat, and fat32. Each time the computer said it was unable to complete operation.  Guess this card is dead after a little over 4 months...."
1.0,"It worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S3, and then failed after 3 months.  Have tried contacting Samsung via their warranty form on their website and I am not having any luck.  I gave up and bought a different 32GB card from NewEgg.com hopefully that one lasts longer."
1.0,"This card had rave reviews, so I decided to get it to use it with my new GoPro Hero3 camera.  I liked that it had a high capacity and it was class 10 which would allow me to maximize the features of my camera.  As soon as it arrived I popped it in to the camera for a quick test run and after it was successful I then packed it in my luggage for a snorkeling trip.  3 days into taking awesome footage with my camera this SD card started resulting in SD card errors which made my data unrecoverable.  Fortunately I still had some time in my trip to go get a different memory card with better reliability. These memory cards appear to be hit or miss, and in my case it was a miss.  I can not recommend this card for purchase.  It appears that this company has a problem with the Quality Control process, and you can see that reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or as is my case, 1 star/negative.  It looks as though they just accept a certain amount of faulty memory cards.  Unfortunately for me, I missed the window to return this card because I was travelling, and I am stuck with a useless micro SD card.  I've had better luck with Kingston, and Transcend brands. Lexar and Samsung have also served me well in the past.  I will no longer purchase any other SanDisk products and I wouldn't recommend that you would either, but if your are swayed by the reviews, make sure you thoroughly test what you purchase before you actually need it."
1.0,"We ordered these and used them in my Galaxy Note 2 and my wife's Razr M. After a few months we noticed that they would cause the phone to freeze up. The phones would start showing that it was mounting and unmounting the SD card early on but toward the end they just froze up the phone. Once we trashed the cards, the phones worked fine. We bought a different brand and no trouble since. I don't know why these red & gray ones have issues but stay away from them."
1.0,"Bought it, installed it in my Droid RazrM never removed it and it died at a little over 6 months now. Did not store apps or anything. just pictures and video from the phone."
1.0,"If you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. I bought this card in November of 2012 and it worked great for a while. The card started failing in my Galaxy Note 2 in the beginning of January. After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. If you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. I am glad I used dropbox for my phone so I did not lose any pictures or videos."
1.0,"I bought this and after a month of use on my Samsung Galaxy s2 it failed and could no longer be seen, and when i contacted support they said that i had to send it to them to get replaced which is more expensive than buying a new one"
1.0,"Got this for my Samsung 3.  After 4 months, was no longer accessible - first message I got on the phone was that there was an unformatted Sd card installed.  Next, it wouldn't even recognize the card was in there.  I inserted a different card, and the phone was able to recognize it and play music off it - - so, not the phone.  I also tried having my desktop read the card - - no go there either...."
1.0,"It worked for a while, I purchased 4 of them, then they just started dying.....one by one, none no longer work."
1.0,"I got this card only a few months ago, used it on a Note 3, now it has failed. No matter what I try, attempts to format the drive or edit the files on it, whether using my computer or the phone, have all failed. The card's data is now essentially read-only, which is the only saving grace of this since I could at least save my data.Previous to this I had an issue with it corrupting photos randomly, with increasing regularity as it grew closer to complete failure. I am now going to be avoiding SanDisk when possible"
1.0,"I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on 'mount sd card' it said it didn't understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It's extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don't understand why it's that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn't know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster..."
1.0,I had it for a day before it died and lost all my data. Not what I expected from SanDisk or any microSD card in this case.
1.0,"The card only read as 27 GB not 64 GB. I have formatted in various formats with various tools, and operating systems. I ordered a replacement and concluded this was a dud. Good luck buying this product, rest assured amazon has a good return policy."
1.0,Either it is the wrong chip or a false reading by the device because the data displayed consistently is &#34;insert ..&#34;
1.0,I can't read or write anything on this card on my PC or my GS3. I am pretty sure that I got a dud.
1.0,The docs for my Smart Phone said that this card would work in it.  After talking to SanDisk support I was told that a 32GB card was the max for my phone.  So I returned this card for a 32GB.  This card is probably a very good product.  Just the documentation for my phone was bad.
1.0,"Ordered two of these and none works w my Cell Phone, Audio player or Camera.Guys, you have a problem......................................................................................"
1.0,"Bought this with my Samsung Galaxy S4 when it first came onto market and it worked for about a week then quit. All of the pictures I had taken originally and stored on this card are just gone, it was a bad purchase and after looking through numerous forums, hundreds or thousands of people were having the same issues with this card and the Galaxy S3 + 4, I do not recommend buying this card if you'll be putting it in a galaxy. I'd like to tell sandisk where they can put it."
1.0,Unable to read.It says it's blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format.
1.0,The only reason I give one star is that I cant give zero stars.Just lost all my files in the SD in my S3. I cant believe I trust my valuable information in this company. AVOID THIS ITEM. Dont recommend it.
1.0,I've had two of these cards so far. Neither of them were recognized by Mac or PC. I am able to use it but only if I leave it in the Gopro camera and hook up the Gopro to the Mac via USB. It will not work as a normal SD card and needs to be used with the camera. I can not recomend this card at all. I had the first card replaced because it was defective. Now the second card is defective also. I don't have the time to play around with another return so I will just not ever buy Sandisk again.
1.0,"Maybe I got a defective card but this one felt a bit &#34;thinner&#34; and &#34;flimsier&#34; than other micro-SD cards I've had.The real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet, I started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card, then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt, and while a PC would recognize it, eery time I tried to format the card, there would be an error."
1.0,"I am hoping that I received a defective product and that my experience is rare, but this product did not work as intended. I was replacing another 32G micro sd card thinking that, because this is a Class 10 rated product, it would be faster. It never worked correctly. It kept dismounting unexpectedly, losing data, and was just not worth the money AT ALL! I ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day I bought it. I only wish this product had done the same."
1.0,"I purhcased this card for my Hero 3 cam.  It worked all of last year, or the 3-4 times i used it.  I used it again this year and had some great once in a  life time ski videos and the card failed.  It could not be read or reformatted.  I lost all my vids.  It was strictly used in my hero 3 cam.  I pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several PC's, multiple card readers, and recovery software but no good. I have never known a card to fail and I am extremely disappointed.Try another brand.  Next time I will use multiple cards with smaller storage and a different brand."
1.0,"I bought two of the 32 GB Sandisk Ultra microSDHC cards, and both of them were unusable.The first one stopped accepting new data when I had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card.  I couldn't add more files, and I couldn't reformat the card. If I tried to write a new file onto the card, the write operation seemed as if it worked, but the new data couldn't be read back successfully.  The files already on the card were still readable, though, so basically, the card had become a 1 GB ROM.  Fortunately, there was no sensitive personal information on the card, so I returned it to Amazon.The second one didn't fail the same way, but it was still unusable.  If I transferred a bunch of files and then read them back, most of the transferred files had data errors.  For example, a 3 minute music file might only be able to have it's first minute of music played back, then the bad data would stop the music player.  I ran a write/readback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested.  (I used Flash_Drive_Tester_v114.exe, which is a free download.)I ended up buying the equivalent Transcend productTranscend Information TS32GUSDC10 32GB micro SDHC10 Flash Memory - No Box or Adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly.  I have over half of the capacity in use, and I've never seen any sign of data loss or corruption.  For USB plug in flash drives, I've had good luck with SanDisk products, but my experience with the SanDisk microSDHC cards has been terrible."
1.0,"I can say that SanDisk is one of the best company in the fields of electronics and Digital Cameras, but I am very dissapointed of this Memory Card.The card memory is only 25GB and the speed is 14MB/s which is not as advertised.I gave it to my dad to use it on his phone and I started to use the Sony 32GB MicroSD. I can say that it works perfectly: the storage is 32GB and the speed is 43MB/s.Buy it now: http://amzn.to/1iGqMVm . This is the exact link I used to buy mine."
1.0,"spoke with customer service had it replaced 3 times, card had problems all of the times, they were all the time looking for ways to get out of the warranty until they decided i did something which obviously wasn't the problem because it happened 3 times with the previous cards, basically look into other companies that honer their warranties,very sad usually very good cards,they kept saying that Samsung updated the software and they update it in ways that it wont match the Sandisk cards.??"
1.0,"Pro:  &#9642;PriceCons:  &#9642;intially began to get card read errors on Samsung Note.  Right at 6 months it fails, lossing all my data.  Pictures, videos, documents, ect...  all gone.I shouldn't have cheaped out, I should have bought the samsung card."
1.0,"Purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage.  The one I received was DOA.  Spoke with SanDisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit.  Since it was within 30 days, they suggested I return it to Amazon instead of going through warranty procedures.  I returned it to Amazon, but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund.  The replacement appeared to work at first, but after a short while, it caused my phone to reboot, files went missing and displayed other forms of instability.  It was a bit late to return again, so I contacted Sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty.  However, this all took a lot of time, necessitated repeated copying of many GBs of data and secure erasing of information.The warranty replacement from SanDisk works well, so far.  However, I'm not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar 32GB Class 4 SanDisk microSDHC (this one is class 10).  Would probably give the current unit 3 stars, but this rating is for the Amazon delivered units (both defective).If you do get a bad one, I'd suggest to return for refund, not replacement."
1.0,"It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I'm still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon's return policy was quick and painless."
1.0,"Just as with many other reviewers here, my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half, and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted, while at the same time overheating dangerously. Sandisk is currently issuing an RMA to replace it, but I am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective. As is evident from the 1-star reviews here, the rate of such defects for these cards is about 10%, which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer. And it's not like Sandisk hasn't had a heads-up on this problem -- the negative reviews have been there for quite a while. Clean up your act, SanDisk!"
1.0,"I dunno if it's a bad copy or what but When I try to transfer files like 2GB or 3GB it doesn't copy! It ejects itself and then mounts itself again. I had to transfer all my songs from my PC through Airdroid which was a pain in the a$$ I can't transfer movies from my PC and by the way I tried formatting it and checking for some errors but same issue but I can move smaller files like 20MB or soVery disappointing especially for such price!UPDATE: Now I have more problems! My phone tells me every now and then that the ""SD card was unexpectedly removed"" and I tried on other phones with the same problem"
1.0,THIS CARD DIED IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH IN MY SIII LOST 400 PICTURES VALUABLE PICTURES AND INFORMATION DO NOT BUY.
1.0,"Pros: Looks good, works fine until it starts acting up.Cons : Worked for 6-8 months in 2 Samsung S3 phones, and 3 months in a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. One by one they all died, became unreadable. Cannot format either. Just dead. Wasted.Sandisk did not post any disclaimers like don't bother to use this in a Samsung device."
1.0,"rec and was happy.  good price, but we get want we pay for. the scan dic. would no por matt"
1.0,item i ordered was 64gb it listed it on the card but this was tested and at most was 1gb and very oldi would steer far away from sandisk sold online unless it is in original packagingI returned it for a full refund and reordered and oem 64gb card from samsung
1.0,"I had bought the 32GB card here on sale.  It ran great for the first 4 months.  This afternoon it unmounted from my Samsung SGS III.  I powered the phone down, re-seated the card, powered up and it was still not recognized. Powered back down, pulled the card and popped it into the computer and it showed a single partition of 0 bytes. Mounted the card back into the phone and booted into recovery (my phone is rooted with CWM), where I double checked that it could not be mounted or formatted. I then tried to re-partition the card but no luck. Phone is back up and running fine on a spare 8GB card so no problems there.  It doesn't matter how good or how fast the card is if it dies this quickly. I had most of my stuff backed up so no major loss, but I am out the cost of the card..."
1.0,The SD to microSD card adapter that comes with this product is too small. It is impossible to remove the card from the adapter without damaging it.
1.0,"Thank God for amazon return policy or I would be incensed.  This little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days.  I lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone.  I lost the music but have most on PC.  I lost the videos I had from concerts.What happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device (Sandisk Ultra) could not be found.  I took it out and restarted my Galaxy Note 2 and it worked.  then about one hour later I got the same warning.  I tried to save my data with MY Backup Pro App (I had to purchase an extra 3 GBs of data for cloud because the App comes with only 75 MB or something like that and so I backed up everything on the Sandisk Storage).  And as it was backing everything on line  using the Backup Pro Cloud, the Sandisk fried and stopped the backup process.  I was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime I performed this process, the phone would not complete the format.  Now keep in mind that I was not near a computer because I was on vacation so I could not use a computer to format in Fat32.I am returning this disc and purchasing a Samsung 32 GB that costs over 50 bucks.  You get what you pay for."
1.0,"I put this NEW sd card in my NEW GS4 for the first time, and now the metal contacts are scratched and it randomly unmounts from the phone!  My older 32GB SanDisk works just fine, so I'm thinking its the thicker paint or something causing this...  I don't know, but its ruined!  It scratched the first day, but I'm just now noticing the unmounts now that I have my music on it, every few songs it will unmount and remount, interupting my music...  I'll never buy another expensive SanDisk.  I'm going to order a different brand, just make sure I can find one without paint on it....  Sucks, I really thought this was going to be a good one!  I love the colors, and its so fast to transfer files to.... too bad its broken.  And I didn't find out about it until after the return date, so i'm screwed.  Oh well.  Never again, I'll give my business to someone else...."
1.0,"Got this to use with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition. Put it in, seemed to work. tried to get the data from the card after using it for a second and the card says it needs to be formatted.Looked to gopro's website and it is NOT on their recommended card list. Reason being is that the card isn't fast enough. It's a class ten yes but clearly not fast enough.Definitely get the recommended card, IF it does work at first it will probably die in a couple of days."
1.0,"I will be brief and simple.Errors, errors, errors!What happened to SanDisk?  You need to check your QC unit!Awful product ever from a reputable memory company.Update: I got thisSamsung 32GB 32G Class 10 MicroSD C10 MicroSDHC Flash Memory Card Model MB-MSBGA/KRto replace the sandisk garbage. Replacement works as it should. Same on you SanDisk, you lost one of your long time customer."
1.0,"I installed this on my Galaxy Note 2 and it crashed after one month. Lost all my pictures on the card. Had it not been for Google Plus instant upload and redundant backup to Dropbox all of the pictures would have been lost. I think I should get a refund but I did not keep the original packaging. I would not buy this, but if you do keep the packaging so you can return it. If you read most of the reviews you will see that a lot of people have had trouble with this card crashing. I don't think Amazon should offer it as it hurts their overall customer satisfaction."
1.0,"My wife's Razr M has been a great phone to date. I matched it with what I thought would be a great memory card, having been a long time Sandisk Ultra user in my photography.Sadly after 3 months, without warning, the card mysteriously ""bricked"". Unreadable by her phone, two PCs and one Mac .. the only thing that can even SEE the card is my Droid Bionic - which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted. I am hesitant in the very odd chance I can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our 6 month old baby which were not backed up.I could not be any more disappointed in this product."
1.0,"I bought this on black friday last year and took a chance on it. What chance u say? I read some reviews that this card just actually STOPPED working for no reason and not due to abuse or misuse. I had this card in my Acer Iconia A500 and it just STOPPED WORKING! Even my computer doesnt recognize it. WTF Sandisk?? This is an expensive part for this to occur. DO NOT BUY OR IF U DO, BE CAREFUL WHAT U STORE ON IT! I only had music and movies on mine so NBD. But what if u had this in your phone with valuable pictures?"
1.0,1080p 30fps or 720p 30fps or 24fps using the nokia camera app or regular app doesn't work. well it does but unless you want to see stuttering every 6-7 seconds. it freezes up constantly. very glitchy because its slow. got a 9mbs write 44.9mbs read on mine.
1.0,"failed in my galaxy note after 8 months.lost all my pictures and videos that werent backed up.the card worked fine until suddenly wasnt being recognized on the phone or the computer.Sandisk honored the warrenty and sent a replacement and it works, but I am less confident about the product and afraid to lose data on it in later when i'm not prepared."
1.0,"Stick with the 32GB model. First one got SMOKING hot about 1 minute after use, but it seemed to function. Then I installed it in my Samsung Galaxy Note II and it got hot in the phone. After a day it just quite all together, luckily I still had my 32GB and a backup of my data. Did an RMA and got a new one, which didn't get hot but died after less than a month of use. I'll wait until Lexar's 64GB comes down in price a bit and then try that one...but not this SanDisk one! Their 32GB seem to be ok though."
1.0,"Got it on sale for an incredible price.  The only way I am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a 128g size.  64g is not necessary for my use, but at 128 I would be able to use it without worry of running out of space /and/ put my entire mp3 catalog on it as well.Update - about 4 months after I bought this and installed it in my Galaxy S2, it started causing some trouble for my phone.  At first I did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem, but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like ""Unmount the SD card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data"", and eventually it didn't even recognize that there was a card in there at all.  I put the old 1gb card back in and it works fine.  Put the 32gb card into the adapter, and put it into the computer's card reader... Nothing.  Wouldn't read it at all.I do back up my phone occasionally, maybe once a month, but lost everything; every photo and video I had taken of my new kitten since I got her because of this.  It is very surprising since Sandisk is usually quite reliable.  My wife has the same card in her phone, we got them around the same time, and hers is still working normally so far.YMMV, but always back up your data regularly (more than once a month) if you are taking a lot of pictures and video."
1.0,"Most of my reviews are positive.  This product failed (could not read on my device (a Galaxy S3) nor on my computer with 2 different readers) in less than 30 days.  The customer support is also unhelpful, as they would only replace the card after many questions, they would not provide a refund (I did not want a replacement of a card that failed so quickly).I would suggest buying a different card, it is not worth the hassle and lost data to save a couple of dollars with buying this one."
1.0,"This ""Ultra High Speed"" card is about half the speed of the Class 4 card I was using.  10MB/s Read and 6MB/s write is more than a little below where a device with this rating should perform.  I could believe if it was the same speed as my old card, maybe my brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 doesn't have a UHS1 rated port, but to be half the speed of my Class 4 card, this ""UHS1"" thing clearly is penciled on by marketing monkeys and sold without any testing or quality control. I wish I knew how to rate with 0 stars."
1.0,"The description is quite confusing - it says at same time class 10, which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mb/sec, and at the same time, it says UHS-1, which means 30mb/sec write speed. The truth, as usually, is somewhere in the middle, but close to lower end. I have a dedicated, high speed PCI-E cardreader, which I use for chip benchmarking. So, this card showed 12mb/sec sequental write speed and 34mb/sec sequental read speed. So, UHS-1 is ""true"" only for read operations, meaning that if you wanted this card to speed-up your digital camera speed photography - you've made the wrong choice. Just for reference, this cardTranscend 16 GB Class 10 microSDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GUSDHC10has sequental write speed of 17mb/sec and sequental read speed of 24mb/sec. As you see, the cheaper transcend has average 40% faster write speeds!"
1.0,"I am going to start spending a little more money if needed and start buying Transcend. The one Transcend thumb drive I've purchased, 64G, works great and always has. The SanDisk 64G thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working. Everything I've been told to do to reformat and reset it doesn't help. And FYI, I ALWAYS ejected the drive before I disconnected it. These memory cards from SanDisk that I've bought also have these little headaches all the time. All my Transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my 40G worth of music to. Spend the little extra money if need be and buy the Transcend."
1.0,I bought the Sandisk Ultra 32gb card for use in my Samsung smart phone.  Worked great for about 3 months.  Now the phone won't recognize the card & neither will my computer.  Just went unreadable one day.  Very disappointed in the reliability of this card.  Will contact Sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty.  Shall see if they'll stand behind their product.
1.0,"I thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews.  But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product.  My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems.  I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times.  So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.""You get what you pay for"" may be applicable here.  But a lot of others did have success with this card.  So YMMV."
1.0,I used it in my Droid Razr Maxx HD and it kept unmounting itself.  Then it became unresponsive and all my data was lost.  Now it isn't recognized by my phone or my laptop.  Dead in the water.
1.0,"This review is for the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) that was purchased for me from Amazon.FRUSTRATING in a word. This card was reported by two different Android phones as damaged but my Windows computer recognized it with no issues. If the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data, music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged. I had this card returned to Amazon after 3 days of sheer frustration.I read another review that suggested the Class 10 cards were not ideal for smart phones. I was already using a Sandisk Class 4 16GB card in another phone and had never had issues so I purchased a Class 4 Sandisk 32GB and it was as smooth as butter. Both phones recognized the card right away and added data, music and pictures seamlessly and quickly. The second card purchased was the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card, Black, SDSDQM-032G-B35 (Retail Packaging).In summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers (here on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet) that had similar issues with smartphones I cannot recommend this card for a smartphone."
1.0,"I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just ""a dud"", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead."
1.0,It failed after about one year of using on a samsung Galaxy s4. Now I contacted Sandisk for a potential replacement. I can't format it or do anythin wiith it.
1.0,I returned to order a 11.6 laptop so I could have full operations than having a Notebook. I am sure this is good quality as I have purchased San Disk numerous times.
1.0,"Fortunately I got this as a lightning deal, so it wasn't that expensive.  I purchased it in October, but didn't start using it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 until January.  It was fine, until it wasn't.  It chose to die today.  Just a little more than four months after I started using it.  I checked my phone this morning and it told me that the SD card had been unmounted.  I did not think much of it.  But when I rebooted my phone and was still unable to find the card, I began to be concerned.  When I got home from work, I put a different card in, and it worked fine.  I tried to check the card on my computer, and it couldn't be seen.  So the problem is definitely a card.  Unfortunately, I lost most of the pictures I've taken since getting this phone.  I know that I probably should have backed them up, but I really didn't expect the card to fail so quickly.  Perhaps if I'd read all of the one start posts before buying, I would have.  Oh well, back to my 16GB Amazon Class 10 card until I can get a different one.I'm not even going to bother with a warranty claim.  I don't need another card that will fail after four months."
1.0,"Got the SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A on December 28, 2012, died on May 20, 2013Could not write to it or change any data, no matter what device i used. Even after format (Full & Quick using disk manager & EaseUS Partition Master 9.1.1 Home Edition, connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor) when disconnected and reconnected no change. Dropbox saved my data luckily (Had it syncing using Dropsync Pro).Was using it with Samsung Galaxy Note 2 T889 for the whole time, never was removed."
1.0,"I haven't figured out yet if I'm a dummy or if I have a defective card.  I don't know if the card is bad since I can't even get the card to stay in my Samsung Galaxy S4.8.  The little card will go in (the larger one won't) but it won't stay in.  If I put pressure on it the Samsung says .. preparing SD card but as soon as I release pressure the Samsung says .... card removed.This card came from a source outside of Amazon and took way to long to get here.  It arrived in a white envelope with NO instructions.  I'm very upset about this purchase as I've never had a problem before with either SanDisk or Amazon.  I'll try to find someone with more experience than me to give this a try before I return it.  I would have expected this to come in a package from SanDisk, like other SanDisk products I've bought in big box stores or from Amazon but it did not."
1.0,06.NOV.2012 - Bought the card.12.JAN.2014 - Card failed.It cannot be formatted or used in any way.It lasted 14 months and most of that time I was not even using it.
1.0,"NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless.. """
1.0,"The 64GB card I purchased actually contains 4GB of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64GB drive in various drives and readers. Of course, this took me a while to figure out since I only just got around to copying more than 4GB of data to the card, but with some testing I have nonetheless discovered this to be the case.The card I bought was in Amazon Frustration Free packaging. I don't know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions, but I suspect that I will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on."
1.0,"I have purchased 2 of these cards.  I have attempted to use them in my GoPro HeroHD, Samsung Galaxy S4, Asus TF700, and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning.  I then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files.  I will never buy these Ultra models again."
1.0,"I'm so disappointed in SanDisk. I bought this for my Galaxy S3 phone. Worked great for the first few months. Suddenly I noticed some pictures were missing. Then it kept giving me an error that the 'SD card has unexpectedly stopped working' then i tried popping out the card and popping it back in. Now it says unrecognizable files and it asks to format the mp3's I had bought and stored on the microsd card. In a pinch just to see if this would fix my issues I formatted the disc. Now I lost everything and it is still giving me issues. Read some similar issues from other customers, now I'm regretting my purchase. Save your money and headaches and buy something else!"
1.0,"April 2013.  I have had the card for about 4 months and seemed to work fine.  I use it to store additional files on my ultrabook as the solid state drive is small (only 128GB).  About a month ago, the card could not be recognized.  It only lasted about 2 hours, so I thought maybe just a momentary blip.  However, this weekened, it cannot be recognized at all and it has been 3 days.  Sandisk support is not available until the week, so I will update on tech support soon.  However, I did find that the SanDisk indicated there was a defect with some of these cards.  I assume they will replace it, but I have lost lots of hours and a lot of pictures... so I am really bummed and frustrated.From SanDisk: ""SanDisk has been made aware of potential product issues involving a very small percentage of its 32GB and 64GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra microSD cards. Under certain circumstances the cards may lock up and the card becomes inaccessible. The issue has been identified and a manufacturing fix has already been put in place. SanDisk stands behind its products and any customer who experiences this issue with the microSD cards cards is asked to contact the SanDisk support center for a resolution immediately."" SanDisk"
1.0,"I got this product exactly 1 month and 3 days ago. Prior to today, it was working fine. Out of nowhere, my Micro SD card can't be read anymore. I've tried several phones, and 3 different laptops (both OSX and Windows 7), and it doesn't even show up anymore. Be weary of the product. You may end up with a lemon."
1.0,Performance and capacity were not in line with cost and expectations. These are most likely counterfeit or back door sales in my opinion. Very unsatisfied.
1.0,"I had this Sandisk 32Gb Class 10 micro SDHC card in a Pittasoft Blackvue DR500GW-HD in-car camera DVR. It worked like a champ for 2 months and then died with the dreaded ""Please format the SD card"" errors. Stuck it in my Mac Mini (2011) and it is unrecognizable. Same with Windows PC. Even the low level HP SD card formatter cannot reformat it. So in the garbage it goes. I have 2 more of these cards in my Garmin GPS devices and they continue to work (so far) but they are not being written to continually every day like the Blackvue. So a word of advice; if you need to write to these cards often - buy something else."
1.0,Failed after a year!
1.0,"I purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4. This card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in. The unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours, days! I tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result. I attempted to contact Sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty. They know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came. I called back and was told that they would re-email it to me. To this day I am still waiting for that email. I have never had this issue with this company but with  ever changing technology, it is what it is, right? I know this card will be good for some device I have. If you own a galaxy phone beware!! I have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that I cannot review."
1.0,"When i got this memory card, noticed the writr protect lever was hard to move. Instead of just sending it back I tried to meve it and the mdmory card broke on hslt.I hanve many SNdisk cards and havd had no troible with them. I guess I just got one that missed wuslity conttol on the line.Dont want to buy another but what do you do."
1.0,"I bought this on October 9th and didn't start using it for about a week after I received it on the 11th. Well two days ago it died a quick death, I can't even format it! So after all these years of buying SanDisk products I guess I will give in and start paying a little more for Kingston it seems as though SanDisk is getting to be a cheaply built product. You would think that a product this small and inexpensive would be able to be replaced without cost within the first 90 days but that is my fault for not reading the fine print so lesson learned. Buy it right and buy it once so go with something else!"
1.0,"As the title says, the card I got is defective and faulty. The issue is, the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted, so first I tried to format it using my cellphone (xperia play) copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried 2 other phones (inspire 3g and Samsung Galaxy S4) still same error, then I tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format AND check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says &#34;cannot continue because sd card is corrupted&#34;.  I searched google and find out the Sandisk have shipped a bad Batch of Sd cards, so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon, got RMA'ed and already shipped it and I do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card. So now I do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that could've avoided if Sandisk's QA Department is not slacking off. Very disappointed customer."
1.0,"First of all I am not sure if the product i received is a CLASS 10 memory card. The reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my WINDOWS 8 system is 1.4 MB/Sec. Also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive 'Disk Cannot Be Formatted' error.I am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop, Do not recommend SANDISK please check other brands."
1.0,Stopped working after a year and a half and lost a bunch of data. I have tried accessing the data useing multiple devices with no luck. Look elsewhere for an Micro SD card
1.0,"Pros:1. ordered it and got free shipping.2. got it in 3 days.3. popped it out of the box.4. popped it in the cellphone!5. Done!Cons:1. doesn't come with a hot pocket.2. Amazon won't marry me.3. took me too long to order the hell was I thinking.4. took too long to get it out of the box 1 second!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------update:Okay  I have to bring this rating down to 1 star.... My 64gb SD card just crapped out. I'm getting the ""0x80071ac3"" code and i cant format it or copy files to it. I ran scan disk and nothing works... I don't know if i will be buying any more SD cards again from them. luckily i was able to save all my files. I've goggled this problem and this is a common problem with these cards..."
1.0,"I hope you have better luck, it has gotten a lot of great reviews, but first the sticker(!) covering the contacts on the back fell off, then the card died completely. Hopefully it's an isolated incident, but I'm trying a different brand in case its a bad batch."
1.0,"Worked fine for a month and then after about a month, the phone didn't see the card any more. Tried to read it on several PC's and none of them detected the card. Unfortunately it hadn't been backed up so all pictures and videos take on the phone are now gone."
1.0,"Bought this for Galaxy S3, worked like a charm for 3 months & then I started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there, went on like this for a week or so & then one day gone. Initially I thought it was problem with phone. Popped in a 2Gb card from BB & it worked. Popped this one into the BB & same, no detection. After spending so much on an SD card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period."
1.0,Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I started having all kinds of issues with recording photos and movies to the card.  It would look like it worked and then when I'd go back to review the photos or movies they were corrupted.  I see other people having the same issue with these cards.  Lost memories - bad card...
1.0,"I have not had many problems with what I have bought over the years, but when I do I will make sure to warn others. I loaded a handful of videos from my PC and then installed this in my Android tablet for a trip. Corrupted. Nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen, other times it doesn't even show up. The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn't feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32gb micro SD card.I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a year. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying marks---- has worked for two years without a problem.I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those terms. If you're looking for a good card, search Amazon for this one: LSDMI32GBSBNAR. This is the Lexar and I have thousands of pictures, video clips, and it has even endured three updates to my phone--- plus I carry my phone everyday so it is subject to everyday life all the time, it has been tough stuff."
1.0,"Picked this up on sale.. doesn't work, only shows up as a 1MB (yes, Megabyte) card that I can'd do anything with.  I already threw away the original packaging too.  I'm sure returning it is going to be a huge PITA because of that.UPDATE: After writing this (albeit, short) review I found this is not uncommon.  I also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying ""The SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Card works with any microSDXC compatible device.""  That was all the motivation I needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced."
1.0,"Within an hour of using the memory card, it failed and died. it kept saying &#34;Memory error.&#34;I could never get my dashcam camera to record anything. I went to our walmart and got me just MicroSD not Ultra. It has been working all day so far.That's right. There is no way to tell what you are getting online is OEM or knock offs. When the price is too good to be true, it probably is - made and distributed by Mofia. LOL.Although the package arrived on time, I will never buy this product online or from this seller on Amazon. Waste of money."
1.0,"Beware guys. i bought one of these from Superior Electronics Outlet and it arrived completly dead. i tried to format it on windows and on my galaxy s3 and no go.I tried everything that possible ....have been fighting with this card for 3 days now, and no success so far. No response from the seller about it.My last hope is amazon refund me. otherwise  i just wasted 80 U$"
1.0,"I bought the SanDisk 32 Gb micro SD card (class 10) in Dec for a new Galaxy S3. I used it for songs and video and pics. It started acting flaky in April and would unmount itself and then remount and I had problems with playing music. Then it completely died and would not even reformat. This is a known issue, and I will write back after I try to get SanDisk to replace it."
1.0,"Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card. To everyone else--unsafe at any speed."
1.0,This may be the worst memory card I've ever purchased - and I have bought a lot of card over the years - wish I had just stuck with my ADATA cardsFirst issue - I lost a bunch of photos - they just did not exist at all - it was as if I never took them  - but since there was a large gap in the file names I know for sure I didOf 200 photos taken about 40 in the middle just disappearedi could not even recover them using a deep scan toolI've been shooting digital since the mid 90s and this is the first time anything like this has ever happenedThen there is the cheesy SD adapter - the switch was so loose it switched to locked while I was taking pictures.Luckily the camera warned me that the card was read only - after having already taken a bunch of shots that has saved without issueFinally I figured I could just use these in my Samsung phones - no such luck - the second I put them in and took a photo I got an error that it could not right to the card and I could no longer see the 8gig of photos that were on itYes this may be a know issue with the cards - I see a review mentioned that - and I see that SanDisk will replace them - but they cannot replace the photos I lost - so keep that in mind when considering this card - I will
1.0,"As others have found, these cards do not last. Mine died in less than 2 months. Lost several photos that I had not backed up yet. The warranty replacement died within 3 months.Go with another brand. I've been using a Kingston and so far, 9 months later, still working."
1.0,"Started acting erratically after about a month, it's now been a little over a month and all my files are gone. Not all of them were able to be backed up. I hope I can get at least the pictures back. Glad the S4 backs up photos automatically..."
1.0,"Acquired this card a month ago for use in my phone Samsung Galaxy S4 and only have taken issues with it.The micro sd card is really bad, the camera takes a long time to be ready and repeatedly resets the phone. Absolutely not recommend it in my previous phone (S3) used a micro sd card 32GB Samsung brand and never had problems with it.To correct the problem of instability recommend formatting the card, I did and the problem remains the same.Live outside the U.S. and I must acquire excellent quality products because the cost of returning it exceeds the cost of the product.Next time buy a card SAMSUNG brand that never gave me problems."
1.0,"32 gb card is unredable...tablet cant read it, camera cant read it... Unable to format it... And  i dont havve 20 words...I have 30$ less..."
1.0,randomly died out of nowhere. i have the camera on for about 2 min and the card worked. turned the camera off and back on a few min later and the card no longer worked. I have no idea what happened but this seems to be a common problem with these cards.
1.0,"Purchased for my galaxie 3 phone and it fits and works. Not much else to say. ok, the price was good.Update 06/24/13It stopped working! All of a sudden my phone started alerting me that the sd chip was mounting and dismounting. Caused the battery to drain in a few hours. Everything on the card was lost. I attempted to re-format in my laptop. Card was not found by laptop.Googled the issue and found many blogs of others experiencing the same problem.I will attempt to return to Amazon."
1.0,"Died within 6 months! Stopped being able to read or write :( When I went to destroy it, it crumbled easily into tiny pieces. Never again."
1.0,Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues.

1.0,"Hello,Great card, great price. Plenty of speed and worked for...about a year. In fact, I wish it had stopped working a month earlier.It looks like Sandisk is out to make sure their cards stop working perfectly after the return window is up or something, because now on the end of December (Return window expired about 20 days ago) this thing only intermittently is recognized. It unmounts all the time in my phone and then gets remounted, and usually it doesn't even remount.While it was a good price, it was a good price for a name brand card that would have lasted longer than a year instead of Sandisk going &#34;ahaha got you good, now you have to buy another expensive name-brand card!&#34;Nope, I'll buy a cheaper alternative and it'll probably last longer. I still have some Kingston's going strong."
1.0,"DO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure.I guess the disk has some problem and I don't bother recovering it, since it's not going to be reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk's CF card in my camera for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.So it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don't put important data in it. Be prepard that it can fail at any time."
1.0,"I bought this Sandisk 16GB Class 10 to use with my HTC Inspire, after 3 months, I am getting constant error saying SD Card unmounted unexpectedly.Then today, the dang fkang card won't even read in the card reader, I have 10GB worth of videos and pictures, memories that I will never be able to get back. I am very upset."
