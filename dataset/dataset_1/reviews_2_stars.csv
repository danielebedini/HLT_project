2.0,"I used this for a few months in my phone, then it decided to quit mounting. I lost some pictures of pets who died shortly after. I got a replacement card, but I had to send in the old one, giving up any chance of recovering its contents. The new one's worked fine, but failing after 3 months in inexcusable."
2.0,"It works but the actual R/W speeds are 18/8 MB/s, not even Class 10. It should be marketed as ""Sandisk Basic"", not Sandisk Ultra"", unless they mean ultra slow. Now is 2014 and there is no excuse for such slow card from Sandisk.*** UPDATE ***I have redone the test with NotePro 12.2"" instead of using non UHS-I PC and the latest results are 32/8.6MB/s. Since the read speed hits 30, I believe the device is DHS-I ready. Still underwhelmed by the write speed though."
2.0,"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.  And critically important, it never dips under 10MB/s."
2.0,Used it in my Galaxy Note 2 for the past 16 months. All the sudden it is no longer writable. I tried many ways to reformat the card. Even Windows says format successful but all files remain after I remove and re-insert the card. Since I have private files in the card I'm not able to delete. I do not want to sent it back to SanDisk for replacement.
2.0,So this product is a large disappointment...bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted....I've reformatted the card a few times but it's to the point now that even a reformat doesn't work..  Wasted money...don't recommend purchasing.
2.0,"Thus microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed &#34;twice&#34;. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn't &#34;see&#34; that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don't plan to try formatting it again, I'll switch to a different brand of card."
2.0,"Hard to review this as the card arrived DOA. Couldn't write to it at all, and it wouldn't format. I returned it and Amazon was great about the credit. I've owned several SanDisk memory cards and they have all performed well and I was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box. I'd read a good review of the Samsung 64GB micro card and I bought that instead. Very pleased with it."
2.0,Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn't have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good
2.0,I loaded this memory card into my TF700T and could not get it to install. I found it to be a format issue and could not reformat it to get it to work. I sent it back and got the class 10 sandisc card ( non ultra ) and it loaded perfactly.
2.0,"The product is OK, but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of 10 MB/sec.  Most applications probably don't need to hit 10 MB/sec, but my GoPro Hero 3 does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes.  As tested, my card got between 8-10 MB/sec using the larger block sizes.  I complained to Sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which I did (and took almost 2 weeks), but the replacement behaved the same way.  I would say this card is OK for most applications, but if you need top end speed, I would go with another card.  I bought my card in May 2013 and had it replaced in August 2013 so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now."
2.0,"I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but the device seems pretty slow. I haven't seen any real performance boost vs. my old card even on bulk file copies. I have another 8GB samsung card that may be a knockoff that performs noticeably better than this card.I'm using it anyway. I don't really have the time to return it or anything."
2.0,I have nothing to use this device with. I ordered by mistake. I'm sure it's a great product but not for me.
2.0,I could not get this brand of memory card to work in my Roku.  It would not format correctly.  I had to return this for another brand which worked ok.
2.0,"I bought this to use as expanded storage in my Asus Transformer Book T100 but it was unstable and I have had to return it. Although the tablet would see the card when it was first inserted there would be errors trying to copy files onto it and then Windows would indicate that it needed formatting. If I tried a quick format then everything seemed to be OK but the instability would return as soon as I tried to copy data to the card. If I tried a full format it always failed.I gave it two starts because it seemed to work using the supplied SD adapter in a Windows 7 laptop. I was able to do a full format on that but, when I put it back into the tablet, the problems continued. The tablet is compatible with SDXC cards and, when I tried a different micro SD card in the tablet, it worked fine so I assume it was a problem with this card."
2.0,"this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them."
2.0,"I was given this card in October to add to my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry. In any event, I've upped my rating to two stars."
2.0,Tried this with its adapter on DSLR Camera and got some errors at times while trying to save data to card.  It is ok for other uses like computer external data.
2.0,"I was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter, and thought they were slower than they should be.  I just bought a full size Sandisk Ultra 16GB class 10 (all the same specs except size theoretically) for a different project, and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer! The write speed on this card is between 7 and 10 MB/s, the read seems to be 35MB/s, compared to the full size card with write speed of 22 to 25MB/s and a read speed of 42MB/s (this is from an imaging program, not a benchmark program, so it's not checking different sizes of transfer and the like).  Compare that with a Transcend 4 GB Class 4 card, the write speed is nearly identical (7 to 9MB/s), while the read speed on the class four is 12 to 13MB/s, significantly slower, as expected.The read speed is good, but the write speed is abysmal!  If it says ""Class 10"", it should be somewhat close to the Class 10 spec.I'm returning them."
2.0,"Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card's speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace...."
2.0,"Bought this card for my Galaxy S4 and after installing it and loading my music, the card was randomly ejecting itself. After like the 3rd ejection of the morning, the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged, so I reformatted. The random SDCard ejection and Damaged card kept coming up. After googling, I read that the Galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with SanDisk cards and its a hit or miss, some phones have no issues. I have replaced this card already, which Amazon, shipped me a 2nd card within a few days, but the same problems arise. Not sure if I should switch to a different brand, but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being. Maybe I can give it away to a friend who doesn't have an S4. :/"
2.0,"This is called &#34;Class 10&#34;, so I ordered it, figuring it would have useable speed. I plugged it in to copy about 9GB of program installation files. I was totally dumbfounded that it took about 3 hours to copy those files onto this &#34;Ultra&#34; &#34;Class 10&#34; SDXC card. (9GB on my super-slow, super-cheap plastic school-kid USB thumb drive takes less than 10 minutes.) So then I tested it on various known computers with typical raw and JPG picture files. Read speeds ranged from 15-25MB/s, while write speeds ranged from 4-8MB/sec for big files, and below 1MB/sec for small files. This is what I would call largely unusable. VERY disappointing."
2.0,"I was very excited to add this memory card to my G2 and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore. This was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data. I tried formatting it (never could wipe it), using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data), all to no avail. Luckily the data I had on it was still salvageable."
2.0,"It took 6 days for me to get 2 of these cards when I made the order early in the morning-normally that'll get my product to me the next evening. Not SIX DAYS LATER!Be warned, this was the slowest shipping I've had for my Paid Prime Account since I started. If you need these cards quickly, buy from a different seller."
2.0,"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing."
2.0,"With a USB 3.0 card reader, CrystalDiskMark shows blazing fast 47MB/s read but disappointingly slow 13MB/s write speed. So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable. This card is classified as ""class 10,"" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10MB/s without UHS. It fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well."
2.0,"Not ok with GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition. The speed of this card is below other brands' class 10 standard. When I use this card with GoPro and Pro-tune on, it will stop recording after 20 mins or so. I already returned this item and bought the Samsung class 10 memory card instead."
2.0,"The item arrive in time, but was unfortunately defective as it would not accept a copy operation. Further investigation led to discovering the card had bad sectors. Refund is progressing without a hitch however, so not all was lost."
2.0,First of all Amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card. It is different that what was listed on the page. There goes a star for incorrect shipping. And the item has stopped working after a week in my Surface tablet.
2.0,"this did not last very long. Would not work in any of my mobile devices. I tried it in 4 different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve. Not much use there, since i already have 2 TB"
2.0,"8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work."
2.0,This might be my 3rd 32 GB disk that I buy from scanDisk.They work for few months and then NOTHING...My tablet wont detect them anymore... my computer wouldn't either.Quite disappointing.
2.0,"I have to assume that the brand new 64gb SanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDXC card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter/pausing that has happened since I started using it today.  Prior to that, never had an issue with my previous SanDisk SDHC card.  But today on its maiden trip, it has led each video (only 3-5 minutes long each) to have several performance issues that by default I have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and I've never had an issue in the four months that I've had my Galaxy Note 2.  No problems formatting this card though or installing/using it otherwise."
2.0,"I have had the 32gb in my Galaxy S3 for almost three months and there were no issues. However, the phone just recently started telling me the card has unrecognized files or it is empty, causing the loss of my media. I chose to format it after seeing the error for too long, chalking it up to some random error. Somehow, yesterday, all of the files on my card magically reappeared and I was able to play my music again, despite having had the phone format the card. Shortly afterwards, the error reappeared. I put the card in my computer and it is simply not appearing. Shame, but I think this is a risky card to purchase."
2.0,"I just called Sandisk and they say they have a new card version that corrects the problem. 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)Sandisk Tech says that the new package will show that the card is made after March, 2013 (don't know if that includes March, but probably does), and it should be corrected. Some older than late 2012 reportedly are ok.  Who knows.They even say that they will provide a free UPS return label.Of course, you are taking a risk as to whether the problem is really fixed, so keep backups.  I don't know what I would do."
2.0,"I bought it for a Samsung s3 and had continuous problems of messages saying it wasn't connected, etc.  Replaced it wit the equivalent Trascend and never had a problem for the past several months.  It would work on a PC with ana adapater and then failed to format in any device so I had to RMA given the lifetime guarantee.  A hassle."
2.0,"Unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s2. I installed it and the phone would &#34;check&#34; it only to tell me &#34;SD card ready for removal&#34;. This was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to FAT32, NTFS, and FAT the card would not work and would revert back to exFAT format.I do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my 3-stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site."
2.0,"I bough it because it said it was fast, but not. I'm only getting 13Mb/s with an Galaxy Note II a very fast an excellent phone."
2.0,The class ten card failed and jamed my phone a KYOCERA RISE : it was replaced with another regular H D 32GB SanDisk card and is working fine. The micro SDHC CARDS are 1/3 less in price than they used to be and are a best buy by far.Your Music PalJoe Mal
2.0,"The cars seemed great, but occasionally the card is suddenly &#34;not formatted&#34;, even without writing new data to it. Has happened in multiple devices.I lost some video I can't rerecord on it, and am fairly upset.Some forums say that the early runs of these cards did that occasionally and that it has been fixed on new runs, but I find it difficult to trust them now. I have never had this problem with any SanDisk product before, including the 5 of these cards I have in 32GB.Very disappointed."
2.0,"I ordered this card as part of a lighning deal back in November. The card was working fine in my galaxy s3 until a few weeks ago where it would intermittently not be recognized by my phone or my desktop computer and today, 4 months later, it died completely. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
2.0,"In real-life use--copying compressed files to and from the card--it clocks in at barely over half the advertised speeds: about 16MB/s read and about 7.5MB/s write, as averaged between testing on several SD slots (some USB-connected, some PCIe-connected) on several computers, plus a just-released smartphone. Very unimpressed by the &#34;up to&#34; marketing of SD card vendors and makers.The actual raw size is also about 59.5GB, which I find fascinating for a flash device, which is only ever manufactured with powers-of-two components. (1KB = 1,024B)"
2.0,Sandisk finally admits that defective micro sd cards cause battery failure in the galaxy s3. I had  mine about six months before it failed completely. I submitted complaint to sandisk and await their response.
2.0,Sandisk quality has failed me. Moving on to another brand. I've had three of these memory cards fail on me in very short order.
2.0,I have always used SanDisk products but this was a disappointment. It totally failed in my Galaxy S3 after about 8 months. I will order another brand but no more SanDisk for me!
2.0,"So far, so good.  It does what it's supposed to do.  Doesn't seem any faster or slower than any other micro SD card I had.  Bought a cheap imitation on Ebay and regretted it as it crashed.  It really doesn't pay to be cheap with memory.  It's all about the reliability, which you get with this product.10/17 Update:  Big problem with this SD card if you are a Windows Phone user - does not properly record HD video.  Video recording to SD card is consistently choppy.  Pop in another SD card - records fine.  Record to my phone - records fine.  I've tried formatting it every which way and it isn't working well.  Go with another brand Windows Phone users."
2.0,"I ordered this memory card because, obviously i needed more space on my phone. One of the reasons why I prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android. My memory card arrived when I expected it to and now I have more than enough space on my galaxy S4....... I once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when I was satisfied with it. But now I'm having problems. I can't delete stuff of of the sd card. I tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now I'm giving it a two star."
2.0,"I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I'm mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn't have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that's when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I'd rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one."
2.0,"I think that this product by itself is a great product.  However, not all devices is built for microSD XC.  And not all devices like pad and phone that specifically states that it features microSD with compatability to microSD XC.  This happened to me.  Since I just bought a new pad, I thought that it would be compatible.  However, it did not.  the microSD XC is formatted with exFAT so my device can detect the hardware but it can't write or read from it."
2.0,Used it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet.  Stopped working after about 10 months without warnings.  My tablet now recognizes as blank or un-formatted card; my computers won't even recognize it at all!  I am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card...
2.0,"After I inserted the micro SD card to the adapter I can no longer removed it from the adapter. It was stuck inside the adapter permanently. I definitely received a defective item. I also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectors.Another, while I was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an error.Sandisk's quality control department should up their game. They're selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed (not all of them BUT a lot of them). It's just not me. I also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective."
2.0,"I can not say it is a bad MicroSD Card, but mine Stopped working after a few months of normal use.Every time I put it into my PC or Smartphone a message came up saying that I needed to format it, But when I click on format, it showed another message saying that it was unable to format it..... The one I purchased to replace it is a POLAROID which by the way is working better than I expected.While it lasted it was perfect."
2.0,"I used it for something like 10 months in my Galaxy S III (GT-I9305) with original firmware, mainly for pictures and flac files.Suddenly I perceived that the last pictures I took disappeared; I took some more pictures as I thought that were software problems but same problem until I realized that the card was not working. Now I can't write it anymore or delete information, format it, delete partition, etc. Now is a ROM. The bright side is that I did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card."
2.0,After exactly month and a half this card is done...and with it i lost all my pics and videos...just after the return policy expired!! card is not recognized by my phone or PC. Trying to get RMA from Sandisk...I own the S3 and have read extensive problems with the 32 and 64gb card class 10! Samsung says is Sandisk...and Sandisk says is the phone ??? But i've seen other cards failing with different phones! All Android by the way...What's the problem ?
2.0,"Bought this to use in my Samsung SIII as it was supposed to be a fast card. Worked fine until it totally died after less than a year of very little us due to the design of the SIII. Phone popped up a message that the SD card had been removed (it hadn't). Nothing I did to the phone brought the card back up. Removed it and tried it in my laptop (Win7) and other computer (XP Pro) and it is totally dead, neither will even recognize its in the drive. Working with Sandisk to get a replacement, they want all kinds of fairly useless information, will see if I get an RMA number and replacement card.This is the first memory card I have ever had fail.As an update, warranty service from Sandisk has proven to be non-existent. They first asked to have over 16 questions answered, then mysteriously lost all the answers I sent back, three times."
2.0,"Sorry to say but I have to pull down rating from 5 to 2. The card went bad in just couple of months. No option to return as its beyond policy.The card came on time, good packaging and works so what else to add for this 16 GB SD card."
2.0,"For the first two months, the card worked great in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.  Then, one night, it randomly stopped working.  Amazon won't take it back, and I've got an email into SanDisk to see if I can get it replaced.  Now I'm out $52 and now can't use my camera.  Thanks so little."
2.0,I am not sure what happened to these cards but I have owned several and they stop working quickly.  I sent a message to SanDisk and never heard back.  Very disappointing!
2.0,"If you have a gopro, get a different card, it worked in mine for a while then stopped, turns out the gopro fried it, no fault of gopro but through sandisks error, sandisk will replace it but it can get fried again. I've read up on it and it's a common issue, so if you use this for a gopro, get a samsung or patriot or something else to be on the safe side."
2.0,"The storage works for my phone but when you install the storage into the SD adapter, my computer doesn't read the data."
2.0,"Its going back because it doesn't meet spec.Tested with  H2TestW, write speed is only 9.69 MB/s. Read speed is good at 18.80 MB/s. (although Sandisk claims up to 30MB/s)Meanwhile, a class (10) 32GB Transcend SD card I have writes at 15.30 and reads at 18.20.I also have a few class (6) 4GB Sandisk microSD cards writing at 15.40 and 15.50. Reading speed is 18.40 and 18.30.I also have a class (4) Kingston card that beats this class 10 Sandisk."
2.0,"If you were looking for a class 10 microsd card in order to DIRECTLY transfer files from your PC to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class 4 instead of this one. The speed is not much different than other class 4 microsd cards I've had. It's very far from the 30mb/s they promise, I got only about 4.5mb/s AT MUCH, and after a few minutes it's downhill from there. I tested on both windows and linux and didn't see a difference. Luckily there's not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class 4 and this one but then again, maybe I didn't look at the class 4 the way I should have since I was focused on getting a class 10. Oh well, you've been warned. Don't expect magic from this card.UPDATE 12/11/2013: Sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them. The reason I didn't contact them first it's because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help. It is indeed a waste of time. After sandisk comment I contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange. My suspicious were confirmed and I indeed wasted my time:Daniel S.: Hello, thank you for contacting SanDisk. My name is Daniel S.. Please give me a moment while I look into your question.fer da: heyfer da: i just got this answer from sandisk:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMA7XPN7IDZD/ref=cm_cd_notf_message?ie=UTF8&cdForum;=FxFNZEI17MH7ND&cdPage;=1&cdThread;=Tx7VKC9UPWNI9X#Mx3FKEEV0WIILE3Daniel S.: Please tell me what is written on the face of the memory card?fer da: never thought of contacting you because i thought i was just going to waste my time, but it was nice to be contacted proactively by youfer da: okfer da: the same thing as the one on the picturefer da: sandisk ultrafer da: microsdhc Ifer da: 32gbDaniel S.: Please allow me a moment.fer da: will you need more info from the card?Daniel S.: The Sandisk Ultra card is a UHS-I card and provides optimum performances when used with a UHS-I enabled device or card reader.fer da: my phone is off.. lolfer da: it says that it is a class 10 card, i bought it because of the promise of better speeds than the regular class 4 when using it with my phoneDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that you will get the minimum read speed of 10 mbps on a UHS-I enable device as the card is built on the UHS-I technology.fer da: and write speeds?fer da: i'm getting like 4mb/sfer da: a far cry from the 30 MB/s2 promisedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that so I said the card is built on the UHS-I technology it will give the optimum speed with an UHS-I enable device.Daniel S.: You will get the minimum write speed of 10 mbps with an UHS-I enable device.fer da: okfer da: waste of time confirmedDaniel S.: I would like to inform you that if you'll use this card with an UHS-I enable device it will give you the optimum speed as it's promise.Daniel S.: Is there anything else I may assist you with?***removed one star because of the sliminess of contacting me via amazon to show ""sandisk cares"" but not really offering any real support when contacted."
2.0,"I bought two of these Memory Cards for use with my Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera's. So far, I have found them to be unreliable. I am not entirely certain if this is because of the Camera system or the Memory Card themselves. The camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted. This is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important, the failure of the SD card would be very troublesome indeed."
2.0,"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand."
2.0,"I was very excited to buy this card (64 gb) for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - The product arrived promptly and I was able to format it to EX Fat and use it right away in my smart phone. However, exactly 10 days later when I removed the card (after turning off the phone) and inserted it in my Desktop, I got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that I needed to format it.Since I had already got a lot of data on it, including a lot of videos and images of our new-born twins, formatting was not a viable option.I tried to get the card working on my PC Desktop, Mac Air laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Note, but to no avail.  Finally I decided to format it. There too, I kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card.  Finally I tried ""Full Format"" via my pc - got an error again and then right away ""Quick Format"" and that worked - so the card is back and working in my Note again, but now I wont trust it anymore - not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videos.I am a professional photographer, and use memory cards all the time - this has been the worst of the lot !!"
2.0,"Worked great for about six months in my s4 and last week it started having device connectivity issues.  The phone keeps saying ad card removed, resetting the phone lets the memory card work for maybe 30 minutes.  Very frustrating.I have 30 gigs of media, I would appreciate scan disk resolving this issue with me and the product"
2.0,SanDisk told me I needed to send this to them to format it. It will not recognize in any of my items.
2.0,"I used this product with my Dell Venue 8 Pro.  After a couple months of use, it stopped letting me add new files or delete old ones.I tried reformatting and wiping the disk, but nothing worked.  Since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive, I assume I just got a bad one."
2.0,"im using this card on my galaxy note 2 but it's slow, and phone constantly unable to read the card"
2.0,"I bought this to because I wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening, this does not support music files so I have no need for this. I've tried hooking it up with the Flash card it came with, I've tried putting it in my phone and hooking my  phone to the computer, I've tried through my mp3 player...nothing. I can't even get Windows Media to recognize the flashcard. If you're looking for more storage for portable music don't buy this."
2.0,"I ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week/weekend.  I began loading some files (music, videos, pics, etc).  The first card worked without any problems.  The second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors.  At first, I thought it was my hard drive that was failing, and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine.  Ok, maybe I received a dud, and tried with another card from my purchase.  Same results, cyclic redundancy error.  I started searching online, and found a utility via one of the reviews on Amazon called H2testw.  Ran the test on both cards, and it reported errors.  It also reported write speed of only 4MB/sec, which is way below advertised speeds.  These items were in retail packaging, and I remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes.  I guess the retail package cards aren't any better.I should have waited to do the refund because now I have to process the refund seperately.  I will test another card to see if I have better luck.  I wanted to leave a 1 star, but I gave 2 stars since 1 card worked so far.  I have 2 more to test.Very dissapointed because I was a fan of the Sandisk Ultra series for being reliable, but I guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit.  I would have been extremely upset if I used these cards for anything important."
2.0,"I got this to use in my Acer Iconia W510-1422. When I went to format it it only shows it as a 27GB. I put it in one of my other computers to double check. YUP oddly 27GB. Fluke? Miss representing? Did I get a bad unit? Not going to return because packaging is gone and not interested in paying for the return. It works, it is fast, no issues, but only 27GB."
2.0,I am now awaiting a replacement from Sandisk because it failed after the Amazon return period.  Always had good luck with Sandisk cards until now.  Phone and PC simply stopped seeing the card.  Lost all of my data (which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere).
2.0,"While out and about in a photo shoot I had this card fail on me. Luckily I'm a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so I only lost a few pictures. Card completely died and had to be sent back to Sandisk for a replacement.The whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk support.I know about memory so I always have multiple cards available and if I'm out for an extended time, spread my work out over cards to minimize risk.What about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories. Sure  they are at fault for not backing up their data. Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I'd say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved. I can't recommend this card though."
2.0,I bought this for my Samsung galaxy s4. I don't know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time. My wife's phone doesn't do it as often but still does it. Very fast but unreliable. I have had many sandisk before and this is the only one I have had problems with. I have read that there were some that were poorly made. Thinking I will send it back and give it another chance.
2.0,Worked once I was able to find a system to format it.Second card from SanDisk that was sent to me unformatted.They need to get their act together...
2.0,Got a defective memory card.  Showed only 1 GB instead of the 64 GB.  Returned it for a replacement and never got the replacement!  Got my money back and went to Walmart.
2.0,"Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.  I have purchased aelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)to use the 64GB MicroSDHC card as a thumb drive."
2.0,"I ordered two 32GB and two 64Gb versions of these memory cards (but I can write only one review per Amazon). Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. This is not the Amazon shipping that I remember."
2.0,"I bought two as a back up for my Gopro Hero 3.One from Amazon the other was a gift from BB.Both did not work in my cameras, thinking it was Gopro's new update.Kept getting a SDERRI returned other and it worked with no problem.NOTE to all, there are boot-legged products out there It is hard todetect. But of all the Items I've received from Amazon/Prime and beyondHave been great. I just got stuck with a bad batch.GoPro recommends HX,HC,XC and extreme micro cards."
2.0,"Got this for Galaxy Note 2. Started receiving ""unexpectedly removed"" messages. Now card is dead and no longer working.  This can be Googled for known issues. Will be contacting Amazon for replacement.  Felt compelled to share."
