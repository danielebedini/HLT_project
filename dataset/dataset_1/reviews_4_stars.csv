4.0,No issues.
4.0,it works as expected. I should have sprung for the higher capacity.  I think its made a bit cheesier than the earlier versions; the paint looks not as clean as before
4.0,The memory card is an excellent condition and work as described. Dependable and easy to use. An excellent choice for the enthusiast who requires more storage.
4.0,"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars."
4.0,"everything about it was great, except for the adapter.  It was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it. so my fault i guess, but i also bought a 16gb version and the adapter for that one was fine."
4.0,"Used in my phone it's plenty fast and works just like it should. Unexpectedly comes with mini and full SD card size adapters, which is nice. &#34;Fool-proof&#34; packaging or whatever it was, that was laughable. Packaging was decent it just shouldn't have bragged about being impossible to mess up when I messed it up."
4.0,"I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn't really matter at least for Android phones. didn't really worth the price difference"
4.0,good card. work as describes. haven't had any issue with it or going pass metal detectors. no lost files or missing files.
4.0,"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it."
4.0,"I got this memory card for my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was running out of room on my Sandisk 32gb Class 4 micro sd card. I also wanted a faster and more durable card. I was hopping to put lots of media on it. In addition to nandroid backups and custom roms. I later found out that since this card is formatted in ex-fat it would not work to make nandroid backups or flash custom roms. Most custom recovery and custom roms dont work with ex-fat. So my only choice was to format the card to fat 32, which meant I couldn't put any files larger than 4gb on it. Besides that this card is great and very reasonable price of $50. If your some one who doesn't root their phone or put custom roms, nandroid backups or put files larger than 4gb than this will not affect you. This memory card is fast and provides the most storage you can put on your mobile device at this time. The card is also water proof, shock proof and comes with lifetime warranty. Ive never had any issues with sandisk memory cards or usb flash drives. They last a really long time."
4.0,"I bought two of these one for Asus infinity and one for Samsung galaxy s3 international version. It worked fine with my Asus but it didn't work on my phone. I formatted this card using the phone,the tablet and my laptop  but didn't work I did some tests with apps using some apps nothing showed its not working the only way I got it to work is by formatting it in my Canon SLR camera."
4.0,SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter...Works fine.
4.0,"I bought this for my son's tablet for cartoon videos, movies and &#34;all&#34; games he will be downloading (He's under 5 yrs so they'll be small simple games)."
4.0,So far so good. I bought a samsung micro sd card from bestbuy and it somehow erasedeverything. So this is my second one. Hopefully it keeps all of my stuff
4.0,still have 26 gb left came in HARD CASE  FORE PROTECTION
4.0,"Cannot go wrong with SanDisk and to date it works as advertised. The price wasn't a great cost savings but because it came from Amazon which has a great reputation to date as far as I am concerned, I purchased through them."
4.0,No problem with storage and speed. I only had some difficulties to insert it in my card Kingston reader: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Flash-Memory-Reader-FCR-HS219/dp/B00109Y2DQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356544341&sr=8-1&keywords=card+reader I believ due to a sticker covering something in one of the sides. Other microSD do not have this kind of problem with that reader.
4.0,Replaced one that crapped out in my tablet - taking most of my apps and a few hours of my time with it.
4.0,"I use this for a Raspberry Pi, in the SD adapter, and it works so far.Also appeared to be the genuine part, although the prolific Sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years.I like getting MicroSDHC cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes.  For example, let's say I buy a used phone or e-reader that needs a memory card, and I'm not using my Pi -- I can just take the Pi's card, take it out of the adapter, and put it in the other device, rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one."
4.0,"This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while there cheep! I got mine for around $30."
4.0,"It is a memory card, fast as any other class10 card, and SanDisk units rarely lose data.  I wish these guys would keep their marketing on the backside leaving some white space on top so we could write things.  The cheapo-brands do this but not the big guys - idiots."
4.0,Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my Note 8.  Seems quick enough for my Canon G12.  I would recommend this.
4.0,Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked right away with no troubles.  Only time will tell. :)
4.0,"Bought this memory card as a spare for my Samsung Tab 2 10.1.  It works great, and allows me to bring extra movies, songs, and audiobooks with me to play on the tablet when I travel on vacations."
4.0,Bought this to use in my 8 inch Onda tablet.  No problems or issues installing or using.  Have about three months.  Would recommend to others.
4.0,Initially when I inserted the card into the Samsung Galaxy S3 it recognized it but it wasn't able to format it correctly. After doing some research I found a free program EaseUS Partition Master [...] that will format the card into FAT 32 since Windows no longer allows you to do it by default. After formatting it into fat 32 the phone recognized the card and it works great now. I hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem.
4.0,"In some situations, depending on what hardware you intend to use this card in you'll need to format it in a special way using a formatting utility that doesn't come native to windows.  Also, the card gets extremely hot under heavy load."
4.0,"Is very stable and when i use this product in my samsung galaxy 7, sometimes the tablet don't recongnize the memory but the problem is maybe the tablet not the memory i think"
4.0,"Not as fast as advertised most of the time, actually slowed down my Note 3 when I filled it with movies leaving only about 8gb free, switched to a faster card due to that, but it could also be the phones fault. All in all it's a good card with good speed and size for the money."
4.0,"Product works as advertised. No issues with install or general use in my mobile phone. It doesn't seem particularly snappy, but that may be more the phone than anything else."
4.0,"Quick little puppy, SanDisk makes nice quality stuff with one exception.The adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after 4 days.Adapters, psh!But my Transformer likes it, treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system (a recent store bought one wiggles?!?)"
4.0,"Replaced a smaller and slower micro SD card in my phone. I've had other brands corrupt and die in the past. I've grown to only trust SanDisk.It is faster than most other micro-SD cards, the price was right at $27."
4.0,"The card looks good, works fine, I didn't do too much test with it.My only complaint until now is the package, there's a line marked on the back for you to cut, I cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so I cut near the card, only to found I cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now I took it out, and no storage case to store. Not a functional problem, but annoying."
4.0,The SanDisk Ultra 16GB memory card has shown no sign of not being exactly what I needed.  A good deal.
4.0,"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!"
4.0,Would not work in my Samsung Galaxt Tab 2 7.0 3G that I purchased it for.  But it does work fine in my Asus TF700. So I swapped the cards between them and everythings's OK.  First time I've seen this with a Sandisk product.
4.0,Great card for a great price read and write speeds are on par with what is posted on the specifications detail report.
4.0,"Be aware--if you want to use this device to record and play high-definition video with files greater than 4gb, you'll need to format the card as exFAT or NTFS (if you want to play the files on either a PC or a Mac. But it works well after properly formatting."
4.0,"When I placed this in my Galaxy S4 phone it read it right away at 29.7 GB. Which is expected to loose a few GB. I transferred file from my old card and it was done fast. Although I didn't have large files to start with. I had been looking for a large card and this one fits the bill. The other reviews helped sway my choice. I would recommend this card, so far no issues."
4.0,"I got this card for my phone. I was expecting a significant increase in speed. I have not really noticed any great speed improvements. The card is working great with no problems. Just get a slower card for your phone, you won't notice the difference."
4.0,"I really like the performance.  Since I put it into a USB 3.0 adapter, I get about 27MB/s actual measured throughput."
4.0,"I just bought two of these for our two new Samsung Galaxy IV smart phones.  The adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these MicroSD cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the USB &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now I don't worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips I might want to show someone on the phones."
4.0,"I bought this as a gift for a co worker he went from 512 megs to 32 gigs what a difference. Although it will take him a while to fill it up, he still enjoys it compared to his old one."
4.0,"I have a GoPro 3 camera with which the cards (64Gb and 32Gb editions) work perfect.Formatting went perfect, movie recording and picture taking without any problem for the last 6 months now.However, I tried to use it in a Contour+ and the Contour GPS and both cameras are unable to use the cards, I presume these cards do not fit the Contour specifications (unable to format, no way to record on the card).So make sure the card is compatible for its intended use."
4.0,I have bought it for around 6 months. It works good so far & both read / write speed meet the described specification.
4.0,Works well. Beware some of these SD cards are not what they say they are. This one is in my Nokia phone. Loaded maps and songs on it. No problem.
4.0,"Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago)  for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3.  It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed.  Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it's safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse.  Today, the card is totally unreadable.  It can't be formatted by the phone.  The PC doesn't see it at all.  It's dead, Jim.  I'll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE:  I've updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge.  Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well.  Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them."
4.0,Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Tab3. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card.I would recommend this card to everyone.
4.0,"its a memory card and has the reputation you expect from SanDisk. I thankfully didn't get a knock off, counterfeit, card because It was bought official threw Amazon. it works as advertized and at full capacity (59~ gigs after formatting, which is to be expected) it has good speed for things like games movies music and photos (view/shooting) I've owned it for about two weeks now and its been reliable giving me no reason to doubt it.if you have a low capacity phone/tablet/device you should buy a card and SanDisk is probably the brand you should go with. the price is rite (through Amazon) and they are backed by both the manufacturer and the distributor with a warranty (Amazon A-Z 30 day, and SanDisk- 6mo parts I think it is) its better than you can get with budget or discount cards you find elsewhere.I recommend this product to customers looking for quality storage space."
4.0,"Performs as it is supposed to. 16gb is quite a lot of storage plus my Samsung Galaxy has 15 gb of internal memory for a total of 32 gb. That's plenty enough to store hundreds of hours of music,"
4.0,I bought this card for my Phone. It gave me the extra storage for my pictures and video that I needed.
4.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for to upgrade the memory of my smartphone. Good transfer speeds to using SanDisk product, and great pricing from Amazon."
4.0,As new products evolve they only accept SD and microSD cards. I've had good luck with SanDisk and this is no exception.
4.0,"Well not much to say...its a good mmc and its fast enough and that's about all you can ask for, using for more storage on my tablet.Update: stopped working after a while, computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour I could not fix, it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters I used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn't even read because of the error. It stopped working after amazons very short return policy so I was out of luck with them, luckily SanDisk has a very long (10-lifetime) for its ultra brands, even though it was a hassle and all through email only I got a replacement and that's why I only took one star off"
4.0,I cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class 4 or 6. I use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly. Dont see a difference. But it has advertised capacity and works ok.
4.0,"I bought it to expand my Surface RT tablet, reliable and stable my data is intact and secure.Highly recommended"
4.0,It works fine in my Verizon Galaxy S3 but has to be formated to FAT32.  Also works in my Canon IXUS 80.
4.0,"Fast , no problems , i loved the price and it worked immediately , never caused me any problems.... Oh just remembered when i place it into the sd card to make it fit into the pc ,,, usually the micro sd get stuck in the holder , that i did not like"
4.0,"What can I say SanDisk has the micro SD figured out.  Works with Asus Memo pad hd 7, movies for long trips."
4.0,"I purchased this to use in a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It worked fine for about a month, then the phone stopped recognizing it. I was able to copy my photos before the computer stopped recognizing it as well. SanDisk replaced it under warranty and so far the new one has been fine."
4.0,seems to be working just fine...bought as a gift for a family member and they're using it for video recording.
4.0,Probably enough storage space to handle most people's personnel information needs.  Just don't forget where you hide it.
4.0,"works as expected and was nice that it came with a holder. Not sure what else you can say about a chip, either it works or it don't? One never knows until they use it for a while how it is working..."
4.0,I did not do any bench tests to see to verify the read and white but been very happy with it.
4.0,I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 when it was on sale. My fairly new internal card reader wasn't able to write to it so I tried 2 different USB adapters and they didn't work either. I installed it in my phone and was able to copy files via USB. It was slow but it worked and is great in the phone.
4.0,"This card is doing its job in my S4. Lots of room for storing photos, music and videos. Good item."
4.0,Works great in our smart phones.  Gives us a lot more memory.  Comes with an adapter if you require the ability to put it directly into your computer with a normal SD slot.
4.0,"Good card at a good price but I bought it specifically for my gopro camera. Even though its a class 10, its not fast enough to record on the higher quality settings. I guess not all class 10 are the same even among the exact same cards. You will need to buy the extreme version for gopro."
4.0,"Love Sandisk, never had a problem with them and still have not. Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy Relay 4g running Android 4.0.4 and the phone detected it without a problem. Has the write speeds expected and gets the job done. Would recommend a different card if you plan to go to 64gb, buy the Samsung UHS-1 SDXC, writes at much higher speeds and has less lag. Would buy this again for the cheap price, fifty elsewhere.Sincerely, iSklcndykid"
4.0,"I bought this to go along with my new S4 that I purchased and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how much 32GB can get you on a phone!  I have pushed all of my apps to my SD card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone (a major detraction placed on the S4 especially).  I do notice that since moving most of my apps to the card, some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going.  This may lead me towards going with more powerful SD cards in the future though I am assured this will work for all of my current needs."
4.0,"The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB is just a storage device, so I don't find that there will be many ""features"" to get excited about. That being said, it is advertised as having 30MB/s transfer speed, but this is misleading. It can READ up to 30 MB/s, however, and the packaging says this too; it writes at a slower rate. I used this for my phone (too much music) and had the stock 8 GB microSD that came with my phone. I had about 6.5 GB of data that I wanted to transfer back to my new microSD card, and this took about 30 minutes. If this were a strict transfer from my internal hard drive to an external it would be faster, but this is not such a connection. It lost a star because the transfer took so long, but in reality, I don't expect to be transferring 6 + GBs of data anytime soon so this problem will be minimal for me. Other than that it works great, and I have not had any issues with the formatting or reading."
4.0,"I picked this up to slam into my s3 phone & it works greatif you are thinking about it for that just order it.If you have an s3, 64 gig is the largest card it will support"
4.0,"The description on the Amazon page calls this a class 10 card with UHS-1 performance.  And while technically correct, (Full HD 1080p recording). You would expect more performance in the Sequential Write speeds.  It actually doesn't even hit the class 10 speed unless you round up (9.951 MB/s).  I have 2 of these cards and they both report the same speed.  My Kingston 8GB SDHC Class 4 writes at 11.854 MB/s.  Now keep in mind the Sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes.  So maybe the design for those faster random reads and writes causes the sequential writes to run slower than expected.

4.0,These are great little cards and are very fast. The only thing I hate about microSD is that they are so dang small and the slots are spring loaded. I have lost a couple from them shooting across the room.
4.0,I use the phone with this card in combination with an Eye-Fi Mobi card  to back up photos when I'm in the field.
4.0,I added this to my Samsung S3 32gb phone and it works great. I can store most of my music for when i travel. I will nevery have to listen to the same thing on a signal trip.
4.0,"Purchased it for use on my Samsung Tab 2 as well as my Note 3.The msd card came with 3 possible formatting : NTFS / FAT /exFAT. The default is exFAT, and there seemed to be some comments saying that certain devices might not be able to read exFAT.Being the smart alec I am, i decided to format it to NTFS, assuming that my android devices will work with it. Tab2 was not able to read NTFS, and I had to reformat it back to FAT in order to get it work.Subsequently, I tried using those USB-SD card reader (those that looks like a tiny usb drive)and realised that apparently the SD card formatting is too new, and it simply will not register as 64GB, but can only read up to 32GB.Have not tried on Note 3 yet, but should work seeing that the technology is pretty on par."
4.0,i used it on my sony as15. been using it for almost a month now and i have yet to encounter any problem
4.0,This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that's all I use.
4.0,"Price was right, shipping quick, Class 10 card for HD video in my GoPro.Hard to rate it since memory cards are pretty much memory cards. Nothing jumps out as excellent so that is why 4 of 5."
4.0,"I've gotten four of these for both of my Nikon D7000's and have had little bit of an issue with the adapter cards being out of spec and sticking in the Nikon Camera SD Slots, and one of my card readers. Sure enough, i sanded one down carefully and it fit perfectly.Performance wise, these things scream over regular Class 10 or Class 6 cards and perform nearly excellent. I cant complain other than I wish they were faster, but I'm not getting that for a while at $23 per card."
4.0,This memory is the right price and it worked right from the start.I think this is a good deal and good memory.Works fine in Note 2
4.0,"I bought this card as an addition to my 32 GB Galaxy Note 3. I have well over 32 GB that I use for music with scads left over for apps and movies. You may never need this much space, but some of you are like me and we WANT this much space. With my 3.0 USB the transfer speeds are very adequate. Can't wait for the 256 GB ;)"
4.0,"stil not getting the write speed as I need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card!"
4.0,"It's been a month now with this SDCard in my phone.  I transfer an average of 3GB of data to and from the device per week.  The SDCard is holding just fine.  Where most tend to crap out or cause problems, this has yet to do it."
4.0,"Sandisk is the premier brand in flash memory and this card came at a good price. Speeds are fast enough to work inside of my 1080p dashcam and has been running consistently for a few weeks now. Good brand, speeds as advertised, and reliable so far. No complaints."
4.0,The only thing is if you use this product on Andiod you must format .  Windows machines don't seem to supot FAT32  .  winwods machines will open files but the format program on Win only formats NTFS and EXFAT  which is limting because Andriod uses FAT32.
4.0,"SanDisk were the first Memory cards I came across years ago.  I think they hold up very well against the competition.  They are inexpensive and do the job.  I am a huge Kingston fan, but the price of this card was too hard to pass up.I currently have it in my phone for Photo & Video storage.  So far, no complaints."
4.0,This is big and fast for me. I prefer having this side so I wont run out of space and the speed of 32+/- is all I need anyways.  Highly recommend it.
4.0,"So far its been fine, no problems other than when installed phone only read 59.45GB instead of the 64 GB, thats the reason I'm only giving it 4 stars.  If anyone can give me a answer why it only read 59 instead of the 64 please let me know!"
4.0,"Bought it for my tablet.  it works well, and it has been working now for about 6 months.  I have no complaints."
4.0,"I cannot say if it's the SD card or the phone, but google sez it's the phone. Put your MP3s on this card for your Galaxy S3, and the result is a jumble of corrupted files. Yep, that's what I got. So, in fairness to SanDisk, I gave this card 4 stars, and a suggestion to y'all out there, get the 16gb card for your S3 instead."
4.0,Previously purchased two ADATA microsd cards one which never worked and one which failed on the second boot.So far no problems with tht sansdisk chip.
4.0,"The advertisement calls this card a ""class 10"" card however I was not able to get ""class 10"" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s. However, if you are thinking of getting this memory card for an Android phone and don't want to pay big bucks, this is your card. Stop reading and buy it, I'm glad I did."
4.0,"...to have both the micro and the adapter in the same package. I only had to buy ONE package to get the items I needed for my Smartphone and my digicam.  I replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one, then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera, then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapter.I would have given it 5 stars, but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months! Truthfully, though, I don't know if it's because the product is defective, or if I just handled it too much or incorrectly. So I feel 4 stars is fair."
4.0,"After purchasing three of these (one for myself and two for gifts to others) I read reviews that said they sometimes just quit, and it's difficult or impossible to recover data.  I have only been using my own card for 2-3 weeks, but it hasn't failed yet.3/27/13 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months, the phone started chirping every few seconds, telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card.  The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card apparently just decided to fail.  Thank goodness I only had info for one small app on it, and only need to access it about once a week, so it's not real critical.  Thanks to Amazon's 30 day return policy though, I will probably just have to eat the cost of this one.  Unfortunately, I read the other bad reviews about this product after I had already purchased mine (2 of them, but my wife's hasn't failed YET).  My advice is to stay clear of this product, and maybe SanDisk in general."
4.0,"It reaches read speed of about 24MB/s and write speed of about 18MB/s at optimal situation.Other than the speed, everything is fine. I'd like to say the color is quite a good thing, because MicroSD could be so small that you put it away for a few seconds it will easily disappear. With the bright read and light grey color, it is much easier to find, because it will not blend into common background.Also, the quality looks good, not like some of the MicroSD cards, this is a ""unibody"" design that you cannot tell from appearance that where is the circuits. The SD card adapter come with it is in quite good quality too.In summery, good design, good quality, not too satisfying speed. It will be a judgement call to say if it worth it or not. But to me I can totally go with it."
4.0,"Using this in a security camera that I have mounted outside. It does the job of recording the pictures and video. The first one failed and had issues, but this second one seems to be working well."
4.0,"This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don't hesitate in buying this, it's a steal for the amount of storage you get."
4.0,"For $20 I can't complain about those speeds too much.  I put this little guy into a super mini MicroSD reader to stick into my truck stereo for MP3 storage.  I use a USB3 memory card reader to populate the card with music, and my truck stereo seems happy with it."
4.0,"I have not utilized the card as much as I had hoped I would, so I cannot comment too much on the speed, but my tablet (Asus Transformer Infinity) certainly has plenty of space on it now."
4.0,"The micro SD card was extremely fast.  Writing and read files were very fast even on a slow USB 2.0 interface.  Mechanically, the card is tight in the adapter.  Needs a screw driver to get it back out of the adapter.  Tried on another two adapters with the same results, tight fit.  If user plan to use this as a normal size SD card, it is an excellent card.  If one plan to switch between &#34;phone&#34; (micro SD card) and camera (normal size SD card), then the tight fit might be a problem.  Vender service was excellent.  shipment was faster than expected.  Would buy it again even with the tight fit.  It was an excellent value for a very fast card (camera can shoot burst mode without slowing down to write to card)."
4.0,Received it as promised. Inserted it into tables and was acknowledged that it is there.Guess it will work as expected also.
4.0,I put it in my tablet and so far nothing to complain about. Will see how long this one can last.
4.0,SanDisk makes some great memory chips for a decent price. I can' recommend no names brands because of their error frequency.
4.0,"works great so far, but gopro filled the card pretty quick recording at 1080p. So I got a 64GB a week later."
4.0,I had to replace my other 32G MSD Card. Was not aware of the Card Speed issue and as a result started loosing video and pics from the card as they became corrupted. Did a little research and found out the card write speed was the issue. Did not make sense. But replaced the card and yes it works. Have not lost a pic or a vid since.
4.0,Love this 32gb micro sd card. I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I just returned from a 3 day trip where I used it as my camera/video recorder. I kept it on HD quality the whole time. No problems at all. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. If that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance!
4.0,"Works fine my Virgin Mobile HTC EVO V. The phone didn't recognize it at first, but after formatting it's all good."
4.0,"I got this to upgrade my surface pro 2's storage and it works nicely, what do I store on it? Bunch of MP3's and games on steam.It works well, the games run fine, boot pretty quick, the one issues I had was installing the games, sometimes the card would vanish from the drive and I'd have to pop it in and out to get it to go again, however I feel like that could be software related as nothing like that happened while playing a game.Best idea is to install the game on the surface, move the files over manually to the card, &#34;tell steam to uninstall the game&#34; to erase it from the list, then hit install, point it to the folder on the card, then it'll spot the files, download only a few things and bam, it works.About the card itself, I wouldn't rely on multitasking off this thing, as it's not meant for that- as in if you're playing music off this card, do not install a game at the same time. It's fast at 1 thing, not many."
4.0,"The card was working great. I own quite a few for several of my devices. One that I bough in 2012 suddenly died. I went to the SanDisk website and did a chat support. The Tech tried some quick troubleshooting and after about five minutes asked for my info for an RMA. The process was quick and easy. Like I said, this one suddenly died, no idea why. Luckily I didn't have anything important on it at the time. This is the only one I've ever had fail, and like I said, the RMA process was a breeze. I really like these cards and the customer service was great. For reference, I run these cards in a Samsung Galaxy SII (hercules) - 32 gb, Motorola Droid (sholes) - 16 gb, Motorola Droid 3 (solana) - 32 gb, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) (GT-N8013) -32 gb, it was the Note one that failed. I also have a GoPro but I run the golden SanDisk cards in that, but they are twice the price! I will continue to buy these cards regardless of this isolated incident."
4.0,"I mean, its obvious lies, this whole 64GB thing.. you get maybe 60 if you are lucky..Seems to work ok so far."
4.0,"I can't give that much feedback on this because I ended up returning it. I was looking for the ideal memory mircoSD card for a GoPro and found a better model. I did end up filming one event on this card, and it did pretty good. It did end up lagging after some time though, just briefly."
4.0,"This card is fast! And cheap!  I used it on my Canon S100 Camera to shoot raw format pictures and 1080 video and it worked flawlessly.  I'm currently using it on my old Mytouch phone for storage.Great product, great price."
4.0,very useful for surface pro to increase capacity from 128GB. Can also be used as backup in case something goes wrong
4.0,"For this special price I could not let them go.I bought a few cards for my phone, my gopro and my camera.... Ideal"
4.0,Not sure what the point is of reviewing a stanard 32G memory card.  Purchased for a tablet and works fine.
4.0,"I used this to replace the existing Transcend MicroSDHC card in my phone. I find that only a few pieces of my equipment can access it - apparently some older firmware devices do not recognize 64 GB SD. One trick I found - I was able to format this in my tablet, then move it into my phone. Initially, my phone reported it as a corrupt SD. Other than that, I have had no issues with it - it is reliable and stable, but not lightning fast. It took me over two hours to copy my photos and music onto it."
4.0,I would recommend this memory card to anyone. It works well with my tablet. I have no problems with it.
4.0,There are things that I would like to say about the sand disk ultra.It is the best dang SD card I've ever used.  All rights so let's be honest I just put this in my phone so that I would have extra storage for photos and videosHowever it is really good because it just sits in my phone and I don't have to do anything about it.Seriously I can access everything by Just connecting my phone to USB so it is essentially like the phone has another hard drive.
4.0,"Good quality product for the price, I bought it for my go pro and I haven't had any issues yet."
4.0,"I bought this for my Android device and it works great!It even comes with a converter so if I'd like to use it for images or movies I could!I'd highly recommend this product to anyone needing memory for their Phone, Android Player, Camera or anything that uses SD and /or Micro SD!"
4.0,This works with my Galaxy S4 and is fast enough to record 1080P video. I would purchase again I have always had good luck with SanDisk cards.
4.0,Got this to expand the memory of my son's Go Pro camera.  It does the job for much less than the box stores had it for.
4.0,Excellent cards. I have this one in my ASUS Transformer  and a 16 GB one in my camera. Both work flaulessly.
4.0,"Alot of storage for a great price. Only one probkem: since I installed this card into my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, about once a month or so, when I turn the phone on in the morning it gets stuck in some sort of &#34;boot loop&#34; and hangs on the AT&T logo screen. My phone is stock, and I have altered the software in no way. Granted, I cannot be sure that the card is the cause of this problem, but if I remove it and then boot the phone, it works properly. I love SanDisk products, and I will definitely continue to buy them. Just a word of warning."
4.0,"My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.  Still satisfied, since I have more than 90GB of storage on my phone."
4.0,Works well. No problems after using it for a number of months. I've always found the SanDisk memory cards to be reliable.
4.0,Perfect for my SS Galaxy Note and a great price too!  I recommend this SD card for all your storage needs.
4.0,"It's good, I liked it, works perfectly with my Minidrive, but it's kind of slow, sometimes it doesn't reach the promised 10MB/s."
4.0,Love having the extra storage this card gives me. The transfer speed to the card is slower than I would like but it plays back HD video without a hiccup.
4.0,"got it at a great price and it worked great, was a little upset with the tiny size of the packaging as i almost didnt even see it on my step, it arrived in a 1/4&#34; thick cardboard envelope that was about 3&#34; by 2&#34;."
4.0,"Very fast, very big. Just wish it were a bit less cash so I could buy more for my other storage needs."
4.0,"I got this for my Galaxy Note 3, as it accepts add on storage.  Works perfectly, and I use it to store all my music and files so I dont junk up the phones memory."
4.0,"This memory card is exactly as advertised.  Being Class 10 it is nice and fast.  This card has been in heavy use in my GPSr since I bought it, and I've had no issues with it."
4.0,It's a good capacity but the speed is slow that is almost 10M...but it's acceptable to me. I like it.
4.0,"Works on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but I don't really stress these kinds of things.  I have had no problems.  Have not checked it for heat or any such thing."
4.0,"The first one i received died in less than 2 months. It just stopped reading (lost all that was on the card), but Sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it. Not so enthused about the speed. Transfers between phone and PC (USB 2.0) weren't impressive in my opinion, slow, but the bottleneck could be the phone, but still..."
4.0,I was able to use this microSD card with my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I just had to format it when it was in the phone.  The only reason not a 5 star is that it's not as fast as the more expensive versions.
4.0,"Works fine, as SanDisk usually does. I know there's a lot of discussion about transfer rates and so forth, but I'm fine if the rate isn't so fast or slow. I really don't care, long as it holds and keeps the data until I can transfer it. All these cards seem to me to be about the same. SanDisk is the big name and so I usually stick with it. But I have other makes that are just as good."
4.0,"No complaints matched description, was delivered on time and works well. Would easily recommend this to anyone looking to memory for their mobile device etc"
4.0,"I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We'll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality."
4.0,I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.
4.0,"Good size card and a great price. My only complaint is with the adapter card. The little lip on the end of the micro card is almost nonexistent and the adapter card slot is very, very tight. The only way I could get the micro card out was with needle nose pliers. Had to take a utility knife to the opening of the adapter card so I could actually slide it in an out with ease."
4.0,I am using this in my Samsung galaxy smart phone and I did not find any issue. easy to access
4.0,"The memory card runs smooth, and is as it says, class 10. The card also comes at a very good price."
4.0,"I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. This past weekend I couldn't get it to work at all.  I'm guessing it's the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I'm not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working."
4.0,No problems I have two and I bought one for a family member. She loves it. I need four more words. I will keep buying it.
4.0,Thank you Amazon for showing me what type of Memory Card and Adapter that I needed. I love buying everything I need at once to use my electronics purchases.
4.0,"this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times, my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so I have to reboot, not sure if it's the phone or the card, I got 2 of these one for me and the wife, her's never have any issues. I can live with it, it happens every so often ..."
4.0,"Good price and fast enough to load MP3 files from the computer quickly.  I use these in Sansa Clip MP3 players, perfect match."
4.0,Good value. It has great speed and memory for the purpose it serves. I wish my memory was this good.
4.0,"Seeing as how everyone in the family has some kind of device that can utilize a microSD or SD card, this item fit the bill and I picked up a bunch to stuff stockings with. These came in a basic white package with the adapter to full-sized SD. 32GB is a nice size, especially for all the new HD smartphones and tablets. I have had better luck with SD cards than flash drives -&#62; nearly all the flash drives I have purchased have died. I have had 3 microSD cards go south on me and zero full-sized SD cards go bad. I installed my stocking-stuffer into a car DVR dash cam where it has been recording my daily drives. Speed testing shows read speeds in excess of 33MB/sec and write speeds of 16-19MB/sec. Should be fast enough for most HD devices."
4.0,reliably turns my blackberry into a jukebox full of music & video files no buffering or stuttering to catch up
4.0,Speed squeaks in at a bare minimum of a class 10. Good for tablets and smartphones wouldn't recommend it for Picture or Video Camera's
4.0,"great value for money, works as advertised.  it is a sd card what else is there to say.  but this makes me write words"
4.0,"yet, but I will be soon. New in case and I look forward to using it!  I don't know what else to say about it!"
4.0,"It does what its suppose to do.  I use it in my Samsung laptop, I never remove it so its never a problem."
4.0,"The last card I got was bad, but at least this one is working properly.  SanDisk is the best brand."
4.0,I really like this SD card. It's fast and it looks good. Great value too. What more can be said?
4.0,"Purchased to add to the memory for my Windows 8.1 tablet (Dell Venue Pro) and it works like a charm!  Also, I shopped aroundand it was the best price I found!"
4.0,"Sandisk* is simply one of the best SDHC & MicroSDHC memory card manufacturer's that I have used for a number of years.I have experienced Zero failures, and they are reusable over and over.Also their adapters are quite handy to carry when traveling or at the studio.*Would like to see SDHC cards in the 1 to 5 Terabtye in the near future."
4.0,"this is the SDXC, so, it also required new reader that can read SDXC if you want to read in the computerMost laptop since 2012 support this model; however, the older laptops SD slot cannot read this cardIt is safe to buy a SDXC USB reader"
4.0,Just dropped right into the phone with no proble.  Disk works great and give me plenty of room for storage.
4.0,"Start at four stars.Plus one star, because it's FINALLY a 128GB SD card.  I have been longing for this for quite some time.Minus one star because its performance is spotty.  I've been using one in a Surface Pro for a couple months now, and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15MB/sec, it often slows to 1 or 2, even in the middle of a large file copy.  I assume that's due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something, but I can't imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phone.In the end, I like it well enough to get two, but it's really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements."
4.0,It works in my Note 2 smart phone. I don't think there is much else you can say about it.
4.0,It is ok for the price...but occasionally it has to be removed and reinserted or the device reports &#34;no card installed&#34; I think the contacts on these are a little flaky.
4.0,I bought these for my kids tablets and for their action cameras. They work in those 2 devices. Some other devices seem to like the slower cards.
4.0,very nice
4.0,"Works great in my modern phone and tablet. However I was unable to use it on my PC's SD card reader. It appears the older card readers are not compatible with Class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (Win7) reporting write errors.I probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card."
4.0,"I for one have not bought into Google's, or anybody else's, idea that streaming everything is so great.  With all the regressive data caps and sketchy throughput, I never want to rely on something being available to me online.  Much better to have it local.  And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher.  The only real bummer with this card is the speed.  Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk's 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful.  Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn't oversaturate the read performance.  What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you're listening to something.  This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry.  So long as you understand it's limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I've used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success."
4.0,"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!"
4.0,"Haven't used it yet.  It's my first encounter with a Micro.  Appears to be a quality product, though instructions for using the adapter would be welcomed.  Good cost and fulfillment.  Expecting it to function as advertised based on SanDisk's track record at our house."
4.0,"I bought this for my Samsung Note tablet 10/1 to store movies and books. I haven't watched a full movie on it, though I have watched a full TV show without issues.  I don't really do anything else that needs speed, so I can't say how fast it is."
4.0,"It is exactly what it is advertised to be. Shipped fast, and I love the converter that comes with it so I can plug it into my computer."
4.0,"I bought this for my Galaxy S4 to expand the memory capacity a bit more. It works as it is intended to do, fast transfer rate, no problems so far."
4.0,"I have several devices that use micro cards, so I buy these in anticipation of needs in the future. So I am not going to test this to see if it works when I get this. Most items I buy at a good price. Now if I am loading up cameras and recording gear for a trip or maybe a day at Le Mans. I will check them before I travel, as I check batteries and spares and chargers.So far I have not had a problem with SanDisk, I am gearing up for a trip, my destination is a bit in question at this point."
4.0,this product has worked well with my go pro 3 black edition not slow or glitchy love the products and do reccomend
4.0,Always bought Sandisk memories for my cameras and still satisfied. This time bought for the Galaxy SIII. The speed (Class 10) and reliability are worth.--Sempre comprei mem&oacute;rias da Sandisk para minhas cmeras e continuo satisfeito. Desta vez comprei para o Galaxy SIII. A velocidade (classe 10) e confiabilidade valem a pena.
4.0,"Disk works as expected, we rarely fill it up before purging contents."
4.0,Was able to copy all items from old memory card to this one. plugged it into the phone without formatting it and works like a charm. I have the Galaxy S3
4.0,"Love having all this extra space available. Sux that in future phones, Android is moving away from SD slots. I love having physical storage available, if I delete something from the cloud I can't recover it. With this that's not a worry.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because sometimes it feels a little slow. but it's nothing I can't deal with."
4.0,"This card seems to work well ,enough speed and so far it's working just fine ,good value for great quality ,LHB"
4.0,Works as expected. I was able to successfully upgrade my samsung galaxy s4 memory. Now my photos/videos are being saved to the SD card.
4.0,"Works well in mySony PCM-M10 Portable Linear PCM Voice Recorder with Electret Condenser Stereo Microphones, 96 kHz/24-bit, 4GB Memory & USB High-Speed Port - Black"
4.0,"A great chip and works fine in my camera and a tablet if you are just streaming music from it, but if you are putting this in in something high demand like a Raspberry PI or CuBox-i the higher speed chips are better."
4.0,"Pretty good price, great performance! I've been using micro SD cards for years, tried many brands mostly cheaper. There is a reason they've been around and will continue to be!"
4.0,If your not sure what card to use in your GoPro this one works fantastic. The majority of stuff Ive seen researching it points to these. With the exception of some issues with the 64GB. But I cant validate that and Im not sure its still a problem. Ive been using these for about 3 years now with no problems.
4.0,"I had to return this and get another one, as the first was faulty. I hear this is semi-common.Must not have enough testing, i might suggest buying two and returning one if you are in desperate or sudden need of one of these chips, no matter what size."
4.0,"Works fine, but it is becoming very annoying that even with flash devices you buy 16GB but only get 15GB. Why not just label it as the exact size?"
4.0,"Relative needed a new sd card, an upgrade from her 8gb and this did the trick. Great for any phone."
4.0,"I purchased 2 of these, 1 for my HTC Incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device. Both of these cards run very very hot.  After copying over 4GB of files, it was almost scalding to the touch.  But both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them, both times in the thumb drive adapter, so that may have been at fault and not the card itself."
4.0,"If your electronic calls for this size, you have to use it. But I hate it.  It`s too darn small to fool with. This one works well, but I will try to avoid this size in the futher."
4.0,Gets stuck sometimes in the adapter and is a little hard to pull out. But other than that is a great product
4.0,I use this with my GoPro 3+ Black. It works well. It'd be nice if it came with a little USB 3.0 reader like some other brands.
4.0,It is a memory card. It works and gets the job done. Hasn't failed on me yet *knock on wood*
4.0,Fast and safe very good quality and has an excellent performaceA bit expensive comparing to other models in the store
4.0,Does what is suppose to do. Good price. The delivery and shipong was fast. This isy third piece. I use it for my dash- car cameras.
4.0,"Got this yesterday, the 64GB item. Installed it in my new Samsung Tab3 and turned it on. the Tab3 saw it right away, and I decided to format it,,, only took a couple of seconds and I was good to go. It shows that I have 59,000 memory units available, they must use the rest for overhead I guess. I haven't used it yet, but I am sure it will work fine. If I have any problems I will note here,,, also if I have great praise for it I will note that also. At $34.99 I guess it was a good price as I see it is now $46.00, maybe I shoulda ordered two of them. This is my first time for a lap top, and I will be on a big learning curve. I got the lap top at Costco last week,,,,,,,, I sure hope a old dog can learn new tricks....."
4.0,"Really good deal, definitely a good way to save money  buying an item with less memory and buying one of these is a lot cheaper"
4.0,I bought one for my GoPro last year and ended up putting it in my tablet last week. Ordered another one for the GoPro. After the trip next week it will go in my phone. Guess I'll need another one for the next trip.
4.0,This is just what my S4 wanted! I have so many songs to take around with me that I had to get a bigger card and this one is great! No memory issues any time soon!
4.0,"Holds lots of video memory. Small, compact and convenience for travel. Due to the small size need to remember where you place it."
4.0,"Used in GoPro as other user reviews indicated the 32 and 64 GB cards did not work well.  Just buy more of them, I recorded over 1000 photos and 60 minutes of video on each 16GB card."
4.0,What can I say - its a memory card. It remembers what its supposed to. At least it remembers as well or better than I do.Only problem I have with these Micro SD cards is - they're so small they're easy to lose. If these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something.
4.0,Comore esta memorka para completar mi nueva samsunb galaxy tab y funciono muy bien...ahora tengo 48 gb de memoria para alamcenar info.
4.0,I'm finding more and more electronics are using micro SD cards.So I'm stocking up. Good buy for the price.
4.0,"Hard for my Mac to read. MHz be Mac, might be card. It's fast in a gopro, no real complaints"
4.0,I've been using this card on my Venue Pro 8 without any issues.  I used primarily to store photos and videos. The card is reliable but not fast.  Data transfers on Windows range from 15 to 20MB/s.  That speed is sufficient for most purposes.  I got my card at $32 which is s good deal.  A faster card can easily double this price.
4.0,The SD card adapter came in handy and we were able to use the card in my father-in-law's Nikon D3200.
4.0,Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn't let me down yet and no errors.
4.0,"works well with my hero3 black gopro.its not on the approved micro SD HC card list from gopro, but it should. works great and low cost - cant beat it."
4.0,"My camera required it, the brand has a good history, my experience with the brand over years has been very good, the price was ok, buying via Amazon is the easiest, least aerobic way to go.  I've not found cards much cheaper from other brands and personally like to stick with those with which I have good experience."
4.0,"Put this in my Samsung Active phone, works great.  My first chip started acting up so I needed to put in a new memory card.  Works just as fast as the on board memory, loads photos, videos, music really fast."
4.0,After a long research about the SD cards. I came across this deal. I wanted an SD card for my new Samsung Note 3. None of the review was talking about Note 3. Most of the reviews were either about note 2 or S4.A few reviews were talking about possible problem of not able to recognize the card and getting into the cycle where you have to call SanDisk. I was not sure to go for it or not. Although choices were very thin. Samsung cards were way out of my budget.So I decided to take a chance and I am happy that I did.It's working smoothly. No need to format. Just works great. One star for not exactly 64 GB. It shows up 59GB.I will again update this post after 1 month. When I will really sure it has no problem
4.0,"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk."
4.0,"I bought these microSDXC cards for use in my tablet, however, my tablet only recognizes FAT32 formatted cards and not the exFAT that these cards use. I had suspicions about this based upon other reviewers' experiences. Windows computers will not reformat in FAT32 beyond the 32 GB limit. I was able to locate a small program that would reformat a drive to FAT32 without the 32GB limitation (FAT32 can accommodate up to a 3 TB drive). I used the Windows GUI version of fat32format (freeware) and it quickly reformatted the memory card. Now the card works in my tablet."
4.0,Its just an SD card. works as good as any other. I don't know what else to say about it.
4.0,"16gb is a good amount for what I use it for and SanDisk is #1 fir sd cards, I'm satisfied."
4.0,"I recommend anybody to get the 64gb Scandisk Ultra from Amazon, if you are looking to expand your tablet or any device memory. This product was delivered on-time with simple to open packaging. Inserted into my Windows 8 tablet and was able to save, edit, and so on with no problem."
4.0,"Large storage, perfect for tablets (using it on Asus T100, after maxing out 64GB very quickly), but maybe too slow comparing to SSD, as it's the first memory of this kind to reach the microSD format, that's an acceptable tradeoff."
4.0,My T100 Transformer read the card immediately. Nice and compact storage solution. Does the job and you won't be disappointed.
4.0,"Great value. Fast shipping. Brand you can trust.My previous card by &#34;another manufacturer&#34; died after only 3 months of use, along with everything on it.For 64 GB, this card is a beast of a value. I've dropped my phone hard several times and had no data lost from this card. It's fantastic.My primary use is recording 1080p video and high rez pictures to the device, as well as audio recordings. I use this for media.  It's fast transfer speed allows it to keep up with all my demands. Only time will tell how truly reliable/durable it turns out to be. I'm going on 2 months now as of January 2014. Any adversities I have along the way, I will post here in updates.Smashing good value of a card!TIP: When you first get your card, be sure to use your phone (or other device you'll be using it in) to format it. This is standard practice with all card based memory, and will prevent you from encountering errors or oddities with your device."
4.0,"And it got stuck in the adapter they sent with it, had to break that open.  It fit in another adapter though"
4.0,"I am rating this product with 4 Stars, simply because I have yet to learn if my Samsung Galaxy Note II (purchased on 11/03/12) is causing &#34;defective&#34; and &#34;reformat&#34; messages to ocassionally appear on screen or this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A is culprit. However, I have yet to &#34;loose anything&#34; stored on this card. Otherwise, if the messages did not appear and/or I learn for sure it is a phone problem, I would rate this card with 5 Stars."
4.0,16GB Kingston - class 4 - micro SD (Amazon '#1 Best Seller') = 4:30 @ about 5 MB/s16GB SanDisk Ultra - class 10 - micro SD = 2:15 @ about 10MB/sResults from my informal data transfer test. Copied a large 1.3GB video file to my two micro SD cards.This SanDisk Ultra takes about half the time to transfer data. Time is money and I'm happy with the results considering the current Amazon price is about $11 vs $14 for the SanDisk Ultra.
4.0,"Pro:  Small, fast, and priced OK.  This is basically a class 10 card; file access is noticeably faster than a class 4 I was using before.Con:  not really noticed anything."
4.0,"Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy."
4.0,Both of these items arrived on time and tested out at 9.8MB/s write and 19.8 MB/s read using H2Testw.exe.(500 MB file size). I would have given them 5 stars if the write-speed was just a bit faster.
4.0,"Bought it while it was one sale for $35.... I love itIt has given my Surface some wiggle room.Don't expect the read and write speed to be super fast. Most likely you computer doesn't support the current protocol to transfer at the Max speed.Overall Quality you expect from SanDisk though I think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microSD expansion aside from Samsung"
4.0,"I bought this card because I hope to transition from a PC to a smartphone in the near future. For now I use an adapter to run it on the PC. The write times aren't as good as I had hoped, but they're acceptable overall. Plenty of storage space for my files, some of my music, pics, that sort of thing. Have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part. Overall, a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks done.Sidenote: the card came formatted with exFAT by default. The onyl way I could downgrade to FAT32 was to use a third party app. For some reason, the card can't be read by my phone, but the phone is an older model Samsung, so that could be the issue."
4.0,"Review for: SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-064G-AFFP-A),This product arrived via USPS, its not in any individual packing from the manufacturer, it was placed in an SD case together with the adapter.  So, I am unable to verify warranties or authenticity. The Samsung S3 recognized and formatted this with no problem.  It sees it as an external memory with 59GB.  The Six GB is probably allocated for FAT/File allocation table.  Will order again from this seller!"
4.0,These things are supposed to work flawlessly aren't they? Anyway this does. Didn't need to format it in my S4 - went straight in no probs.
4.0,Used it in an android phone. Worked fine and is decently fast. It did not quite reach the rated speeds but came close (could just be the controller that I am using).
4.0,"I bought three of these--one to replace my old 1 GB card and two for first-time users to add to their phone memory. These cards work fine, and none of the three had any trouble."
4.0,"For me 32 gb is sufficient. I don't need more then this.Running easy, safety, and SanDisk is a great mark."
4.0,"A standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory.  Grated, if you have an older android phone, or older tablet, you probably won't see much difference.  But if you have a modern device like a galaxy s4, or note 3, or equivalent mobile device, you'll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device.  For modern phones, a UHS-1 memory card is a must.  The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because it's not a sandisk extreme, or a sandisk extreme pro.  But then again, you must have EXTREMELY specific needs to want to get 85MB/s transfer speeds on a mobile device.  For movies, music and apps, this one is more that adequate."
4.0,Great Price and works great with my Samsung galaxy s4.Such a relief not having to worry about space for pix and apps.
4.0,"Definitely, SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) is working as advertised. I'm definitely happy about this product. The price was definitely worth it."
4.0,"Bought this for use in my phone to expand the memory in it. I have the 32GB GS3. I wanted to double the memory of my phone but I wasn't sure if my phone would take a 32GB card; it did and I'm happy with the product, I also loved the easy-open cardboard packaging. I like that it's easier to open and ship but mostly I like that it's not plastic since I hate the excess trash that puts in landfills."
4.0,Great Product. Works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. Very responsive and fast.Enough capacity for 8 hours video and great price. Grabbed in thanksgiving 2012.
4.0,Good price for a good size micro SD.  Not the fastese card that I have used but for the price I am satisfied.
4.0,No complaints as yet.....It came with an adapter as advertised. I wished that I had purchased two instead of one.
4.0,A great product and a very reasonable price.  It has increased the Galaxy Tab 2 memory and useability without having to deal with other interface cables.
4.0,"i like it, good product next time i will order the bigger memory. i will recomend this product to my friends"
4.0,Phone is a galaxy s3 from virgin. Still getting sd card unexpectedly removed but I do know it's an issue with the phone and not the card.
4.0,Perfect for HD video production. This will hold a lot of stills and videos with a reasonable write speed - No complaints...
4.0,"These cards worked flawlessly with the GoPro Hero 3+. Instead of opting for the bigger card, I got two smaller cards to start with. That way I could transfer data to my laptop while still using the other card. If you're wanting to do an un-assisted, large record, like a time-lapse, or something, opting for the bigger card is smart, but for my usage being able to swap back and forth was invaluable.So far, no hiccups or problems, even with the faster, more beefy shooting settings."
4.0,"This SD card USED to be one of the fastest. Now it is merely adequate.I bought the 64GB version and inserted into my Samsung Galaxy S5 (latest Samsung phone).The performance, although still adequate, is less than stellar. For example, to load the Amazon Kindle app, which is about 35mb and I purposely placed it into this SD card, it takes about 7 full seconds to load. The same app on my iPad takes around 2 seconds to load.Still, if you aren't too much into your smartdevice performance, then I wouldn't worry. But if you do care about how fast your smartphone can take pictures (assuming your pictures are stored in SD cards) or how fast your apps will load, then you should purchase a much faster SD card for your latest phone.Pros:1)Adequate performance.2)Hassle free packaging.Cons:1)Not the fastest, but still adequate."
4.0,OH my gosh this is the greatest invention since sliced bread. I am totaled underwhelmed and it works too. xx xx
4.0,"I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero 3 camera, as it was the one recommended by most buyers. I've had zero problems with the card, and the included adaptor makes it easy to transfer my videos to my PC. These things are tiny though, and thin so be careful not to bend or lose them! The $24 price is reasonable as well."
4.0,This is my first foray into the microSD card world. I bought this for my GoPro Hero3 white.Pros:- comes with an adapter for easy downloading.- simple to format right out of the box.- reads/writes just fine with no errors.Cons:- the adapter has no spring return like the devices you instert the card into - removing the card from the adapter can be a pain.Overall it's great and does what I need it to do.Hope that helps...
4.0,"This works well in my Galaxy S4. I use it for media storage. I did have to reseat it once as I kept getting an error about ""Preparing SD Card,"" but I think that was more about how I put it in my phone than about this media. I think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phone.UPDATE - I deducted a star because this card has a capacity of 32 billion bytes, but not 32 GB. There is a difference. The storage is actually around 29 GB because 32,000,000,000 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 = 29.8 GB. It's still a very good value and I would still recommend it highly, but do understand that you are not getting 32 GB."
4.0,"This was purchased for my cell phone. It was easy to plugged in, and my phone recognized it instantly.The adaptor that comes with the device I had some problems with. The adaptor has a write protection switch, that both my Toshiba and HP laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the SD slot. To get around this I have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle, and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion. It works, but it is a pain. Fortunately since the chip is in my phone 99% of the time it is not a pain I deal with too often. It is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized SD slot of a laptop or computer."
4.0,I use this for my cell phone ( Lumia 810 ) and it works fine. the transfer speed is a little slower than other memory cards I have used but not by much.
4.0,"I put this in my mom's ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR to provide an ample amount of storage for all pictures, music, and movies. This performs very well and we've experience 0 lag so far. Great product."
4.0,Needed an inexpensive SD card for my new HTC One M8 and this was a perfect choice.  Works perfectly and thus far have no issues at al with it.
4.0,I use this everyday with my Microsoft Surface and I'm very happy. No issues and great speed. Wish the prices would drop even more though.
4.0,"been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it's a memory card."
4.0,"I used this Memory Card to Expand the Memory in my Smartphone. It worked as expected and was easy to setup. I copied the Stuff from my older MicroSD Card to my computer, changed cards, gave it a couple of minutes to Initialize, and copied the stuff back... Worked great."
4.0,Good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for SD card size. It didn't forget what I put on it so I guess it works.
4.0,The memory is fine but the adapter that it came with was useless.  I did not contact the seller about it since I had another to use.
4.0,This item works great with the Garmin Dash Cam 10 and Garmin hand held topographic GPS. Good value/deal for the money.
4.0,"I would recommend this memory card to anyone that has a  cell phone, or a tablet pc.  This memory card is fast and efficient."
4.0,"Good case, it is nice that it comes with an SD adapter, fast transfer of pictures, over all good memory card."
4.0,"It's a nice product, worked perfectly with Windows 7. However, it doesn't quite work when placed inside my AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3. Files copied into it are NOT shown in the S3's file browser. Googled a bit for this problem, and I concluded it's my phone's problem."
4.0,Unerstand that these cards may come in different formats.  I had to reformat on a Windows XP machine after finding a HP utility via Google to get this to work properly in my SAMSUNG Galaxy Note 2.
4.0,"I'll never need another/bigger Memory Card.  It's fast, plugs right in. It didn't need any setup etc..  SanDisk is a quality brand."
4.0,"Purchased for use in a dash-camera. Have been using for 2.5 months now without any issues. Not sure what else to say about it, hopefully I get a couple years worth of use out of it."
4.0,"Very good product that I am using with my smart phone. As usual, Amazon packageing was acceptable and it didn't take forever to open as some packages seem to take."
4.0,"It's the top end besides the stupid expensive Extreme.  It works fine.  I've had 4-5.  I'd get cheaper ones which I suspect are about as good, but slow or fail isn't worth it to me to save a couple bucks.  This just work, and work fast."
4.0,I have this in my phone storing the majority of my MP3 collection (400+ albums). It loaded 30Gs of music comparatively fast. And never seem to have any problems with skipping or stuttering I've had with slower cards. Probably would be a solid selection for video (I haven't tried it yet) and photos save off quickly allowing follow-up shots I would have missed before.
4.0,"works great in my ASUS android tablet. the 32GB specification seems to limit the size, but it works great, some I am happy to write more words."
4.0,"Only been a month or so but best price, quick shipping and MASSIVE storage.  I didn't run speed tests or anything but no issues.  I will edit this review if I have a problem down the road."
4.0,"Even the website ([...] had this card in the picture of what i'd be ordering. When i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes, and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one. Turns out android HATE class 10 cards and much more prefers Class 4 cards because of the way the OS accesses LOTS of files at once, and Class 4 timing is just better for their computations. Only the 1 star off because of my own expectations.Otherwise this is gonna make a great camera card, hopefully the pics take faster (it's certainly a size upgrade atleast!)."
4.0,I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Work Pro 12.2 Tablet. It woks so what else can you say?
4.0,"It is a 32 gb micro flash card.  It was bought for an Optimus Ultimate cell phone.  It works just the way it is supposed too.  It gives me added space for pictures, and comes with the full size adapter."
4.0,I feel that San Disk seems to make the best memory cards. -I can't validate technically but this seems to be fast acess and seems to be problem free. I have confidence that &#34;must have picture&#34; will be captured properly.
4.0,I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.
4.0,The only drawback that I can assign to these SD cards is the limit of a 5 year warranty unlike Kingston.
4.0,I've used Sandisk cards for as long as they have existed. These cards are fast and have the solid quality I expect from Sandisk. Recommend.
4.0,"Not a lot to say about it, it's storage.  I haven't done any speed tests or anything but it definitely works in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I don't see any performance issues watching videos files stored on it."
4.0,Purchased two 32 GBcards  for the two new Samsung S4s in or family.  After using for several weeks no issues at all saving a variety of files - photos and Office documents.
4.0,"I bought these in hopes to replace my standard Sandisk 64gb models for quickness.  I'm not saying they are lightning fast, but they are definitely faster than the standard version.  I bought one for each of my phones and my tablets,  They work great.  When the 128gb is available, I will try the faster version of those also."
4.0,"After having my first ever failure of a SD card, a 32GB SanDisk Micro SD card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes, and before I could salvage anything on it. With the refund from Amazon of the 32 GB card I purchased this 64GB Ultra card as the replacement for my phone.After having problems getting the full 64 GB seen as an individual 64 GB and not a partitioned into two 32 GB files on the card, and the secret is to NOT format the card in a computer, format the card IN THE PHONE, then via USB or WiFi you can add back all the content,It is seemingly working great, seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and I just hope it will continue to do so. I am much more contentious about backing up though, with Android, Amazon and Google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next 'just in case' time."
4.0,"First off, companies need to mark these right, they consider 1000mb to be 1 gig, when 1 gig is actually 1024 mb.That means you will end up with 62 gb &#60; and in all actuality it will read as 59 gb in your device &#62;other then that this card works awesome. I would highly recommend it!one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data."
4.0,I bought this to use I'm my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. So far so good. Simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it
4.0,"This is a 'set-it-and-forget-it' item. Solid performance without issues. I forgot it is still in my Sony camera, Love it"
4.0,This is a very fast and reliable microSD card.  I used this on my Galaxy Note 2 and loaded movies and family pictures.  Transfer time is speedy!
4.0,"I couldn't put any files onto the card that were &#62;5 Gb. A little disappointing since I wanted to store movies on it, but I guess it's a limitation of the MicroSD HC technology."
4.0,Great value for the price.  Comes with an adaptor so it can be used in multiple types of devices.  I have had no issues with it and would recommend it.
4.0,"I still think i have sometimes problem reading with the memory, but i can't prove it, still works, never had an error by reading or writing, so 4 stars for you!"
4.0,To be honest i purchased this because my son said I needed it with my tablet...I'm sure it will be fine...
4.0,"With this card I picked up for $35 amazon's black friday sale, I increased my GNII's storage to 80GB! It transfers data at about 15MB read/write, which is well below advertised. However, this is very similar to the speed that my GNII's built in storage transfers data at, so when running large applications off of this SD card I see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself."
4.0,"Good product, it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described. It was considerably cheaper than any other store I found. I specially like the speed of this SD Card. However do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated. The speeds are way faster than normal SD CARD speeds and you will notice it, but not anywhere close to whats advertised. There a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed. This is not the manufacture or seller fault, but it depends on the system that is being used."
4.0,"Even though it's a class 10 card, writing data to it still takes a while. However, the card performs well in my phone. If you can get a good deal on this, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"i bought this sandisk ultra 32 gb micro SDHC memory card for my go pro hero white edition, is really good anD works perfecly, try it, you wont regret!!"
4.0,"Its a good Micro card, self explanatory, I haven't had any issues with it. Works for just about putting anything on it."
4.0,"It arrived quickly, was easy to install, now, if I can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device..."
4.0,good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does..
4.0,"Card works great, but the adapter was too loose to make full contact with the micro card to facilitate connectivity to the card reader.  Minor issue since I have several adapters... But it's worth noting."
4.0,I wanted a good sized SD card for my Android phone. This one was priced well and has been working without a glitch.
4.0,I have been using it for over a year now in my galaxy S3 and it seems fast and reliable.  Do we really know how good they are until it goes out or crashes?
4.0,"i love this micro sd.  It enables me to expand the storage space on my Acer W3.  Great price too,"
4.0,"Works well, as advertised. I like the Class 10 speed. Price was right. Would recommend this product to others. Thank you."
4.0,This rating is based on multiple years of use of this memory card. Its reliable and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a memory card for long term use.
4.0,"I bought this to expand the limited memory of my Dell Venue Pro. I use it to store MP4 videos and MP3 music and streaming/playing both work very well. Even the description explicitly says &#34;Reformat into file system other than exFAT may cause instability&#34; I'd hope to use it to remap my OneDrive (FKA SkyDrive) folder which requires it being reformatted to NTFS.  The warning is correct--between Windows 8.1, the tablet and the SanDisk MicroSDXC the OS became unstable.  Once I'd reformatted and changed OneDrive's location to it I rebooted Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 could not detect the card. I reformatted the card back to exFAT and it works as expected."
4.0,"Have had no issues and does what is advertised.  Very handy.  Quite happy. :)I've used it with:  Windows 7, Mac OS X.Formatted as: FAT32 and NTFSVery good card. :)"
4.0,I just received this micro sd card. Everything works so far. I purchased 2 for my Galaxy s5 and my tablet. So far so go.
4.0,It's a memory card. What else is there to say. This is a Class 10 so it reads and writes files very quickly.
4.0,"It is a good match for the Sansung ATIV.  I don't know that I have used it yet but, it's in there."
4.0,"Something this small with so much information stored on it freaks me out. But I've had zero problems with it over the past year. The only issue I had is that the adapter that came with it did not work. The microsd card went into it kind of sidways like it was made wrong. Luckily I had another adapter lying around, and the sd card itself works perfectly and I've had no issues with data loss or corruption."
4.0,Haven't had much time to place items on this card yet.  Formatted to my Samsung Galaxy Tab no problem.  Seems to do the job will keep you posted if problems arise?
4.0,"Worked as advertized, loads fast.  Only problem was pulling it out of the adapter after Loading it on my computer."
4.0,"the extra room on my phone is great but ive noticed since installing it that its a lil slow when transferring files from my phone to the card, its not like im sitting there forever but its a noticeable difference between my old card and this one"
4.0,Was very concerned when I realized this sd card was NOT the correct one for go pro.  But all seems ok at this time.
4.0,"I tested it in several UHS-1 compliant devices and found the write speed at 11-12 MByte/Second. Sounds fine for a class 10 card but this is not what I was paying for. I don't expect it to run anywhere close to UHS-1 interface speed (104 MB/S) but it should be close to 30 MB/S as the manufacturer advertised. I have a lot more choices if I am only looking for a class 10 card.Indeed, microSD cards are usually slower than full-size SD card. They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great. It works great with my tablets, PCs, GPSs and phones. That is what I like about SanDisk. They do thorough compatibility tests before product release."
4.0,"CompactFlash is just about perfect to use in a camera in the field. As the size shrinks, so does one's ability to easily handle the card. SD is getting marginal as far as usability in the field. Forget about changing a Micro SDHC card unless you are back at your computer! Too small to handle and easy to drop and loose!However, with the 32GB and 64GB cards, that's not quite an issue especially if you leave the card in the camera! The camera is larger than the card my a great deal. Set it down and it's a lot easier to find and handle than a micro card (shown twice as large as life when I was writing this review).My cards came with SD adaptors so that they would be useable in my work flow, a plus. Also, within the adaptor, I can use the card in devices with SD slots and download using my existing readers."
4.0,"I purchased the card in the Sandisk packaging, so I am pretty sure it is genuine. I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right."
4.0,As Advertised.  Appears to be working okay. No faults have occurred yet with the micro card.Would buy again. A+
4.0,"Item arrived in a timely manner via USPS (surprisingly).  I bought this card to go in my GoPro camera, it fit in there gerat and now I have 3 hours of recording time."
4.0,Don't really use this for speed tests or anything but to hold music and everything it works great would recommend doesn't fail a lot and lose files
4.0,Not a great deal to say about this. SanDisk is a reputable supplier and it was simply a plug-and-play installation for the phone. It is a memory card and it works.
4.0,We bought this for our new camera when we were expecting our first child. We use the camera about once per week (the iphone is just easier and usually takes a better picture for some reason) and we transfer the photos to our PC. It has worked well and we have no complaints so far (7 months).
4.0,"When the price is right on these these memory cards, why not buy for it a late model tablet?  I could  also  make this a review for Class 4 Kingston 32 GB MicroSDHC, which I bought from Amazon at the same time.  The Class 10 cards will work in the late model tablets.  While there might be a small speed boost in booting up and having the tablet ready to run compared to a Class 6 or a lower class card.  I would say it there just isn't that huge of difference between this and lower speed cards.  I would say it's what inside the tablet that will determine it's boot-up speed more than the card you put into it.  In different devices such as cameras that can use this type of card this may very well --not-- be true.  But brand name and cost are the determining factors for what I buy to put in my tablets."
4.0,My granddaughter wanted this for her phone so she could put songs on it.  She loved the card and its capacity.
4.0,Love this product. The card easily integrated with my cellphone. Small and very portable. I would gladly recommend this product to my friends.
4.0,"I like the storage capacity of this little gadget. Purchased for use in my SmartPhone. SanDIsk has shown itself to be a truly reliable and quality storage device company and should do well in years to come.  This 32 GB micro  memory card comes with an adapter so that you can use it for other purposes.  They tend to be a bit on the pricey side, but you can't beat Amazon for pricing.  Go ahead, get one or two of these, they are a worthwhile investment, and you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"I ordered a 64 Gig card, and the card received states it is a 64 Gig card, though it only hold 28 Gigs of Data! I got ripped off. I did not check it until after the 30 days had passed. But it appears to be some sort of scam. The card is clearly marked 64 gigs, and I have checked the card in two tablets, and two computers it is only a 32 Gig card.Edit: The company directed me to a tool to reformat this card and I was able to get close to my 64 gigs of data, though I do not like using third party tools. I have Windows, Mac and Linux systems and any of those OS's should have been able to format this card correctly. I will minus a star for having to use a third party tool. Otherwise these are great cards."
4.0,I have had no problems with this memory card. Owned it a couple years and transfered it from phone to phone.
4.0,"I know armed with this in my Android tablet and wearing my three wolf tshirt, I will be the envy of all geek girls who will be uncontrollably attracted to my Asian maleness."
4.0,No problems with this micro SD. It works and works again. And then you know what? It works even again
4.0,Whats not to like? It is what it is. I always buy this brand of cards and drives. They have never failed me.
4.0,"The price is goodthe looking is nicethe speed is goodit came with an adaptershipping speed is excellentI used it with my Surface Pro & Samsung Galaxy S III, working good on bothThis is a good choice to have :)"
4.0,"This Micro SD card really is 64 GB and Class 10.  Too many bogus devices out there, but this is the real McCoy.  Tested with 3 different Android SD Card Testers and they all report Class 9-10 read/write.The only problem is the SD adapter did not work so I had to use another one I had.  Other than that, this is a great Micro SD card at a good price."
4.0,Works perfectly well in my Samsung Galaxy S4 without having to format to do any configuration. A WORD OF WARNING ABOUT THE ADAPTER IT COMES WITH. THE MICRO CARD IS A VERY TIGHT FIT AND CAN BE ARDUOUS IN REMOVING THE MICRO CARD FROM THE ADAPTER!
4.0,"Once I figured out the S3 wasn't liking the exfat file structure and formatted to fat32 it works quite well. I don't know if it's the phone or card and I'm not about to test it elsewhere, but I didn't see the 30MB/s speeds. It works good enough for the phone and it's the best option I have for the biggest storage for now.1080P videos with no issues. No problems with read/write stability. Overall I'm happy I bought it."
4.0,Easy to use.non stick and bulit well.would buy again no question.hope it last longer than the last.only issue is it's longevity.Last one lasted less than 3 years.for that price it should last longer
4.0,Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven't had any data loss or other issues.
4.0,"Not a bad product at all. I got it for my blackberry Z-10. I had to format it through the phone's software, but afterwards it worked like a charm. A couple months on and no problems. Class 10 and 64 gig, so I have no complaints. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it isn't particularly outstanding in any way, but it is a pretty simple product. Does the job, no problems, good to go."
4.0,"It fit, and it appears to workI have not yet had ANY issues with this cardhowever, I have only been using it for a few weeks...so my comment is based on my experience thus farIf my position changes, I will delete this postso, if you are reading this, then no problems has occurred thus far"
4.0,"Bought two, one for me and one for my husband.  Works great.  Feels good to have a lot of space on my smart phone to save pictures, movies taken, etc."
4.0,"Excellent product, High capacity, well made.  Holds many pics, movies, and music...a gift to the camera buff.  I've always wanted a hi-capacity item by SanDisk."
4.0,"Over the years, I've found SanDisk memory to be durable and reliable. This 16 GB Class 10 card appears to be no exception. So far, it's performed well. I especially appreciate the fast write speed. For the money, it's a good deal."
4.0,It works as expected. I use one of these on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and another on my Asus Transformer. No problems so far.
4.0,Using the card in a Sandisk Sansa Clip+ and it works! 4000 songs and counting. What more is there to say?
4.0,"SanDisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at times.You'd think that online prices would be more affordable. It can be but you can Not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot not.The one I received was genuine. Any of SanDisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so I've not had a problem in exchanges with the company **knocks on wood**!The 32gb version works well with Android tablets but not the 64gb versions so beware. I did read online at other forums that the 64gb version works relatively well, though, with Android phones, which is weird.Why would it work on the smartphone but not the tablet?Prices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around."
4.0,"I noticed amazon had the 'ultra' version for only a couple bucks more than the standard black version. And this one comes with an SD adapter in case I ever need it. I haven't bothered to speed test it since I'm using it for the tablet and don't feel like removing it from the tablet just for a test - but seems fast enough from my experience so far. Definitely faster than the regular black sandisk cards.From my experience with Sandisk products, their read/write speeds are much faster than they claim in their conservative estimates. It's not worth messing with their standard line if you can get 'ultra', 'extreme', or 'pro' for not much more."
4.0,"There is no question about Sandisk, and their continued innovation with really keeping storage from any computer for those on the go. With any need for electronic files, or music or games securely stored and protected from computer to phones and MP3 Players and tablets, Micro SD Cards are becoming a increased need for laptops and computer needs. Sandisk has made several products through time, and they have continued to get better with innovation. Their Ultra Micro SDHC memory card handles very well. It works nicely with storing all my media files into one convient package. I like it because I can safely have all my MP3 files, in this card and play them with my Sandisk MP3 Player nicely. This is definitely a good buy for anyone that really wants a bit of extra space. I definitely recommend this Micro SD memory card for all the extra storage space.Price: BConvience: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
4.0,"What can I say? It's memory, the price was right and it's fast. My galaxy note 10.1 doesn't complain. Neither do I."
4.0,"Found these for a really good price.  Bought 2, one for my wife and myself for our Galaxy Note 2 phones.  Hers worked fine but I did have an issue right from the start.  However, luckily it was right from the start because I had almost nothing on it so I reformatted in the Galaxy Note 2 and it has worked fine ever since.  It is recommended not to format it on the computer so I formatted it with the phone.  It works good as for now."
4.0,"I am using the 64 GB card in a Galaxy Note II phone and have had the card working perfectly from March to October. The speeds were fast and it always worked flawlessly.Then one day I decided to protect my data prior to going to Europe by encryping the card in the phone.The encryption process went properly and took about 3 hours (as my card was filled with about 18 gb of mostly image files).However, the phone then slowed down considerably and it took up to 10 second to decrypt the card every time I woke the phone up the screen. Needless to say I didn't like that and decided to return the card back to decrypted state. I did the procedure of decrypting it back and when it was done, the card became urneadable. Attempting to format it in the phone as well as in the computer with various utilities programs did not help. The card showed those old folders being present despite multiple formats but I could neither access the files nor permanent write to the card. (The phone could save pictures to the card while it's powered on but after restaring the phone, the newly taken pictures were gone).I contacted SanDisk who graciously exchange the card which now work great again. I give the card 4 stars just because I don't know whether the experienced problem was due to the card or the phone. The SanDisk has shown itself to have great customer service and I really appreciate them exchanging the card. I will definitely not encrypt it anymore. When card works, it works super fast and reliably."
4.0,"Do your self a favor and get some memory for that fancy new phone.I have taken countless photos & videos, downloaded several apps andloaded a bunch of music and still have room to spare."
4.0,Works great. Only problem is that if i put the card in a multi car reader it does not read the car. Has to be put in a SD CARD ONLY reader to work and be read by computer
4.0,Purchased this for my Galaxy S3 phone. The phone has 16 GB internal memory and you can't use this with it. Luckily it came with an adapter and I use it in my card reader for storage. I go from the PC to the phone. Its worth the money but remember its useless with the Galaxy S3
4.0,"Purchased this for my wife's new Samsung Galaxy 5S since she takes so many photos and always runs out of space before downloading to her computer. Okay, who am I kidding, she NEVER downloads them to her computer. I have to do it because, well, I'm a dude and dudes do that sort of thing. Most women (notice I said *most* women) let the guys handle the tech stuff and my wife is certainly no exception. I'm not saying women aren't or cannot be tech savvy, but mine isn't. Ask her a question about hair care products and she'll talk you into a daze, expounding on the virtues of quality, expensive conditioners but she prefers to leave ""that techy junk"" to me. And God forbid if I accidentally write ""your"" instead of ""you're"" in an email but that's for another conversation, preferably over Captain Morgan Special Reserve. However - if I ever need advice on what shampoo to use instead of Pert shampoo and condition-in-one, she will be my go to resource!PROS:It's little, bitty memory card, careful, it's easy to lose.CONS:It's little, bitty memory card, careful, it's easy to lose."
4.0,very usefull to use in the phone also they come with the adpator to SD i will remomend it :)
4.0,"I purchased this card for use in a Microsoft Surface Pro tablet -- for that, it works great. 64GB is a nice capacity, card was cheap and it works just fine.The problem, however, was in transfer speed. It's rated at &#34;up to&#34; 30MB/sec which I guess is true.. but mine has never reached anywhere close to that. Using 3 different readers (the Surface Pro itself, a higher-end desktop PC with built-in MicroSD reader and an external USB 3.0 MicroSD reader.. in all, it maxed out around 10-12MB/sec (and on multiple smaller files it maxed out closer to about 5MB/sec total). I know it's not the card readers as I have been able to reach speeds of 90MB/sec with other/faster cards.The card itself DOES work fine. For that I give it 5 stars. The price is great for the size, for that I give it 5 stars. The transfer speeds are just disappointing though.. taking 5 minutes to transfer an iTunes movie file is a long time.. it'll take hours to fill the full card.. If you only load data once, it's not so bad, but if you're always adding/deleting/moving data, it's slow and will get annoying quickly!"
4.0,"Nothing wrong with it so far. Definitely enjoying it, going to turn it into a bootable card for emergency recoveries, as well as store my device backups on it. It will be my magic-computer-fixing key."
4.0,Use this in my GoPro 3 silver edition.  Even at 1080p/30 I get about 9 hours of video.  Write time is great and I have had no problems writing video to this card real-time.  I have been happy with all of my SanDisk purchases.
4.0,It was exactly the memory card I ordered. I tested it using the adapter that came with it by plugging it into my computer. Worked great.I replaced the 8 GB card already in my new tablet (a month old) with the new 32GB card and everything ground to a halt. Waiting a long time made no difference.The maximum card size for my tablet is 32GB. I guess for now it's just an ornament. That's why it was the unexpected. That's why it only got 4 stars.Update: the memory card may not be at fault.
4.0,"Used the h2testw software to check the read/write speed and got write 9.8MB/s and read 16.6MB/s.

4.0,"What's more to say, this is the biggest MicroSDXC card at the time with the reliability of Sandisk with great speed.  I have one in all of my tablets and both mobile phones.  I have yet to have an issue with this card and don't expect to."
4.0,For the price these cards provide a good compromise in terms of speed and cost.  I use them with IOGear USB 3.0 adapters and they work well in that capacity.
4.0,I believe that this was a good price for this card its being used in a go pro without any issues.
4.0,"It stores stuff like any other memory card.  Amazon - fantastic price.  I bought this for my Samsun Galaxy tablet 3 8.0 and it works perfect.  This maxes out the memory for that tablet.  Tip: store all your apps etc on your tablets internal memory and photos, movies, pictures on this card.  If you ever run out of space you can keep and extra card or two on hand.  If you store apps on this card then you will not be about to use them if you want to change out the card."
4.0,"Great MicroSD, fast and holds a ton of memory.  If you really need one buy it and you won't be disappointed."
4.0,"I have this in my Galaxy S 3 and it works great, I've had no problems with it. Highly recommend."
4.0,I got this for my Galaxy S 2 phone and it worked right away. I had an issue with the write times slowing down after a month so I issued an exchange. It came promptly and my new SD card works great.
4.0,I have always purchased SanDisk products. This works alright it went bad in 2 months and sandisk replaced it. I have not had any issues with the replacement that Sandisk sent.
4.0,Never had any issues with sandisk adapter card or devices. They work great and this one is no exception. Very small media for my big fingers but I manage. to do what I need to with it and it works well. Last thing is that Amazon's prices are hard to beat!
4.0,"I bought this card to expand the memory in my Note II. Works well, no complaints so far. Will probably purchase a 64 GB when this one fills up."
4.0,"So far, so good. No complaints, does what it is supposed to do."
4.0,Fungible micro SD card that works as expected.  Now for filler text to get past the idiotic word count minimum.
4.0,"reasonable price, good quality. not much more needs to be said."
4.0,Installation on my Surface was simple and added a lot more storage to my tablet. I liked the SD adapter so that I can use it like a mini USB drive from my larger PC.
4.0,Very good and quality memory with good functions. I received it in record time from the seller and so far i have not had any issues with the memory card.
4.0,"Well i'm not a experienced product reviewer when it comes to such memory card kind of thing. Everything seems fine. Delivery time was on time. Writing speed reading speed is normal. I didn't expect adapter would come with it. That's plus 1 star. The only reason i'm giving four star is battery drain of my phone. When I filled this card with almost 15 GBs of music and put it in my phone, my phone's battery was draining very very quickly. Is it supposed to be like this? I'm not sure if it's phone's or this card's faulty. I.ve never been experienced such thing before. So if anyone knows the solution and explanation for this situation I hope U will enlighten me pls. Otherwise this product seems solid and legit."
4.0,Can't tel you much about it. Its a memory card and I can't compare it to other products out there.
4.0,"i just had an incident with my Galaxy S3 phone however where the chip became corrupt.. Is it the chip? Is it the phone?  I put one of these in my Samsung phone and another in my Samsung Tablet.  All is well except for that one time where the chip and phone got funny with each other and I had to erase all my music... The phone was able to format / erase / prepare the chip so it was immediately usable but I did lose my music.  Very weird.  Well, all I have to do is sync my music to my phone.. No big deal.."
4.0,It could just be my phone a Galaxy S3 but I have this MicroSD card in my phone and a 32 gb microcenter version in my wife's phone and the 32 th version benchmarks faster than this card. Not by much but it is slightly faster. Again this could just be my phone. One thing I do have a problem with is the fit of the microSD card in the holder/adapter. It is a very tight fit. If I put the card in a different holder/adapter it slides in and out with out problem. The one it came with really holds onto the card.
4.0,this works great on my Galaxy S4 right out of the box.and its faster then the old 32gb card i used to have.
4.0,Great storage for the price (&#60; $1 per GB). The only draw-back is that they are rather slow to write to.
4.0,Works perfectly and has enough storage for many hours of recording.Could be the best one out there for the price.Recommend this one.
4.0,"This is the largest capacity micro SDHD card that will work in theASUS MeMo Pad Smart ME301T-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16 GB Tablet (Blue). The card itself works great, but the adapter is defective. If I didn't already have another adapter, I would have to return this item."
4.0,"I've been using it for just over a week and so far I've had no issues...not that I was expecting any as I've used  SanDisk MicroSDHC cards before which have worked reliably. These have all been of  varying sizes under 32 GB, this being the largest  size I've ever used.  I've read complaints elsewhere from persons who've had problems with the said brand  which, fortunately, have been few."
4.0,"Do not buy this if speed is an issue. You want type 4 at least for speed, but this type 1 works great in my phone to just increase storage. I keep all my pictures on it and random files. I have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music."
4.0,"What can I say, it does what it's supposed to do. What I really like is the price, much much cheaper than what you pay at the best buy or radio shack.  Plus I got the card in less than 2 days without paying extra for 2nd day or overnight shipping."
4.0,"Stick this in the slot and forget about it.  Not sure what is being stored on this little thing or when I should remove it from my phone but, hey, it's in there."
4.0,"I would give these a 5th star if the memory  had consistent read/write times per card.I'm not saying they aren't fast,  but they all should stay within the rated speed they've been tested for, especially when in a USB 3.0 card  reader! After they have been used several times their speed decreases to below the threshold,  of the Standard set for these chips."
4.0,"Good quality SD memory. The speed suggested is true for the Read speed. The write speed is slower, around 15MB/s."
4.0,"Bought this for my Surface RT and it works just fine.  Also got it for $32, which was even better."
4.0,The only problem was in getting it to format to fat32 so that I could use it in myexcellent Sansa Clip+. I actually had to do a low level format and then reformat itto fat32 with  third party programs. It comes natively formatted to ex fat which many devices don't read (windows only formats fat32 to 32GB ). It's easy to format it to NTFS but either buy nothing bigger than 32GB or search the internet for programs and methods to reformat it if you need fat32 and you have the skill and time.Otherwise its good stuff but Scan-disk should provide a reformat program on their website imho?
4.0,"maybe the speed is not fast to beat others, but sandisk is always reliable. I have several sandisk SD/TF card, and they are never damaged. the data security is always very important."
4.0,"If you have one of the latest smartphones, go for this. I highly recommend this to take full advantage of the processing speed and fast computation need of our gadgets. Sandisk products are known for their quality and reliability. Of the couple of name brand flash products I use Sandisk gave me good ROI. Anything below will rob you of reliability."
4.0,A cheaper alternative than buying a tablet with more storage. Shipped promptly and the price was reasonable..I will probably purchase another.
4.0,"I bought a generic SD card for my Galaxy S5 and it corrupted all of my music. I am glad I have this SanDisk because it is faster at reading/writing and comes with the MemoryZone Backup app free, however, you need to have Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, or a similar cloud service. MemoryZone is great at backing up but lost some of my data when doing a transfer (phone to SD) :/"
4.0,"Transfer speeds are good, worth the price tag, use it in my samsung galaxy s3, sometimes it craps out and has to be reformatted or rebooted in phone. Otherwise no problems"
4.0,"it works, so far, waiting for the heat and cold to see how well it will hold up."
4.0,My fiance has had this in his tablet for almost a year now without a single issue. I feel that it's one of the best quality memory cards we've ever had. Make SURE you get the retail packaging and not the &#34;frustration-free.&#34; The retail packaging only requires one quick clip of the scissors and it's worth it to get one that is sealed in a package and not at risk to be damaged.
4.0,Well works just like any other SD card I don;t see ultra fast speeds or any thing. I shoved this guy into a Galaxy S4 and it works fine!
4.0,was a decent price for the amount of memory.  Had no issues reading it on my old HP6910P laptop built in card reader.  No problems so far.
4.0,"4 stars for the excellent price and performance. Seems to be as advertised. Average copying speeds are around 18-20MB/s.Only gripe is that SanDisk doesn't include any extras - i.e. a plastic protective case, or bundle it with a SD Card reader. However, can understand why at this price point."
4.0,"The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!"
4.0,"Use it (with the included adapter) as a spare card for my Panasonic FZ200 Lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my MacBook Pro laptop (which has a standard SD slot). Also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an iMac. Works exactly like a full-size SD card for these purposes. Very fast and reliable data transfers. And the special price from Amazon made these cards less costly than the standard 32 GB card at the time.UPDATE: I have changed the star rating from a 5 to a 4. This micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder. It still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop iMac. But often it will not mount in the laptop. This could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case, I will restore this to a 5-star rating."
4.0,"As the title says, it can cause your GoPro Hero 3 to stop recording mid recording if used at the highest resolutions and frame rates."
4.0,Tried this in my Gopro Silver camera. So for seems to work.Put card in Adapter to transfer files and had a very hard time removing it again. Will not try the adapter again with this card.
4.0,"First off, I've always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk's lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China."
4.0,"I was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule. That's always a plus in my book. The works without a hitch. I was able to copy the files from my 16GB card to this one relatively quickly and very easily. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 read the card perfectly. I have no complaints about the card although I expected the write speed to be a little faster. After all is said and done I would definitely recommend this card for your tablet, smart phone, or any other device that allows for expandable memory."
4.0,"Its probably better than I think it is. I got this to go in a Samsung tablet which is about to get replaced with an iPad. But the SD memory card portion has not given me any fits yet. The write speed isn't as high as some SD cards and this funky form factor requires an adapter most of the time, so don't expect to pop this into your DSLR."
4.0,"I had to replace the first one in my tablet! The first time I bought one of these for my tablet the disk became corrupted. I bought a replacement (this item,) and it seems to work just fine."
4.0,"What can I say, it's a memory card."
4.0,Installed in my tablet to expand memory.  Works very well for this application.  Recognized by the tablet and my desktop computer with no problems.
4.0,"I've used many others, and this is average. Its in my son's android, and I don't really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance.  Otherwise it does what i want it to.The adapter will come in handy later."
4.0,"works great with my GoPro camera, and had no problem using it in my computer, all the videos are recorded just fine and in good quality"
4.0,What can I say...it's a memory card.  Aren't they all the same?  No problems or issues with this product.  It works as described!
4.0,"I like this product as it works very well. At first it only showed but when I plugged my camera using this micro-sdhc into my laptop and seen that this card had 2 partitions on it, I had to chose the correct one to use, otherwise I couldn't take many pictures or videos."
4.0,Bought this for my Samsung Exhibit which has a small internal memory so I could move Google translate onto it. That did not work out since almost all apps wont transfer over to the memory card. But now I can take a ton of photos/videos and store music. No problem with it so far.
4.0,"I like my device to have enough storage so I finally purchased the 64GB version. Formatted the card and haven't fun into any kind of problem. Inserted it into my Samsun Galaxy 8 tablet, now it's complete."
4.0,"decent size card, that performs well with my hero 3.  shot video at 720p had no issues.  not much more to say than it works."
4.0,"It works great, good size good  and good price. Only giving it 4 stars because it is a &#34;little&#34; slow to write and read from but it is to be expected from an XC card with speeds up to 10mb/s I believe."
4.0,I wanted a micro SD card for a camera I purchased and this fit the bill at a reasonable price.Fit right in and works well
4.0,"I purchased this to go into an external wireless connect drive that is made by the same manufacturer. Other than having to format it differently than the default (a very simple process), I have not experienced any issues with it."
4.0,"Comes with the SD card converter, good size for camera memory it reduces your need to change it so often."
4.0,"UPDATE:I raised my star rating on this from 1 to 4 because of the customer service.  I was able to get a replacement pretty easily.  Hopefully it will last longer!ORIGINAL REVIEW:This item worked well while it lasted.  I bought it in October 2012 for my tablet pc and then for an android smartphone.  I did not make many transfers to the card, it was mostly reading files from it.  Now it is March 2013 and suddenly the card is no longer recognized in my android phone.  It is no longer recognized on my other devices as well.  I lost many photos and videos on the card because of it.  I'm sure Sandisk will exchange it for a new one, but this shouldn't be happening with a card that is less than a year old."
4.0,The SanDisk Ultras tend to work reliably on all my different cameras and phones which is not always true of some common but less expensive cards. This simplifies ordering but they do cost a bit more.
4.0,"I bought my stepdaughter a Galaxy phone, and I didnt want to spend the extra money to upgrade her phone from 16gb. This was cheap and works fine."
4.0,"I have nothing bad to say about this product. the packaging indicated that it was new, never tampered with. it came in the mail on time and I have had no issues with the card overheating like some other reviews have mentioned. I like that fact that now I have 16GB of space and this means I can have more pictures and home movies on my phone to share. Also music for when I'm working out. Great buy and for the price I really like it. I recommend it and will be buying one more for another phone."
4.0,I find San Disk always to be a good choice for storage options. Capacity and performance are always top notch.
4.0,Slow compared to some usb drives. The good is it is small and will hold large files. I would recommend this product for cell phone only use. Not to be used as a back up usb memory drive for Nexus 7. I would use a high speed USB drive for the Nexus 7.
4.0,A well made replacement part for use with my system.  Reads and writes quickly to my camera.  The down side:  I do not like the size of this card.  Very tiny and often difficult to remove from my Canon camera.  Not a reflection on the San Disk card quality but the industry move into micro-miniture cards.  I won't buy another camera using micro SD cards.
4.0,"Using in a Surface Pro's microSD slot.  I even reformatted to NTFS (which they claim is not recommended) in order to set up a virtual disk file on it and 'automount' that virtual disk upon startup so that my music library can be on this (Win 8 is kind of picky about letting you set up what it considers 'removable' volumes as directories to be auto-scanned for libraries, and this is one workaround.)Amazing to me that something the size of my pinky nail can hold my entire music collection at a nice high bitrate, and still have much more room left over.  One star off because its a tiny bit slow to write to but that might not be fair since I'm comparing to full-size SD and I did reformat, as I said."
4.0,"This is the second card I've purchased of this exact model.  The first one I had went bad after about 8 months.  To be fair, I had it in a rooted Galaxy S3 with CM10.1 loaded on it.  So it's possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the card.I'm back on the stock rom now due to issues with 4G LTE.  I'm not even rooted anymore.  So I'm hoping that the card remains solid this time.  Everyone else seems to love it so I'm hoping serves me well for a long time.So far... So good..."
4.0,The stock memory card that came with my Motorola Defy-XT was only 4 GB and I wanted to up the memory. This works quite well and was a good buy for the class 10 card.
4.0,Works great for the month I have had it in my Galaxy S3.  I purchased this to go in my Samsung Galaxy S 3 and was super excited I didn't need to buck up more money for the 32GB phone.  Well *dumb* me did not know the the SG3 does not allow apps to be moved to an external SD card.  I thouhgt I had researched everything but I missed that.  The card works fin and I can store umpteen thousand pictures not that I have figured out how and I might even be able to figure out how to put a movie onto it but what a waste of a GREAT SD card.Pro: Top of the line cardCon: SSG3 and most new smartphones won't allow apps to sd even with the micro sd card option on the phone
4.0,"Got the card, took it out of the package, dropped it in my Samsung S4, rebooted and it detected it immediately.  No need to format or anything.  Haven't done any speed tests, but I haven't noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them, either."
4.0,"Worked as expected in both my Blackberry Z10 and my HP laptop and is plenty fast - writes at around 9.5MB/sec, but reads so far on my PC that I can't get an accurate number for the speed. I gave it four stars because the write speed falls a touch short of the Class 10 rating - it's honestly not enough to be an issue for me, but people who need the speed in a camera might be slightly disappointed. However, the capacity and price more than make up for that in my mind.Also, makes a great store for content in my Blackberry!"
4.0,"Got it for my new Galaxy S3 and it works like a charm. Super fast speed of transfer. Very much recommend it. Not much else to say really... except store it securely! D: You don't want to lose such a tiny thing. Comes with an SD adapter, but no case, like the SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Card I got, hence the four stars."
4.0,"I would like to give 5, but only adapter is bad on this. with adapter data transfer rate is very slow. That's why i gave less rating."
4.0,I have used this with Sony camcorder for more than a year now. It works well and copes with the high data volume of a camcorder video.
4.0,Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter which i believe will let you use it on your Wii or 3DS.
4.0,"Had this item for a week or so now and it seems to be working fine. I haven't put it through any kind of stress or anything, just stuck it in my phone and let it do it's thing. So far, so good."
4.0,"There are a number of MicroSD manufacturers out there that offer large capacity cards like this. They claim to be Class 10 but when tested, prove to be closer to Class 6 cards in performance. This SanDisk card performs at the Class 10 level.I use these cards in various devices that NEED Class 10 speeds, such as my Android phone because of the data transfers I do for work and for the games I keep on it.If your device does not need Class 10 (you are just using it for simple storage of basic files like docs or ebooks) then you could probably save some money by going with Class 6. If the prices are very close, then you might as well spend the extra money and get Class 10.This card came with a nice plastic storage case and a SD adapter. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I feel the prices should be a lot lower by now. Inventory is plentiful and these are not cutting edge tech any more."
4.0,"My only gripe is I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you never need something like this when it's on sale."
4.0,"Works with my Nikon D3200 camera and also my HP laptop, but for some reason my friend's laptop (Dell) would refuse to recognize it/acknowledge its existence. Not sure if it was the card, the adapter, the computer, the port, or what. Card should work fine for anything, I think."
4.0,"I have 4 of these in use in different devices.  I have had no issues with any of these cards, they're all still working great."
4.0,"Fast card, reliable performance.  Got this card for my Galaxy S3, no compatibility issues.  Would buy again for in a heart beat."
4.0,The card works with a Galaxy Note 2.  Install was simple.There are some minor drawbacks I was unaware of when using card storage on my phone.I do notice an initial lag when first accessing the card.Transferring existing items onto card storage is not that simple.Not all items can be moved to card storage.
4.0,"This card is great. Ive noticed slight improvement in every aspect of my phone. So much space! Very pleased. Came on time. Brand new. Easy to open thanks to Amazon. And it mentions on the tiny booklet that this thing is temperature resistant. Thats a big plus since overuse of smartphones tend to heat em up pretty good. Being from Texas, the heat out here only makes em hotter. And my last SD seems to have fried. Well this is a good buy. If i need another i'd definitly buy again. Maybe the black and gold one. It only available in 16GB but its super fast."
4.0,Good SD card and works fine with adapter.  Satisfied with purchase of this product.  Can fill it quickly though with HD video.
4.0,So far haven't got any issues. I'm using it to record video with my GoPro and it works fine. I'm also considering buying another one for my cellphone :-)
4.0,"Reliable, no comments, it is a well know brand. I use it for my dash cam, the problem I have is with the dash cam (cheap Chinese)."
4.0,"the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems."
4.0,I have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren't ideal. I bought a 16gb galaxy s 3 and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the 32gb Microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when I didn't do anything.
4.0,"SANDISK is now processing my RMA.  It was used in my Galaxy Note 2.  Its been over a week since I mailed it out. Fortunately they paid for shipping, but while it was working, it was awesome.. 64 gigabytes of class 10 accessible data, at the hands of your finger tips, literally MICRO SD sized.  wow, how technology has improved."
4.0,"It's an sd card, this one's fast. The read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one. Approaching 20mbits per second for read and write. I installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard. Yeah, read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer.Sandisk makes nice stuff don't they?"
4.0,The SD slot on my laptop recognized this card immediately.  When I put it in my Droid Razr Maxx it recognized the proper amount but the phone required a reformat.Since install my phone has had some instability but I haven't had enough time to troubleshoot to determine whether or not it is due to the card.  Motorola says the phone can handle 32gig cards.  Some users have reported the 64gig works fine. Other users have reported problems with the 64gig card. Other than the phone instability the storage on the card seems to be working fine for now.
4.0,Good item came well packaged and been working fine so far only thing is it will not connected when using the adapter when connecting it to My PC.
4.0,"i bought this for only one use, to put in my samsung galaxy s3. i popped in the card, mounted and formatted in settings, and it works like a charm in the phone. HOWEVER(it's in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer's frontal bay and it wouldn't even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i'm not quite sure what's going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it's in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you're using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i'm giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you're getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine"
4.0,"I own a first generation Microsoft Surface Pro 128, and it has been a good machine but I was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of 128GB of storage space. I had a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card, which worked well but was not going to fit the VMWare virtual machine I wanted to run off the SD storage. The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I've actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review. It provides its main selling point, more storage at a relatively low cost, so far has run reliably in my tablet computer.If storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128GB SDXC, then I would recommend product."
4.0,"The card works well. Purchased 64 GB to use in my phone as that will store a lot of pix and tunes! Ah, but the phone does not recognize the 64, and I can only use about half the memory."
4.0,Good card for the price.  Lots of room for music  Plays in the Sansa MP3 without any difficulty or trouble
4.0,"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own."
4.0,I have this installed in my BlackBerry Z10. I have the camera on my phone set to store directly to this little card. It's really a great feeling to take photos all day long and not worry about filling the card up. I really recommend it if you have a phone that allows for external memory expansion. Sorry iPhone users.
4.0,"Never had a problem with any sd cards prior, and always had a good track record with sandisk products.Card was working great at first, used exclusively in my Samsung galaxy S3. Enjoyed the extra space(got the 32gb card) and transfers were pretty quick. I started to see (about a month ago) that the phone would randomly give me ""sd card unexpectedly removed"" error maybe once a week. The last 2 weeks, I also started seeing (frequently) ""sd card safe to remove"" randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the ""unexpected"" removal error every few days. Today the card stopped reading all together.The card was first inserted w/ the phone off, when I bought it. Although I never formatted it, it worked properly. I also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal, so the card just seems to have died of it's own accord. I never thought to check it's temperature after transferring large files so I'm not sure if I had the same issue as another reviewer.Contacted Sandisk, waiting for reply. If they replace the card and it works well, I will revise this review.UPDATE: 2-28-13got a replacement card after about a week and a half, Sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus. I've had the replacement in my S3 for 3.5 months now and still going strong. I've also used it with the adapter in my goPro. Card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so. Updated to 4 stars since I haven't had a single problem with this card (the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing). Maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there."
4.0,Not much to say..bought it to use with my smartphone. It works as expected and allowed me to free up my internal memory.
4.0,Used primarily as a portable hard-drive (content back-up and file transfers).  Working well for this application.I have this attached to a small key-chain USB adapter and really like the compact nature of the microSD card
4.0,"Got this card in early January for my Samsung Tab2 10.1 tablet.  Within a couple of weeks, it was loading music files incorrectly onto the card.  I did not know what was wrong, but finally thought I would format card again to see if that would correct the problem.  Card would not quick format or format slowly.  As always, Amazon is taking care of the problem and I will have replacement card within 24 hours!  Hope the replacement is more reliable.  I am just writing it off as a fluke, as I have never had a problem with a SanDisk product in the past.2/14/13:  When I called Amazon they replaced it - to my door - within 24 hours!  Replacement works fine.  Now that is GREAT service!"
4.0,"Comes with an SD card adapter.  Not much I can say about an SD card, but I would recommend it for the price!"
4.0,"It's just what I needed, it works fine, and I got it around Christmas time at a great sale price."
4.0,"Its a memory card that simply worked when I plugged it in. Not the fastest, but not the most expensive."
4.0,Bought this for my girlfriend.The card works very nice and is a great way to up your storage on your cell phone.this is currently in a Samsung Galaxy S4.
4.0,Another necessity for the Go-Pro's that I feel should at least come with the Go-Pro's. At least a smaller GB to get you recording right out of the box. Too afraid to purchase an off-brand in fear of it not being compatible with the camera.
4.0,Excellent product for my new Galaxy S4 phone. On-board storage has now been increased 4-fold! Would definitely recommend this product.
4.0,Good price on this big micro SD card. Works with my Samsung Galaxy S5 great.
4.0,"shipped quickly, plug and play just like it says, and I haven't noticed any bottlenecking on my phone due to slow speeds."
4.0,"The first one I received kept unmounting from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It was a new phone so I wasn't sure if the problem was the memory card or the phone, but I sent the card back for a replacement and the second one has worked fine.  Just under 6000 songs loaded uses just over half the space.  Love that!"
4.0,"The price was great.  Since this is an SDXC Class 10 card,I expected pretty decent write speeds.  I copied about 30GB of data from my computer HD to this card and it took over 8 hours.Of course, since that was a one-time thing, I didn't really mind.  It works great in my Microsoft Surface Pro.  I just cannot believe that I could find a 64GB micro SDXC card for under $50.  The sale is over, of course, and I've not been able to find them this cheap since.I would buy another one if it were comparably priced."
4.0,It's an SD card.  No one has the tools to test whether this is a Class 10 with speeds of blah blah blah.  It works and that is all that matters.
4.0,The first unit I received had the dreaded defect where it would disconnect then reconnect which was super annoying. SanDisk has a very nice online warranty software in place and since it was a known issue they were speedy with a replacement. The new unit works perfectly and provides plenty of space. As a manufacture it was nice to be treated as I treat my customers from such a larger company.
4.0,"it is good memory card, it is working fine until now. i am using it in my Galaxy S3 just for storing the pictures which i take, so i do not know if it will come up with issues later on"
4.0,I put this into an old Samsung table that my kids use and it seems to work well. We have some videos on this card as well as a large number of apps. I have not had any problems.
4.0,Works well working as designed... Fast and Furious. I'm using in my Samsung Galaxy 4S and loving it. Have music and photos on it and the access time in the photo gallery very quick.
4.0,"At the time of writing this review I bought three of these memory cards in last couple of weeks, for work related phones. They work fine in the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini phones. We are happy with the read and write speeds. One small note of caution the price that can be paid for these can vary, so please check around and save a few extra dollars. When installed you will not get the full 32Gb from the SD card - but that is to be expected, so please bear this mind."
4.0,"This card is used for my Samsung Galaxy S3 on AT&T and it works great!  Read and write speeds are pretty good, and the card installed and was recognized by the phone very easily.  Great option if you need more storage on your mobile device!"
4.0,"Bought 2 for me and my wife Samsung Galaxy S2 phones.  Took photos and video and there is no issues at all.  Based on my previous experience on similar products I got for DSLR and other cameras,  this thing should last as long as or longer than all my electronics."
4.0,"It's pretty much a commodity product made in the Far East, but what I store on it is pretty valuable.  I feel confident in SanDisk manufacturing quality control, in the end."
4.0,Works fine with photo shooting and video recording in EOS camera with the SD adapter. Perfect for tablet and phone memory.
4.0,"Sometimes when the price is too low you get less than you paid for. My suspicions were deepened when the package arrived with generic packaging, not the brand label of &#34;SanDisk Ultra.&#34; Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the product. It works fine. Sure beats the price Walmart was charging for a 64 GB micro SD card."
4.0,"Its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail.  I have this mounted to my phone filled with music, documents, pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past 3 phones.  Still have plenty of room left and no issues."
4.0,Always have multiple shots at your dataI lost some photos due to a corrupt cardI used this for my phoneThe company did replace my card with no problemsBeen working great for the past few months
4.0,"Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone's internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems."
4.0,"Storage prices will always go down (though I won't say at what rate over what interval of time, a la Moore's Law - I'm not that smart.) At the time I purchased it, it was a very good price for this amount of memory.  In a year's time, it will probably be a laughably expensive sum for a pittance of storage.  Oh, well.With it in my phone, I don't have to worry about the number of photos or the duration of video I take."
4.0,"There is a speed penalty if exfat is used as oppose to NTFS.Using ATTO and formatted as exfat:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~15MBsUsing ATTO and formatted as NTFS:read speed = ~45MBswrite speed = ~17MBsWith exfat, the write speed actually fluctuates as the transfer size increases.  But using NTFS, the speed are consistent.Tested on Lenovo T530 using built in SD card reader."
4.0,"Worked immediately after I inserted.29.71 GB recognized, doesn't really bug me but I wish I got the full 32."
4.0,I use these in my Logitech Alert cameras which are outside in the elements. These perform better and more importantly last longer than other cards do.
4.0,"Using this in my Samsung G3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion. it works ok for now, allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity. I hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes. I have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card. or any other error messages. Overall minus the slight issues it works great."
4.0,I bought a new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone and needed an expansion card to boost up the memory for photos and music.  This is the cheapest 32Gb card I could find.  Works well.
4.0,This does not lock in perfectly into a Surface 2. It locks in but you have to force it. Other than that it gives you about 59gb once installed.
4.0,Had to give it 4 stars because when formatted it only provides 28GB.  Not as clean as I would have expected a SanDisk product to be.  Especially a Class 10 product.
4.0,I just installed it and working OK so far
4.0,"Great Card but poor packaging don't understand why these manufactures seem to think that putting all this plastic wrap all over the cards is good, anyway the card is high quality sturdy and quick to save and pull information from on my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3"
4.0,"I was really excited to get this because I hadn't changed my MicroSD card in my phone since I got the original droid.  I was so excited to see how much faster the write/read speeds would be.It worked great at first but then my phone started to tell me that it was unrecognizable and it kept ejecting it. I thought maybe it was a formatting issue so I reformatted it from my phone (Galaxy S4) but it just did the same thing.After a week of this I was very irritated and decided to give up and just return it and get another one. I was scared that it would do the same thing because many other people had issues with these cards in the galaxy's.To my surprise the new 32GB card that amazon sent back to me has been working great where as the other one would have been ejecting every other hour.I am really happy with amazon and their return policy. It was very fast and easy, I can honestly say I've never returned something so fast and so easy, they literally sent it next day delivery and at no cost to me.The only reason I gave it one star off is because I had to return the first one, other than that the product has been great so farI am extremely happy with amazon's service.As far as the SD card I'd definitely get another one if it worked like the one I have now."
4.0,"So far it has worked very well, stores more that I need which is a great feature. Another nice feature is the red paint, really, I drop these little cards and the all black version are often hard to find, the red is easy to spot, now if it only glowed in the dark..lol"
4.0,"There are plenty of these on the market, but SanDIsk is a brand I trust, great size, and a really good value."
4.0,I got this SD card for my android tablet. My only complaint is after the tablet installed its file system my computers would no longer recognize the SD card. Still love it.
4.0,"this item works great but maybe a better price would be better, I use it on my phones works great"
4.0,For this capacity and price you can't go wrong.  I'm not sure what class this is but they recommend higher class for video. I would recommend this product. Good luck
4.0,"I installed this card in a Nook Tablet and attempted to transfer videos to the card from my Windows xp computer - - some transferred okay, others not. Thinking the card was defective I bought another one (same card type) and installed it with the same result. I have had no problems transferring videos to this card from my Windows 7 computer."
4.0,with the black friday discount the price is great. i got free shipping by bundling other items to meet (over $35) free shipping. comes in sandisk package so it is nice to know it is not a black market knockoff. i bought 2 of these babies.
4.0,"A fine product.  I've been using mine for over a year now, and it's never punked out on me.  I just bought another one, to use as a spare.  Delivered on time, reliable, priced fairly."
4.0,"You need to format this card to FAT32 before using it in your cell phone, otherwise it will not work. My Samsung Galaxy S3 kept giving me beef until I did so. It's handy to have a laptop sitting around that has a port that can take this card with its adapter in.Luckily I had one such laptop lying around. Otherwise, this card works great and holds quite a bit of space. Giving it 4 stars for the initial grief with formatting it. IIRC I used a tool called Fat32 Format, but it's on my laptop so I haven't checked."
4.0,"I bought this because I needed more storage for Asus TF700T tablet and this was the largest capacity microSD card I could find. Card came preformated with the exFAT file system which is recognized by the Asus TF700T tablet and many other Android devices. The only reason I take a star off is because I can't attain transfer speeds anywhere near the 30 MB/s that SanDisk claims (I averaged around 8 MB/s which is fine for utilizing media on the tablet, but made the initial transfer of 30GB of files onto the card a slow process)."
4.0,"Using the card for videos and music, have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media!"
4.0,"Purchase this for my asus tablet, read and write times are excellent, no problems so far.  came with case and adapter.  good price."
4.0,"works great, i trust SanDisk for quality.  I would recommend this sd card to anyone who is looking for a large storage card for videos."
4.0,THE SANDISK ULTRS 64 GB MICROSDXC CLASS 10 UHS-1 MEMORY CARD WORK GOOD IN MY ATIV SMART 500T SAMSUNG WITH ADAPTER
4.0,Bought it as addition to my tablet Samsung Note 10.1 edition 2014. IS great for storing pictures and....... Very good at a reasonable price.
4.0,"After extensive review / research I wanted the best 64gb available to improve/increase memory for Samsung tab 3 7.0 many cards out there but this one loaded up quickly and appears to be ready for add on apps and preserving meory storage. The price was right, delivered quickly even with holiday, loaded and was quickly loaded/compatible with Samsung tab 3 7.0. Sandisk actually has a use chart that will show shopper what card to use for their device. Very helpful"
4.0,the transfer speed is good the picture quality is good it was shipped to me well packed but not over taped up
4.0,This is the first of these I've had.  It works as mentioned and have had not problems with it.  Satisfied.
4.0,No problem here. I use it in my Samsung Note 10.1. It is a little slow writing to it but such are micro SD cards.
4.0,It worked for a GoPro so what more to say except I wonder how they can fit 64 gigs on such a small chip. Amazing.
4.0,So far this sandisk ultra is working ok.I ran a few tests on it from within my phone before i began using it and the speed was well within reason.it does not read and write at the same speed.so far so good i guess
4.0,"This is a class 10 microSD card, and it works just as advertised. It's very fast- good for recording HD video and such. It's pretty decently priced per gig for a card of its class.However, beware that adapter that comes with it! Put the card in, good luck getting it back out. I made the mistake of doing this to test the memory on my laptop, and actually had to resort to pliers to pull them out, which is probably not a great way to keep the chip in tip-top shape. Note I also said 'them' there- I got two of these and they were both that way, so I doubt it was just a manufacturing defect.Buy the memory, throw away the adapters. Seriously, they are dangerous to use and for all intents and purposes convert it into a standard SD card permanently.Pro:ReliableFastGood priceCon:Adapter: It's a trap!"
4.0,"I bought three of these cards. One died one day (in my Galaxy S3) after about a month and a half of use. The phone said the card was removed unexpectedly, and it never functioned again. The phone still recognized all other cards. I contacted SanDisk, and they shipped out a replacement under warranty.The cards have served me well. Two are in Galaxy S3's, and another in a Galaxy Note II. Copying to them is decently fast, and they are great for music or video storage. Phones have no problem playing 720p video off the cards."
4.0,"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!"
