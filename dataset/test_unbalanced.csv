1.0,Tablet broke in the case.
1.0,"This is one of those basic items that usually just work. In my case, I received one that just did not work. A couple of weeks ago, my phone reported an error and so I reformatted the card and transferred my music back onto it. Unfortunately it failed again two days ago and it won't even format now. I have had good luck with SanDisk before, but this one was not a good experience."
1.0,Horrible!!! Stopped working at 9 mos.. Do not buy
1.0,I should have known better. Everyone is complaining about this memory card if you read reviews on specialized forums. Last time I buy anything from Sandisk.
1.0,"I made a purchase of a SanDisk Cruzer Blade 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive and up to now I realize that their capacity is less than 1GB, please I require help, whether it was a mistake or damaged pen drive wine"
1.0,"I purchase it on July 26/2015, as soon as I connect to my computer it got installed, follow all the instruction, mess with it for over an hour and finally gave up, couldn't make it work, today is Aug 30/2015, try to return it, but expiration date to return was Aug27, not happy with the product, instruction on the box can miss lead you easily, I'll be careful next time ordering anything from Amazon! not happy at all"
1.0,Just got this today. First i noticed that it come with 2 usb ports one you have to use to plug it up so you only really get one extra. Also set up on my laptop and started running it for like 20minutes then laptop crashed. I have HP dv7. Where it vents from the corner and theres really no fan in the corner. Maybe my 17inch laptop is 2 big but the only thing i liked about it is its quiet and clips that keep your laptop in one place.
1.0,"The plastic that holds the iPad in place started to break after four weeks.  Surprising, because the case never got damaged, or dropped.  I would suggest people to buy something else"
1.0,Drive is slower than SSDs purchased nearly 4 years ago.
1.0,"This is frustrating. I bought this sky wifi smartpen and very dissapointed because it is not working. I live in Istanbul and if I send it back to USA for a replacement, sending it is also quite a lot cost and waste of money and waste of time. I heard that the company charges $49 for a replacement and,that means this pen will cost me almost $300 rather than $200 (also adding the shipment cost) even that it is not my fault. My pen was brand new and seeing it not working after unpacking my product is very very dissapointing. Never used and it seems like I purchased a defected device, which is not working at all. No lights, no sounds, nothing... I searched internet for a solution and found out that I'm not the only one. There are many many buyers complaining about the same problem. This pen is a total dissapointment."
1.0,My tablet screen cracked because of the case the pen cracked it
1.0,Terrible product! My daughter received it as a gift and the battery keeps dying and there is no storage to speak of.  Spend a bit more and buy an iPad.
1.0,Buyer beware card unreadable from the get go. Luck for me amazon helped me out. There are many others on here that know how to format to Fat32 threw Window 7 and have had same issues.
1.0,"Absolute junk. Poor image quality. Flimsy construction. (It fell apart in my hands taking it out of the box.) The method for updating firmware is a joke. It does NOT connect with the Amcrest NVR that Foscam sells, even though Foscam tells you it does. (Amcrest tech support told me they have LOTS of problems with Foscam cameras, ESPECIALLY THE C1.) If you for some reason decide to purchase this garbage, put Foscam's tech support phone number in your speed dial-you're gonna need it.<br />AVOID-AVOID-AVOID!!!!"
1.0,"I guess I should be happy it failed after only 1 month, because I only lost 1 month's worth of pictures etc.  I bought 3 of these cards for my wife, son and I.  My wife's had a minor glitch, which went away with a reboot.  Mine had a minor glitch this morning, so I expected the reboot to fix it.  No a reboot caused my Motorola Defy XT to tell me the card was blank and needed to be formatted.  My laptop won't even recognize the card when I put the card in it's reader.  After a couple hours of looking for a way to fix it, I have only found that this is very common for this specific card.EDIT: I was very happy with Sandisk after calling them.  They did say there are compatibility issues with CLASS 10 cards and some of the Android phones, and verified my phone is one of them.  They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.  These are the reasons we buy sandisk in the first place.  They did recommend a Class 4 or lower card to me for this phone.I am leaving this as a 1 star, because people should be aware of compatibility issues this severe.2nd Edit:  As of March 12, this replacement card, that wasn't going to ""be susceptible to the same type of failure"" is losing apps etc.  I am giving this card up.  It has taken my phone and turned it into a device I cannot count on."
1.0,I wish I had returned it. I've had wired versions of this mouse I've used for over ten years. LOVE IT. However this one never tracks correctly. I've tried gaming mouse pads and different placements of the usb connector. Nothing helps. It sucks. REALLY WISH I HAD THE CORDED VERSION. =(
1.0,It fractured after 1 month
1.0,"This thing might be OK, but unbelievably, it can not be set up to boot when power is applied.  Someone has to press and hold the power button for several seconds each time it's powered up.  This makes it useless for Kiosk work, which is a role that it would be perfect for otherwise.  I've never heard of a computer that didn't have a &#34;Boot when power applied&#34; option in the BIOS.  This is a bizarre and severe limitation."
1.0,I does NOT fit correctly in my phone.  Because of that it doesn't even register that it's in my phone.
1.0,hand worked anything I plugged it in.
1.0,"I bought this for my Android phone and it kept stating ""media scanning"" over and over, even when the device was on or not even restarted. I thought it was the phone and was so annoyed. Then did a search and found that several others got a duds from this same batch off amazon. So not only did I pay for this, now I have a useless 32gb card that refuses to hold music on my phone, or anywhere else. I loaded a 4gb card in the same device and it only scans media when restarted and does not lag at all. The phone can hold up to 32 gb too. If you don't believe me, go onto the Sandisk message boards and look. It's a dud. So disappointing."
1.0,"Loved the price  but not durable at all, back broke off in one week (normal use) didn't drop or used inappropriately.  Case fits good, and iPad is protected just missing back arm."
1.0,Bought hoping to use all 10 ft of the cord. All 3 have stopped working because the Lightning plug part wore out from being bent around a lot. To fragile to be used. Better luck just buyin and extension cord with a 3' charging cable if you want use it far from an outlet
1.0,"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card."
1.0,When my iPhone 6 is plugged in using this charger the phone starts randomly changing screens and does not respond correctly when I try to type on it.
1.0,Overheats in minutes. Lasted 3 days.
1.0,Dosent work for Xbox like it says it does
1.0,Worse reception than my Belkin n100 router I had. Returned it. Good interface but poor range
1.0,"It appears that the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Micro SD Card I purchased from Amazon was defective.  I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.  I'm still using the old 8GB card without a hiccup.The good thing was that Amazon's return policy was quick and painless."
1.0,"all 3 does't work , come with connectivity problem"
1.0,They stopped charging after a week
1.0,"When attempting to play a blu-ray dvd, the drive ejects itself and re-connects itself to my computer continuously until I give up. Very very poor product."
1.0,Until it broke it was great then send it in to get repaired and now it's very very slow and there's voices in the background which I have no idea to get rid of
1.0,Works 30% of the time.  iPad stops charging with a &#34;Device not supported&#34; error.
1.0,"The style shown is a Kingston DTSE9 USB Flash Drive, but genuine DTSE9 drives are only made to a maximum capacity of 128GB.  See &#34;http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTSE9H_us.pdf&#34; for Kingston DTSE9 product specifications and check for yourself.  In fact, *nobody* currently makes true 2TB USB flash drives. The top capacity on the market is the 1TB Kingston Predator.<br /><br />Any DTSE9 advertised with a higher capacity is a Chinese counterfeit. These counterfeits invariably also have fake capacity. That is why their price is so low.  You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.se drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves.

1.0,"It did not work at all, it was a dud, and I was unable to return it."
1.0,"Showed up under search for &#34;portable blu-ray player&#34;  but is actually a blu-ray disc/recording device.  Had purchased this for grandchild to watch movies in the car, but there is no screen and it is not portable - must be plugged into a PC.  I have returned it."
1.0,Some keys stopped working on the qwerty row of the keyboard a few days after I received this product.
1.0,"After 32 days of use, conveniently just after the return window, the space bar stopped working, rendering it useless.  Do not recommend."
1.0,Very sad the mouse pad has a mind of its own since day one. I had a different keyboard that looks similar and actually cheaper which worked fine. This one is disappointing.
1.0,Came with a blown speaker replaced it and new one came with a blown speaker as well buy from razor instead
1.0,I ordered this on the 19th and was satisfied with the quick shipping only to be disappointed by the product itself. The product itself was too large to fit in the laptop to charge.
1.0,Although while it worked it worked we loved it. I am very disappointed that the warranty is only for a year and a year and one week after I bought this for my son we ended up with a black screen and were unable to get the issue resolved and were offered a &#34;deal&#34; on a new one. I passed... if they don't last more than a week after the warranty without any options to fix it I will go with a different product.
1.0,"I have RCN in Chicago. Currently they are upgrading everyone to 110Mbps at the same monthly price as 50Mbps... PLUS they are requiring this equipment. Wired downloads are 100Mbps+, which is great. Wireless cannot get above 40Mbps. The tech specs claim that this modem is capable of 3x3 wireless (aka 450Mbps download over wifi)... but that is not possible with the current firmware, which RCN will NOT allow to be upgraded. I was getting faster Wifi with a 50Mbps provider speed and a cheaper router."
1.0,"Don't buy this laptop, it's good at first but after 3 days of having it problems started popping up. First connection kept getting disconnected and 2days after that, the &#34;BSOD&#34; Driver Power State Failure kept happening every 30 minutes. I'm just here to help you save your time and money."
1.0,"HUGE disappointment. Battery life horrible, even reading books.  Hard to connect to internet even sitting directly in front of a modem.  Wish I had spent the extra money on Ipad mini.  Will not recommend this product to anyone."
1.0,"Don't waste your money on this! I have had nothing but problems with this laptop! It freezes up, it shuts down and takes away all my desktop setting randomly (the background picture and custom color) I have to manually clear the cache every few weeks or the internet is so slow that it takes a while to even type something out! Speaking of internet... the only browser it will run properly is Explorer. It barely functions after running Netflix or Photoshop even if you exit out of them... and I find the touchscreen pointless. That is a feature I just don't use.<br /><br />Buy a different laptop, because this one is not worth the money! I would give it a zero rating if I could."
1.0,"Gave this item as a gift this week, just past the 30-day return window. When my son opened the package the tablet was DOA. It would not charge. Would not power on. We tried other micro USB chargers, to no avail. I believe DEAL CHASER should either replace this item or refund my money."
1.0,"Battery did not work,  I return it"
1.0,The charger on this tablet is very loose and almost impossible to use
1.0,Not user friendly at all.  Have brought earlier models which I liked.
1.0,Product stopped working after a day. Worst waste of money ever
1.0,doesn't fit at all
1.0,No option to give below this. I thought that the Battery had gone in just 20 uses in 2 months.. can't believe. Was very slow too. No customer service.. Worst. Can't even be repaired since it's totally gone.. seems like mother board died within 2 months.. How can I get my money back ?
1.0,O.K
1.0,Worked great the first few weeks but will no longer turn on.  Its 3 days before the cut off of not being able to return it any longer.
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE.  I've had to replace it 3x, and on the 4th replacement I gave up and just took their 80% refund.  That's right, they would not refund 100% when the Kindle never worked properly.<br /><br />Now let me tell you about how I used it... I used it to repeat ONE song to put my kids to sleep.  It only repeated an ocean waves/white noise song.  Over and over, it's only task.  Three different kindles, all ended up frozen on either the AMAZON screen or the FIRE screen.<br /><br />They were very kind to send replacements.  Sure they came quickly but they all froze doing the same task even w/ different song files.  Save yourself the money and the headache of continually replacing this thing.  I plan on using my 80% refund on buying a real white noise machine which I know will not freeze."
1.0,No appreciable increase in signal strength
1.0,"forget loading this into your cart.  a one day pause and this junk went up 16.99, in ONE DAY.  I don't give money to aXXholes."
1.0,"Apparently I know 2 people including myself who have received defective units and also returned it. My provider, Cox, blamed it on the modem since once they replaced it with a different modem, the service was working fine and smoothly."
1.0,Broken sent back
1.0,Macbook Pro stopped recognizing drive. Lost CD inside because of &#34;no eject button&#34; Very noisy while running. Sent back for refund. Do not buy this drive.
1.0,"I have used this cable about once a month since I received it. A little over one year after purchasing, it does not work anymore. Disappointed."
1.0,This has got to be one of the worse controllers I've came across in years. I got this one from Gamestop and within a week the right thumb stick got stuck in the up position. It looks like a spring must have broken in it. Best to get the sony version while they still make them because this is  some shhhhh it!
1.0,"I routinely use SDXC cards up to 128GB, and this card was unreadable on arrival.  Both of my PCs said it needed to be formatted, and as a last resort I let one of them try (Windows 7/i7with up-to-date SDXC drivers), and it could not format it.  It's on its way back to Amazon.  I'm glad their returns are so easy!"
1.0,"Contrary to the description, this does NOT fit a Toshiba L750 Satellite laptop."
1.0,"bad, I never worked, has bug in the software"
1.0,"It lasted me about 3 months, now it's a paperweight. It's not worth the small amount of money, spend a few more dollars and buy a decent battery."
1.0,Just image we bought this piece of junk hoping to get our monies worth. It worked for eight months and crashed!!! The warranty for this product was approxiamately 1 to 2 months. That says a lot about this product. Good luck to those people who bought this product and it went beyond eight months. Amazon labeled this product as new! The customer service label or sticker found below the laptop was tampered with. Nice one Amazon.
1.0,"I purchased 2 of these, hoping at least 1 would work.  Wishful thinking on my part...  Both quit responding as I downloaded files to them, and could no longer be recognized by WIN7.  Windows offered the option of formatting the drives - at a maximum of 32GB.  This is a total scam..."
1.0,"Cable barely works, only charges my phone like half the time"
1.0,"My Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD works fine with a 16GB SanDisk card, but the 32GB card died in less than 3 months.  SanDisk will replace the card under warranty, but the SanDisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month.  For two months, the card worked flawlessly, and then it started to have intermittent errors.  I thought it might be a problem with my phone, so I tried a 16GB card, and I never had a problem. When I returned to the 32GB card, the intermittent problems returned and got worse.  Eventually the card completely died, and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computer-connected card reader.  Both Windows 7 and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when it's well seated.I plan to update this when I have used my warranty-replacement card for three months, but that will be at least four months from now."
1.0,"It worked fine at a start and offered great speeds, but after a few months my cell phone started to eject and reconnect it several times per day (at least once per hour).  That made my phone eat up its whole battery life in half the time.  I installed Watchdog and noticed that the Google+ process also incremented its CPU usage.  I read somewhere that it was caused by this kind of problems with microSD cards, probably because the process was trying to scan the memory once inserted.  In another forum there are also reports of this kind of problems with some of the latest generation SanDisk microSD cards.Now I decided to purchase a Samsung one which can be found similarly priced.  My phone stopped acting up, and its battery life came back to normal."
1.0,"Junk! Do not buy! Bought 2, returning both."
1.0,Awful controller. Buttons don't work
1.0,I bought this for the exact model but it doesn't fit at all.
1.0,The only reason I give one star is that I cant give zero stars.Just lost all my files in the SD in my S3. I cant believe I trust my valuable information in this company. AVOID THIS ITEM. Dont recommend it.
1.0,"Fast card while it worked.  Died less than a week after return period expired....  Must note though that that is the nature of any memory storage card or drive.  Some fail, some last forever.  Not SanDisk's fault, not amazons fault - it is what it is.  BUT it is for this reason that i think Amazon should extend the return period on items which fall into this category.  Dont worry amazon, i still love you - but feel like your played the role of a proctologist on this one..."
1.0,"First of all I am not sure if the product i received is a CLASS 10 memory card. The reason why i say this is that the maximum write speed i get on my WINDOWS 8 system is 1.4 MB/Sec. Also i have issues with my system recognizing the card and i do frequently receive 'Disk Cannot Be Formatted' error.I am totally dissatisfied with this product considering the fact that i have a brand new laptop, Do not recommend SANDISK please check other brands."
1.0,"Product arrived and worked for only a month. Now it will not take a charge, it says plugged in not charging. I would not recommend this manufacture of laptop batteries. Shop around and always read the the reviews."
1.0,"When I first got this router it worked flawlessly. It has been three months and now the wireless connection is the most frustrating connection I've dealt with in my life. If I restart the router it works fine for about five minutes, and after that it regularly pings greater than 500ms locally. It is not a connection issue by my devices as several devices in my home all have horrible ping to this router. inSSIDer shows that the signal is strong and isn't dropping so it must be something with the actual routing and not the wireless connection itself.<br /><br />It makes basic wireless internet browsing a horrendous experience, let alone online gaming which is half of what I purchased this router for."
1.0,These cables did not work at all for charging any of the IPad models we have that use the lightning connector. So I'm not sure why they would even sell them claiming that they did.
1.0,Purchased this to record an epic rubicon trail trip. Within two hours I got an sd card failure. Had to break out a slower card to finish recording trip.  FAIL.
1.0,"I've requested a replacement, so I'll update this review after I receive a replacement.  But the first card I got, it could be read, but every time I put it into the computer, it said there were errors with it.  It couldn't repair the errors.  I couldn't even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work.  I could create folders on the card, but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders.  I tried many many things and nothing worked.  I know SanDisk makes decent products, so I will change the review later."
1.0,"You can do anything with the remote and even google remote on your phone. It is cheap chineses made, if you has been use chineses product made you known what I mean . Just me , it is very difficult use the signal from remote very interrupt. Don't buy it, try Product made by USA company like Amazon, Apple and Google cast"
1.0,"Terrible. Do not buy!!! Tip broke off the first one I ordered in less than a week. Purchased a second one, thinking maybe it was something I'd done, but tip broke off of that one as well."
1.0,"Have been through two of these - one within the warranty, one just past warranty.  While performance was good (albeit short range on the 5g band) - they didnot last!  Problems occur with loosing one of the two bands - intermittently - followed by a full failure.  Both these units had full UPS protection their whole short little lives so it's not a power problem. Both used in a nominal home setting (approx 10 connected devices).  Too expensive to try again.  Excellent statistical end-of-life engineering ASUS!"
1.0,Not very good.
1.0,they worked for one week and then diied
1.0,"The product is flawless. The software updates are not. They took over an hour to install and update. My on screen keyboard is UNUSABLE it's so slow. A hard reset fixed it today, for the time being. I've heard one or two say that it went back to being slow after a few days. Time will tell.<br /><br />Hold down the power button for 15 seconds or so, until it shuts down. Do not hit anything on the screen when it asks you if you want to power down. Just hold down the power button until it shuts off. Wait 20 seconds before turning it back on. If it helps you, find this post useful. This needs more attention.<br /><br />The product itself is worth five stars but if the new software update makes the keyboard useless, then you can barely use your kindle the way it's meant to be used and that's a big deal. Even a brand new car with a shot out motor is only worth a few hundred bucks. I wanted to rate this higher, but I can't.<br /><br />Please fix this! Swype and keyboard functions are ESSENTIAL.<br /><br />EDIT: it's slow again today, I had to repeat the process."
1.0,"not good at all. after a week, a key felt down"
1.0,Kindle Reader was returned because it was not as versatile as my Kindle Fire.  Protection Plan was therefore not usable nor transferable to my other unit.
1.0,The stand is sub-par and doesn't even attach to the ipad.  Taking the label off left a sticky mess that I can't remove.  Now I find out it would cost more to return it than I paid for the item.
1.0,This battery did not last one hour.  The amount of money charged for this battery was totally not worth it.  Even though they returned most of my money I would not recommend it at all for any reason.  Save your money with this company.
1.0,"Got this to use with my GoPro Hero 3 black edition. Put it in, seemed to work. tried to get the data from the card after using it for a second and the card says it needs to be formatted.Looked to gopro's website and it is NOT on their recommended card list. Reason being is that the card isn't fast enough. It's a class ten yes but clearly not fast enough.Definitely get the recommended card, IF it does work at first it will probably die in a couple of days."
1.0,It keeps disconnecting and the volume isn't that high
1.0,"I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on 'mount sd card' it said it didn't understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It's extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don't understand why it's that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn't know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster..."
1.0,Top handle ripped within a week. So dissatisfied with this purchase.
1.0,"Very disappointed!  This is my 5th, and last, Toshiba. I bought this laptop specifically because the specs say the memory is upgradeable to 16g, which I wanted to do to improve the speed of video editing.  What Toshiba is falling to tell customers is that the memory can only be upgraded by them, at an obscenely expensive cost...almost as much as the laptop.  All my other Toshiba's allowed me to upgrade my memory via a little access door on the bottom.  Not this one.  There's no way for the user to upgrade the memory, and Toshiba is intentionally misleading consumers by not stating this fact in the specs, or on the Amazon sale page.  Likewise with the hard drive.  If you want to change the HD to a SSD, or even have to re-seat the HD (which my older Toshiba has required more than once)  it's not possible.  This laptop is specifically designed to cost the user as much money as possible when it needs anything at all. Even the simplest of upgrades requires an expensive trip to Toshiba.  This laptop is so woefully deficient in memory that you can't even take a screenshot of a Facebook page when you have no other program open but your browser, and 55% of your memory available. (See photo)  Secondly, this laptop is physically dangerous in that the edge is so sharp it actually cuts your wrists when trying to type on it.  Perhaps Toshiba anticipated that customers would want to slit their wrists after waisting $700.00 on this cheaply made hunk of junk?  If so, this laptop is equipped to do the job.  Simply sliding your hand over to the numbers pad can draw blood....really.  Unfortunately, since it was not &#34;dead on arrival&#34; I can't send it back to Amazon, so I'm stuck with an over priced hunk of junk and the hope that there will be a class action suit regarding both the wrist slashing, and Toshiba's false and misleading claim that the memory is upgradeable.  Unless you are contemplating suicide by laptop keyboard, avoid this Toshiba like the plague.."

1.0,Worst product I've ever bought!! They all 3 worked for about a week... And then couldn't get them returned.. Ugh
1.0,Garbage went bad less than 1 year I'm stuck
1.0,Doesn't work at all!!
1.0,"Very unhappy with this card.  I used it to shoot pictures of my husband driving the &#34;8 laps at Daytona&#34; drive.....  Looked at the photos on the card in the camera, they were all there and they were great pictures!  I went to download it to my computer and the picture card crashed, I lost all of the photos!  Not at all happy with the card, but my IT department saved the day and they were able to recover the photos!  So, a once in a lifetime experience was lost and then found!  But, if I hadn't known someone I would have lost those memories forever!"
1.0,"I expected the color to be a little brighter than it actually is. Also, the material looks really cheap. But I suspect it is durable.<br />Caution: it is very difficult to remove the case once you put it on. So make sure there aren't any particles stuck between your Mac and the case when you put it on."
1.0,return not the color I wanted.
1.0,"Bought it Nov 2013 for lite office work and the hdd has already gone bad ( August 2015), asus customer service is more interested to verify warranty expiration that helping - will not buy asus product again - asus is over priced junk!"
1.0,"I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just ""a dud"", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead."
1.0,This computer is regretfully slow and not what I expected.
1.0,Charges too slow. Even with the box that came with your phone originally the cord makes it charge slow
1.0,Brought tablet from Walmart 'WiFi stop working after two months sent it back to ematic they kept it for around 2 months. Got it back and<br />Headphone jack hasn't work properly since been a year now you have prop charger cable against something to charge it
1.0,"Just as someone else had experienced, the cable started having issues after only a few days. At first, I had to wiggle it into a particular position to get it to work, and then it ceased to work completely. Bad QC I guess.<br /><br />I haven't tried to return it, because my time is worth more money than what it's worth. If they sent me a package to return it, I would, but I'm not going to all the trouble of sending it back. I got another cable by another manufacturer (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TZH85K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it's working properly so far. If the second one fails, I'll probably buy an Apple version of the product, because I have to have it this or two of my monitors become useless for my Intel NUC."
1.0,"This is a review of the *bundle*, not the actual NUC.<br /><br />The RAM is cheap Chinese crap that offers extremely poor performance. Loading Windows 8 on this thing is like trying to run the OS on a Pentium II - it's bad.<br /><br />Save your sanity by buying the bare device and purchasing high quality memory and SSD instead."

1.0,"[IMO]<br />Although I don't own a G933, but I own a G930.<br />After reading all product description, I think this is a rip off for a gaming headset with this price tack.<br />Reason as follow:<br />1. As always, you cannot get a real 7.1 headset from Logitech because of the cost I think, so the claiming of 7.1 surround sound must come along with the famous buggy Logitech control software. So the * come behind 7.1 surround sound actually saying,&#34;YOU CAN ONLY GET 7.1-LIKE SURROUND SOUND WHEN YOU USING PC AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSOLE &#34;<br />2. Carrying the same idea from the last point, the claim of Multi-Platform Compatibility actually is silly, G933 can support it just because a 3.5 mm audio jet was added as one of the inputs. once you plug the audio on this G933, here is what you got: A WIRED, STEREO headset with LED lighting on it, it do sound like a $20 headset to me. ...<br />What?! it is a $200 gaming headset?! Come on!<br />3. Customizable lighting? What the...?! I CANNOT EVEN see the lighting on the headset while I am wearing it! COME ON genius!<br />4. G930 is a much reasonable choice I think, if you know how to fix the auto-turn off issue by a hack on the Logitech gaming software<br />[/IMO]"

If you are looking for something like this.  Look elsewhere."
1.0,Does not fit Samsung note 10.1 but clearly says it does?
1.0,"If you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. I bought this card in November of 2012 and it worked great for a while. The card started failing in my Galaxy Note 2 in the beginning of January. After reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. Please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. I have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock Jelly Bean, 1 with Ice Cream Sandwich, and 1 with a Cyanogenmod custom firmware. All 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". Even formatting the card in both Windows and using Android do not seem to fix the issue. I was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. It does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. If you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. I am glad I used dropbox for my phone so I did not lose any pictures or videos."

1.0,wrong part for my laptop hp xt178
1.0,Like many others I report that this piece of crap didn't work (Mini White HDMI to AV RCA Converter).  The RCA video (yellow video output) wouldn't sync up as input to a known good display device (tried switching this converter to either NTSC or PAL).  A total waste of money as Amazon won't give a refund.  It's clear these folks are putting out a fair number of these that are junk with only a few folks reporting success.  You can form your own theory as to how bad you want to imagine the depths of Chinese junk manufacturing. The single sheet &#34;User Guide&#34; is a similar joke.  The promotional-speak in it and on the box says no power adapter is required when in fact this box must be powered (using the supplied USB cable) by the 5 VDC of a USB port.  Don't waste your money and I wish Amazon had some way to just terminate availability of such a waste of time/money of their customers.  I am now all the more suspicious of buying anything more from Amazon in general.
1.0,Horrible!
1.0,I bought this bookbag for my husband to use for his college classes. He has some back problems so carrying his books can be hard on him . College books are not light and I needed a reliable bookbag that could handle the weight of a laptop and a few thick text books. I was disappointed in this bag the second I opened the box. The material the bag is made of is very thin. The stitching looks unreliable and I felt it would come lose easily. When I put the books in the bag the bag didnt seem like it was capable of holding them. There was no cushion or protection for the books. The straps are not well sewn on and also look as though they could come lose easily. Overall this seems like a cheaply made bag I could get from any walmart or target and I was completely unsatisfied with the purchase. A bookbag is something that needs to be well made and reliable and this one failed to meet those standards. I returned the bag for a refund immediately.
1.0,"Arris has the worst customer service ever!!!<br />The modem was stop working in 10 months, the modem still under warranty and Arris customer support  refuse to take it back to repair or replace."
1.0,I purchased this for a 4k monitor the AMH 399U (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XTVGM7C?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00) (a korean monitor). I knew going in that the cables that came with the monitor wouldn't work and that they would cause flickering and complete picture loss. I purchased this cable preemptively. Upon receipt of the monitor I plug in the cable into my Gigabyte 290X video card and the monitor and was greeted with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. This was the highest this cable could do stating that it had an communication issue. The default cables with the monitor work at the appropriate resolution but flickered as expected. I don't know if this is an issue with length in excess of 2 meters or not. I ended up getting an Accell UltraAV B142C-007B cable and it works perfect. Maybe try the 6Ft version and milage may be better. For 4K stay away from this cable.
1.0,Computer would not boot up.  It powered up but would not boot up.  Sent back and ordered another.  Hopefully the new one will work properly.
1.0,"Horrible product. A month later, it stopped working. Reached out to seller and was told that it wasn't their problem, basically, and to contact Amazon customer service. Do not buy. Waste of money, especially when you're battery is on it's last leg. Look elsewhere."

1.0,"After this, I think I'm completely done with this brand. This is the 2nd HP laptop I have purchased (for school work, general Web surfing) where the screen just quits. 1st time I was in the middle of typing a report when I took a break for dinner. When I returned the screen was asleep (not unusual) but would not wake up (unusual). Pretty much the same thing happened again on this most recent purchase (Nov. 2013). This laptop has hardly been used and wasn't even opened until after Christmas.  It's been used maybe 1 week out of a month on average.  Possibly less. I spent more time on my cellphone because it was much faster responding.  I had/have verizon fios wifi and speeds were great on everything else connected.  Pretty ridiculous HP. The system lagged from the start and the touchscreen didn't seem very accurate so I mostly used the keyboard and mouse. I'll be staying away from HP laptops going forward  that is for sure!"
1.0,don't buy.....waist of money!
1.0,"This monitor arrived to my house broken, when it was posted as hardly been used."

2.0,It worked well for a couple of months and then out of the blue just stopped charging. What can I really expect though.
2.0,"colors not as vibrant as they appear in photo, a bit large for a true14 inch."
2.0,not comfortable to use and my mouse (which I ordered with the pad and was a recommendation) doesn't glide well.  I had to go back to traditional mouse pad.
2.0,Pretty cheap. I was rather disappointed in the quality of this item. I would rather have the access point exposed than use this. Returning.
2.0,"The disk is incompatible with older version of M.2 standard, because of DEVSLP and there is no warning about it. It disappeared after boot on my Lenovo y510p. I complained to ADATA, but I got a replacement instead of my money back, now I have to sell it myself.  UPDATE: I managed to run it by switching from AHCI to IDE (Compatible) mode in BIOS. I had edit registry for Windows not to crash and regenerate initramfs for Linux not to crash after that change. Also the read speed will be 1/3rd of the original, so that actually sucks."
2.0,it discharges too quickly
2.0,"This battery worked, but I had trouble getting it to stay attached to the clip (didn't seem to fit right) and the star screwdriver that came with it didn't fit.  Luckily I had a small phillips screwdriver that worked.  You may want to try another brand.  There are a couple of good videos on youtube showing how to take your Nook HD apart.  I highly recommend you review them before tackling this.  Keep the piece of tape from the old battery for reuse.  Using a guitar pick (sliding it around the cover) to separate the top works well."
2.0,"Looks nice...however, you need to modify 3 things for it to work properly. Being that it's $10, a) what'd you expect, b) it'd be a waste of time and money to send this thing back so I just modified it:<br /><br />1) There are 2 pins on the circuit board that are too long and are touching the case. This will cause your computer to not connect to the drive. Simple fix, bend those 2 pins down. 2) When connector plate is connected to the drive the connector plate is off center and will not close properly. Simple fix, shave one of the sides on the connector plate. 3) Since the connector plate is off centered, the screws are not aligned properly. Simple fix, widen the screw holes on the connector plate."
2.0,"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand."

2.0,"I saw and demo-ed one of these in a local electronics store, and wanted one for about a year.  Finally, I decided to pull the trigger and buy one.  I thought it would be &#34;like an enormous iPad&#34; (since it is a touchscreen) that can also go on a stand and be a TV (for streaming videos and the like) and could also be used for Skype lessons.  At the same time that I purchased this Lenovo Horizon 2 27: All in One, my husband purchased a beautiful 27&#34; iMac and made fun of me for wanting the Lenovo.  In addition to the fact that the Lenovo was a touchscreen, the Lenovo was also less than half the price of the iMac and could easily be carried around or rolled around on a cart.  So when both products showed up at the same time, the computers were set up and my kids immediately flocked to the much more fun Lenovo.  That's where the fun ends.  Almost immediately, the &#34;Power On&#34; button on the side of the Lenovo got stuck in the frame of the computer.  No matter what we did (with tweezers, etc.) we couldn't get the button to come out - so the computer was in the constant state of being powered on - in other words, not working at all.  At this point, my kids had used the computer a handful of times, and I had not used it at all - we had had it for a few weeks.  Apparently, the warranty doesn't cover this type of issue (which is considered damage by owner, not a faulty part).  The numerous times I've tried to call Lenovo for help, they couldn't find the Serial Number in their database at all, so I couldn't register the warranty online or by phone.  I had to take the computer into a service center during which I waited in a LONGGGGGGG line on a Saturday during which several customers ended up &#34;going postal&#34; on the numb employees working there - screaming about how long they waited and about how someone calls them and says it's ready and then it's not...  After a couple of hours of waiting, my number was called, and the person helping me said that the stuck &#34;ON&#34; button was not covered under warranty, but they would request that the problem be covered as an exception.  We had zero confidence that the exception would be granted.  We left the the Lenovo, original box and packaging and cord with a strong sense that we'll never see it again - it was like dropping it into a black hole (completely disorganized place).  The couple of tissue paper like forms that they left with us had no details (like that the computer had been left there with the original box and power cord), and I was forced to sign something that says &#34;I hereby acknowledge that the damage was due to my personal negligence...&#34;  It's been several weeks, and after waiting a LONGGGGG time on the phone line when calling the well-kept-secret phone number of the service center, I'm left on hold when someone finally picks up the line and/or I can't get anyone to pick up the line to see what the status is of the computer.  At this point, I'm willing to just pay for someone to pry out the ON button.  My husband keeps giving me this knowing I-told-you-so look.  Drives me crazy when he's right!"
2.0,"Worked fine for about a month and now the keys are not responding well, if at all. Reinstalled and checked the cable but it didn't help. I'll spend a bit more on the next one."
2.0,"This mouse is brand new and already malfunctioning. It works great at first, but if I walk away from my computer for a few minutes and then come back, the mouse doesn't work anymore! I have to turn it off and on again to get it to work. SO ANNOYING and disruptive."
2.0,"I am a huge fan of Steel Series. But these ruined my 5 star history with them. I used the Steel Series V2 for years and had 2 headsets and even gifted them to friends and streamers based on how highly I thought of them. So like a naive consumer, I figured the V3s would be an ever better experience.<br /><br />Three weeks in, the poorly glued adjusting band came apart, leaving a floppy faux leather strip constantly whipping against my head when I removed them. Then I a problem developed in voice chat across many software platforms (skype, teamspeak, steam chat and mumble) where people could hear the sounds from my headphones in the call. I am not sure if this is a faulty internal thing where the mic is too sensitive, but there is not a setting that has allowed me to prevent this.<br /><br />Everything about the V3s has felt inferior to the V2s, the cushion adjustable head band, gone. The quality of separate line audio/mic, gone. The convenient and secure Mute button on the line, not gone, but on the headset, which means fumbling against my head to make sure I am muted."
2.0,I'm sure it was good tabelt but screen arrived all discolored and static so I was unlucky
2.0,"Keyboard works fine, the but there is no lightning cable pass through to connect other devices, especially a charger while the keyboard is connected.

I couldn't count the number of DVD drives I've owned or used over the years, but what I do know, is that this is the noisiest drive I have ever used. I am going to replace it, it is so noisy. I bought an ASUS DVD drive several years ago, and it was quiet. Recently I had been using Samsung Super WriteMaster drives, but they had a high failure rate. The ASUS drive I bought years ago also failed, but since I had only tried one, and was otherwise happy with it, I decided to give ASUS another try. Unfortunately ASUS quality and engineering capability have regressed. This drive is junk."
2.0,"1. The ribbon was not included while they claim that they do include one with the keyboard. Luckily, I managed to remove the one from my defective keyboard. Since Dell glues it, it is a very risky operation as it could be damaged in the process of being un-glued<br />2. Please pay very close attention to the picture. If you compare your keys with this keyboard, you will notice some significant differences. For example, the left shift key is narrower and the * key on the numeric pad is replaced by the x key. Since Excel uses the * in the formulas, this can be an issue.<br />3. They say it is brand new, yet, I noticed a paint chip when I un-packed it. Sounds more refurbished than new."
2.0,Still cannot use this with my automobile test app that originally uses the old iPhone 3 style plug
2.0,Had problems with the unit and sent it back.  Fast refund of funds.  Found a similar unit new for a little more.
2.0,"I had to go back to the &#34;universal&#34; charger because my laptop told me immediately, this charger was insufficient. I bought this so it would charge the new battery correctly and not ruin it, but using it would ruin the battery much, much sooner."
2.0,"I'm giving 2 stars because reliability of this router is bad for a high end product.<br /><br />I've had this for about 1 year and it works as you would expect most of the times... high speed, long range, etc. Sadly it cannot handle multiple devices using some bandwith concurrently for too long. I've noticed this since I started streaming Xbox one to my W10 PC while also watching streams in HD in multiple devices. The router seems to just not be able to handle the work,  everything communication dies for about 10 seconds in every device i have attached and then it comes back to life on its own.<br /><br />I've also had intermittent issues connecting devices to this router, for some reason it just doesn't allow them to connect at all until I power reset it.<br /><br />Yes, I constantly check for firmware and software updates, they haven't helped.<br /><br />I would recommend to people that are looking for a high end router to look somewhere else, this guy will fail you when you most need it for its supposed high end capabilities."
2.0,"The battery needed to be charged be I could use it. Also, it was difficult recharging the battery"
2.0,App is useless won't read its own file format doesn't do half the stuff it's supposed to
2.0,Mine developed a short after a few months. You get what you pay for
2.0,The case is fine.  The color is more of a burnt orange..
2.0,"As for the description its great and matches up with everything perfectly for the most part. The problem is when gaming for periods of time this isn't able to withstand the heat output even with the fan manually at 100 pct the entire time. the fact that the card is also overclocked and that a person will not be able to lower it will create issues with certain games, Call of Duty Advanced War being one of those games as the game has an issue with overclocked graphics cards.<br /><br />My purpose was to spend a bit less money than needed and hope to get something that can keep up, although I now have a graphics card which I want nothing more than to get rid of this and spend the extra $100 to get something much nicer"
2.0,Bought it in July and just passed my return date it has been giving me problems. Various issues are the pointer will drag to the bottom by itself. Second is having to click on mouse several times before it recognizes you pressed it. It's a pretty expensive mouse to be giving me these problems.
2.0,"It cracked after 3 weeks of use. Great color, not so great quality. I had expected more from Speck."
2.0,It is definitely not for 15.6&#34; I have dell 7000 series and it did not fit the whole screen. it is short vertically as well as horizontally.  it is more like 13.3'.
2.0,"I ordered this memory card because, obviously i needed more space on my phone. One of the reasons why I prefer android to apple products is it is way easier to upgrade storage space with android. My memory card arrived when I expected it to and now I have more than enough space on my galaxy S4....... I once gave this product a five star and everything before this sentence is the review from when I was satisfied with it. But now I'm having problems. I can't delete stuff of of the sd card. I tried formatting it on both my phone and my computer but nothing well delete so now I'm giving it a two star."
2.0,The cover started to come apart in a week. Little duct tape and it will never fail now.
2.0,"Looks functional,  but did not fit my 17 inch Dell laptop. Was able to get most of the laptop in,  but one corner was sticking out no matter how hard I tried to push him. Had to send it back"
2.0,cheaply made
2.0,The bottom part of the case isn't very secure.  Update: Started cracking after about 2 months
2.0,"Decent, but forgets configuration after power loss."
2.0,"+ 5 stars for being a great case.<br /><br />-3 stars for not specifying that the all the threads are metric. God forbid I live in the greatest nation on earth and need a case the uses 'merican units.<br /><br />Seriously, though, you cost me a lot of time, money, and effort trying to mount my current equipment with UTS standard screw sizes on a metric case. These are elementary specs you need to specify.<br /><br />Edit: I should also say that it didn't come with any screws, so it wasn't a simple matter of switching the screws out. If they had included mounting screws, I probably wouldn't have had so many problems."
2.0,Seems like the magnet is not strong enough
2.0,"Great hardware design, terrible OS and App Store make it frustrating to use.  Battery not great."
2.0,"The adhesive strip keeps falling off after only 2 days. I followed instructions to the letter, and even cleaned them according to insert."
2.0,"Bought this to use in my Samsung SIII as it was supposed to be a fast card. Worked fine until it totally died after less than a year of very little us due to the design of the SIII. Phone popped up a message that the SD card had been removed (it hadn't). Nothing I did to the phone brought the card back up. Removed it and tried it in my laptop (Win7) and other computer (XP Pro) and it is totally dead, neither will even recognize its in the drive. Working with Sandisk to get a replacement, they want all kinds of fairly useless information, will see if I get an RMA number and replacement card.This is the first memory card I have ever had fail.As an update, warranty service from Sandisk has proven to be non-existent. They first asked to have over 16 questions answered, then mysteriously lost all the answers I sent back, three times."
2.0,"Still just as slow and glitchy as the first edition fire. Still not flash compatible which renders the browser useless. Freezes constantly, crap battery life and regularly occuring issues with loading the page you were on last.  Incredibly disappointing."
2.0,"I bought this for my son instead of the mini iPad. I have to say it's difficult to use. Storage is always full, locks up continuously and so many dang ads. Just to delete an app is ridiculous. I really had high hopes for this. Only good for reading books, Hulu and Netflix."
2.0,Nice but really really slow
2.0,Used it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet.  Stopped working after about 10 months without warnings.  My tablet now recognizes as blank or un-formatted card; my computers won't even recognize it at all!  I am still trying to recover some priceless photos of my kids since my last backup of the card...
2.0,Great for about 2 weeks.  Started to smell like burning plastic and got really warm.
2.0,"These speakers are pretty bad. The sound quality is not good at all. I'm considering returning them, but I don't think it's worth the  effort or cost."
2.0,I had had this drive in my computer for a while an though it was an overrated regarding how fast SSD boot up until I replaced the SanDisk with Samsung SSD.  That was night and day I found out.  Never buy SSD from this company anymore.
2.0,"I bought two of these Memory Cards for use with my Logitech Alert 750e Outdoor Master Security Camera's. So far, I have found them to be unreliable. I am not entirely certain if this is because of the Camera system or the Memory Card themselves. The camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted. This is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important, the failure of the SD card would be very troublesome indeed."
2.0,"Like these at first - sturdy, colors are nice, good length, and they worked (at first).  Now they will no longer charge - not &#34;compatible.&#34;"
2.0,"It is as described, WIn8 mini pc. However, you need to uninstall a security program and delete a user account to be safe. Also the biggest fault after an hour or so of streaming HD media it begins to overheat then you get clipping. I will try a wireless usb adapter to see if that helps but may not. I'd recommend spending more and get one without a metal housing like this. Spend the extra $50-100 it will be worth it. Also the plugs on this are mini to full size -- for example the HDMI connector. It comes with cables but they are not that secure & could easily be broken on the pc side. Again spend a little more and get a nicer PC that will be more durable.<br /><br />I have tried a heat sink on top of the pc but it doesn't help much. Hilarious the heat sink looks like a monster on this little pc."
2.0,Not bad but the i-pad 2 has a camera
2.0,Headphones broke during the first use. The black mesh part came off and it was impossible to put it back on.
2.0,"Before doing research, i assumed this card would support my brand new Hero 3 camera... considering it was sold off the Gopro site, it was a no brainer... or so i thought.Anyhow, the card seems to preform well under most circumstances WITHOUT using the Protunes settings. (The problems with the Hero 3 where due to the slow write speed of this card under Protunes settings, without this setting the Hero works fine)However, after a few timelapse issues (2 - 5 sec timelapse, which is well in this card's speeds).I noticed the card is corrupt. I tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists. I trust Sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work, however this card has failed!I would not recommend this EXPENSIVE card, id jump for a Samsung, or even the Transcend cards. They even come with a better warranty then this card.Nothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace...."
2.0,"HERE IT IS PEOPLE:<br />Terrible CAP LOCK FEATURE, a light flickers briefly to notify you of it being on or off.<br /> (and many times you can not tell if it is on or not.)<br /><br />The keypad seem to not respond as good as it should."
2.0,doesnt usually work on win 7 or win server 2012
2.0,It's very flimsy.
2.0,Sound terrible anytime volume is tuned further than 1/2 way up.
2.0,i don't like it
2.0,"The product is a lot bulkier and bigger than it looks compared to the pictures. Since it is so big and bulky, it can cover up some of your ports on the side of your laptop. It does not stick on very well and it is constantly falling off when you are carrying your laptop elsewhere. It is very annoying. It is only good when you have your laptop set on the table. If it only mount better onto the laptop, then the size would not matter as much. The vacuum is quite loud when turned on fully max. The plus side is that it does indeed cool downs your laptop tremendously. It does a better job than a cooling pad."
2.0,Didn't fit my husband's truck. Size a bit misleading
2.0,Quite possibly the poorest quality item I've ever purchased.<br />wasnt cut out properly. Wouldn't separate from the paper backing. Ripped in several places. Filled with bubbles.
2.0,"Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.  I have purchased aelago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)to use the 64GB MicroSDHC card as a thumb drive."
2.0,"Cheap stuff.  The older reviews here clearly aren't for the same product that I purchased since mine has no port covers and isn't waterproof.  This item is cheap plastic, has no instructions or warranty, and the stand flops around like a dog's tail when you pick up your tablet."
2.0,"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing."
2.0,"The case is cracking everywhere and all 4 of the corners have chipped off. I am extremely careful with my macbook, as I bought it with my own money. So I know that it isn't from me throwing it around or anything. I would not repurchase."
2.0,Does not hold my iPad in constantly falling out
2.0,The shift key placement on the right side is absolutely horrific. I'm always pressing pg up instead. Avoid this if you touch type. Get the updated version!
2.0,"Unresponsive, too small to be comfortable."
2.0,"The original charger that came with my MacBook was made in Japan, had the Apple logo on it, and also says &#34;Apple Japan&#34; on the side.  This charger is a slightly different size, and the wall plug attachment fits differently.  Although this product has worked for the past several weeks, I do NOT consider it a &#34;Genuine Apple&#34; product.  It also runs a little hotter than my original charger.<br /><br />It works so far and cost only $34, so I'm giving it two stars."
2.0,"Item was good for a while but all of a sudden my computer started blue screen memory dumping, then restarted itself and said boot disk could not be found. I reinstalled original HDD and the problem went away."
2.0,Never could get it to work properly
2.0,"Fan itself (motor, bearing, and blades) works great. Frame is a great idea, but...not so durable. Be careful when handling, and don't separate the rubber pins, you'll never get it back together. I'd have returned it but I tossed the boxes for them, so the fan got tossed too. Oh well. To replace them I bought the same brand but regular solid frame. Should have in the first place."
2.0,The arm broke 2 weeks into using this.<br />Not enough reinforcement and now it occupies a space in my &#34;unused&#34; computer peripherals.<br />Just a gimmick and not worth the money.
2.0,Sounds is muffledeven after hours of tweeking
2.0,Not a good product. Purchased it because of the look and usb dongle less feature but it is a troublesome device. Doesn't work with windows 7 at all! Connected to Macbook air (yosemite) but I have to search and connect it every time I reboot! Microsoft should provide appropriate drivers for this mouse to get it working with most devices. Even there is no help or support information for this product in the web. Better look for any other device with similar feature.
2.0,"8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work."
2.0,I used this while I was a student in college. With heavy usage on my laptop the case broke down fairly quickly. First things to go were the small pieces of plastic that hold the case onto the laptop. I wouldn't purchase again.
2.0,The laptop was great while it worked. After less than a week the screen stopped powering on completely. The internals themselves were fine but the screen just gave up.
2.0,"Bubbles, bubbles bubbles.  I can't get rid of them.  Easy to install, but lots of bubbles."
2.0,"The case is a replacement for one I bought a few years ago and it is the same quality, however the screen saver that they sent is half the size of the screen."
2.0,It glitches alot as in it will turn in to a white screen but it ends up working and to day the on \off button pushes in and became loose so its nearly impossible it and sometimes it  opens apps Randomly and starts to glitch when typing
2.0,"Barely lights my full-tower case at all.  Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it does work, but offers very limited lighting."
2.0,Battery doesn't last as long as reported and goes to sleep and won't come back on  until you place it in cradle to wake it back up.
2.0,After exactly month and a half this card is done...and with it i lost all my pics and videos...just after the return policy expired!! card is not recognized by my phone or PC. Trying to get RMA from Sandisk...I own the S3 and have read extensive problems with the 32 and 64gb card class 10! Samsung says is Sandisk...and Sandisk says is the phone ??? But i've seen other cards failing with different phones! All Android by the way...What's the problem ?
2.0,"I purchased this iPad Air 2 case about 9 months ago in gray.  I initially liked almost everything about it, especially the transparent hard plastic back that revealed the Apple on the back of the iPad.  The magnet is strong and works well for wake/sleep.  It has a soft inside cover with simple lines, low profile.  Today a piece of plastic dropped off a corner of the hard clear plastic back.  When I examined it more closely, I noticed cracks on all the corners and that now the case can barely hang on to the iPad.  I'm glad the plastic fell off so I could discover the problem before the iPad dropped entirely out of the case onto the floor.  This case has had light use and no abuse so I think it should have endured much longer.  I had purchased a different brand case for my husband's iPad Mini at the same time.  It has a &#34;rubberized&#34; back and is still functioning and looks great.  I don't like the appearance as well as the Yippee Color Series, but it's obviously more durable.  I'll try that next."
2.0,"I had this product for one week before the auxiliary cable stopped working properly and now the Microlab speakers only work if I keep the cable in a certain position. The clip-on is shallow and has poor grip which makes it loose, wobbly, and slip easily. Requires a USB and a headphone jack, when there are similar products that only require one of these to be occupied. When the speakers work, the audio can be loud but the quality is mediocre."
2.0,"I've had 2 of these speaker systems in the last 5 years, and now I'm going to Logitech or Creative. The speakers and sub sound great, amazing in fact, but the problem is with the controller pod. Seems the pot doesn't last more than 2 years or so. One of the speakers will quit working...press down on the blue lighted center of the pod and great sound. Let it go, and one speaker dies. As I said, the speakers are fine, it's in the pod. Take note C/A, fix that crappy pot and you've got a great little system for 30 bucks."
2.0,Very frustrating packaging. I broke the sd card trying to open it up. If you use scissors carefully then it shouldn't be a problem.
2.0,Wasn't a fan of this case! Replaced it right away. Looked too cheap.
2.0,Not so &#34;heavy duty&#34;. After a month only one of them is working. That didn't cost as much as the others but it would have been nice if they had lasted longer.
2.0,"I want to love this unit, but it just would not work properly for me. I bought this to replace a Nighthawk X6 R8000 and a Motorola Modem and I had nothing but problems with it. 1) I could not successfully get a device I needed to forward ports to to work properly. Since I have a Nighthawk, I know my way around Netgear's firmware - so I knew exactly what to do. The AC1900 just would not work properly. According to the unit's UI I had it set up properly - alas, I could not get it working.<br /><br />With the Nighthawk X6 R8000 port forwarding worked perfectly.<br /><br />2) My Sonos system (which is hard wired into my network) kept stopping.<br />The stream(s) would just quit. With the Nighthawk I would run audio for DAYS without any interruptions. Not so here.<br /><br />I thought ok, maybe I need to update the firmware - guess what?<br /><br />You can't. Because it's a combo device, Comcast needs to certify / release any new firmware. You know what that means right?<br /><br />They're never going to to do. They have no incentive.  They don't care.<br /><br />I like that I was able to to future proof my cable modem speeds, but not at the incredible expense of network that would not work properly AND firmware that most likely will never be upgrade.<br /><br />Very sad."
2.0,"This mouse is an extremely cheap mouse. It has no heft to it, it feels like a plastic box, and it would break very easily.<br /><br />It works fine, and the range is accurate.<br /><br />I'm definitely getting a mouse that is much more expensive than this in the future."
2.0,"this card would not show 64 GB until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in FAT32 with 59 GB free for my Cowon J3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 GB to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my PMP when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microSDXC slot of the AFT PRO-57U, which is connected to a Syba VIA VL800 USB 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.UPDATE: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my Cowon J3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not SDXC specific because they have changed something in them."
2.0,The class ten card failed and jamed my phone a KYOCERA RISE : it was replaced with another regular H D 32GB SanDisk card and is working fine. The micro SDHC CARDS are 1/3 less in price than they used to be and are a best buy by far.Your Music PalJoe Mal
2.0,"I bought this case to protect my surface pro. I had it for maybe, two or three weeks, and the surface pro is already on it's way back to Microsoft (costing me $350 to repair) becuase the screen is shattered.  Now, I did trip in a parking garage. I'm also 5 foot tall. My surface pro was inside this case, inside a bag on my shoulder, that also contained my cell phone, my ipad, and my ipod. The only item that was damaged was the surface pro. To say I'm a bit dissatisfied with the amount of &#34;protection&#34; it provides, is an understatement.  The most sensitive area on a tablet or electronic with a screen is the corner. It's the only part that isn't protected at all.  If you are using the case just for looks, it does it's job. If you're using the case to actually protect your surface pro, I wouldn't spend a dime on it."
2.0,Pretty garbage. Slower and less powerful than even the one that comes with the phone. Had gas station chargers better than this.
2.0,Stop working after a week😡
2.0,"I don't love this. It looks nice but it doesn't stand up great, it's pretty heavy and awkward for me.  I will use it for now but probably replace it eventually.  I wish I would have kept looking but it's hard to tell exactly what the problems are from just a picture.  Oh well....lesson learned."
2.0,Great
2.0,"very flimsy, wouldnt recommend it"
2.0,I thought this cover had a screen protector too when it is labeled as a full body protector. It does not.
2.0,"It is a micro usb cable. That's about it.<br /><br />But the cables seem to low capacity and take forever to charge. I previously used Anker's micro USB cable which had worn down over time. I have had good success with Amazon's micro USB 3.0 cable, but this seems to be quite different. I regrettably have moved back to Anker for this particular cable."
2.0,"Had alot of connectivity issues, causing me to have to detach and reattach the cover, but the extra battery boost is nice. the track pad is terrible"
2.0,"The offset is off by at least 3-4mm. I bought mine earlier today, had free same day shipping, used it for 2 hours to take notes, it drove me nuts, repackaged it and sent it away for a return. Definitely do not recommend this product for a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2; I also used it on my Galaxy Note 3, same deal, offset is off. It also appears very hesitant. I feel I have to press extra hard to use it. Oh - and it feels bulky. I prefer the 'toothpick&#34; that comes with the device after having had used this joke of a product."
2.0,"When it works, the speed is fine, but what's really frustrating is that every few minutes the USB connection fails, saying the device malfunctioned and Windows did not recognize it, and it either returns after a few seconds, or I have to unplug it and put it back in."
2.0,I like the contrasting color and the magnetic closer. It is already showing wear around the corrners.
2.0,sparks when pluged in is unsafe to use
2.0,"I bought mine the other day and it came in the mail quickly. I immediately liked it, although the end (the touch screen part) is not attached to anything. It is literally a microfiber tip attached to a little plastic screw that is too small to screw into the part it is suppose to. I would return it, but I don't have time to wait around for another one, so I bought some superglue and glued the little thing to where it was suppose to screw in. I would not buy this again, as the very first one I got was defective."
2.0,"This is a terrible laptop. I would not recommend that anyone buy it. The trackpad is a total joke. I get so frustrated that it hardly ever works. I now exclusively use a wired mouse with it in order to use laptop. It does have a fast start up, but that's probably because I am too scared to download anything to slow it down anymore once running. Seriously, for a supposed &#34;chromebook killer&#34; it starts to run slow and lag if I have more than 2 tabs open. And I know it's not the Internet because I have 16mb.<br /><br />Cons- needs a secondary mouse to function, slow, can't keep up with Internet websites, little internal hard drive space<br /><br />Pros- awesome blue color, very lightweight, fast start up, free Microsoft trial, 100GB of cloud storage"
2.0,Product works well and was delivered on time. Only issue is that the mouse misses one of the optical sensor (bent b shaped) pads.
2.0,"Would be cool, except this thing can't handle HD youtube video.<br /><br />The Battery life is fantastic.  The simplicity is great, the speed of the machine for simple tasks like email and stuff is all good.<br /><br />But this machine simply CANNOT play youtube videos.  Its just a matter of graphics processing.  Watching a youtube video in 1080p at  is not possible on the samsung chrome book.  This really is disappointing because I LOVE THIS THING outside of this massive short fall.  I think I might have to return it which is really disappointing...<br /><br />If you are watching a video that is mainly dark, it handle it for the most part but as soon as the scene changes and a lot of light textures are shown on screen the video will become choppy and broken.  Its a shame, but it renders this Samsung Chrome book virtually useless for me... its a damn shame."
2.0,"I purchased this product for my Janome sewing machine. Unfortunately, it is not compatible and I never got to see if it worked.  So if you are going to get this for a sewing machine keep in mind that storage is not everything and machines that require a CF probably have incredibly slow processors and the 16 GB will freeze your machine. Try something like 32 MB."
2.0,Mostly unecessary accs. that most of us have already
2.0,Pro's:<br />Super easy to setup. Under Windows 8+ it's just plug and play.<br /><br />Con's:<br />The range on this is a joke. I live in very small apartment (600&#62; sqft) and my wifi router sits in one corner. My desktop is in the opposite corner and I'm lucky to get even one bar.
2.0,I have three kids and was looking for a new case for their iPad. I have another case that we've been very happy with (the iGuy) so I had something to compare to. This case was VERY hard to get on. The material felt more flimsy than I expected. I'm sure it's a decent shock absorber but I didn't even give my kids a chance to use this one because I don't trust the stand either. My rating is probably lower than it would be if I didn't have another case designed for kids that was significantly better. I would check out the iGuy before this one.
2.0,it does not say affixed or in position.<br />I wanted because it appeared it could easily be put on and taken off regularly.<br />That has not worked out. it bows in the middle or falls of and makes using the touch screen awkward or impossible.
2.0,Ok
2.0,"Feels very cheap and the graphics are poor, which I should have known by the price.  I ended up ordering a Samsung galaxy and giving this to my 2 yr old neice."
2.0,"The people posting five star reviews after owning this for a week should be ashamed.  This is a 2-3 star product at best.<br /><br />Advertised at 199 and then an absurd percentage &#34;off&#34; is misleading. It is a $60 tablet selling for $55-60. I got a lightning deal last thanksgiving and at $47 i wish i had returned it. But i kept running into issues with the cord not plugging in all the way so it wouldnt charge and it has sat forgotten for multiple stretches of weeks.  Finally figured out you need to peel the cover back to get a good connection, which means the cover should have had a slightly bigger hole.  It takes about 6-8 hours to charge and lasts about 2-3 hours, way less if you have wifi on. So if downloading something, plug it in first. And dont download two things at once, or try and play and download at the same time. It says dual core but my guess is it is sporting some old processor and a cheap battery.<br /><br />If you have the patience for downloading slowly and one at a time, and want to limit tablet time to a few hours, and need an inexpensive tablet with a very sturdy rubber case, this is not a bad deal. So it gets 2-3 stars. But anyone giving it more than that is stretching the truth. Or have kids breaking their $100-200 tablets...<br /><br />A perfect example, charged overnight, son played it this morning while trying to update two apps and download two games, so with wireless on battery was at 9%. After having to redownload one and find the other after a frustrating search to figure out where it downloaded to but didnt install. Charging for an hour now, its at 17% and that is with wireless off..."
2.0,I've been trying to connect to WiFi for an hour since I received my device. It picks up every network in my building other than mine. Cool product.
2.0,"terrible. Bulky and the tab that holds the edge of my iPad bent. Seeing that it is cardboard underneath fake leather, there is nothing I can do to fix it."
2.0,Cable failed
2.0,Storage is so limited as to make the unit all but useless except to read books.
2.0,This productt needs another part that is not included to work
2.0,"Compatibility problems with Mac Mini 2094.  I purchased it with external power supply.  Mac mini would go to sleep and shut down.  Removed external power supply and it worked normality.  Apparently this is a common problem with USB 3.0 hubs and Macs.  Mac mini now starts automatically when I plug it in when using this hub even when it is unpowered.  I may have to give up on it.<br /><br />Other than that... Looks good, and moves a lot of data."
2.0,"Primarily chose this product for the noise cancelling mic for online vid calls like goog hangout, VSee, etc.: but it actually makes your voice &#34;robo-echo&#34; as co-workers told me. I suspect there's feedback using the Mac's &#34;Use ambient noise control&#34; feature, but not sure. [Will search the review posts/product questions to double-check. Will update the review with anything useful.]<br /><br />Anyways, the product isnt working for me. I almost wish that I'd order the new Apple Earbuds instead..."
2.0,The tabs break off very easily.  I had a 20% failure rate on my home patch panel.  Spend a little more for better quality.  It's not worth the hassle.
2.0,"I ordered it but the main bag is different from the bag in the picture. I'm really disappointed. It still looks ok, but I was expecting a bag with a flap and 2 pockets. I didn't get any of that."
2.0,Good. Wasn't actually what I wanted.
2.0,good price but low quality for music
2.0,"It didn't work. Yeah it's cool to look at, but it didn't last more than 2 months"
2.0,I have only had it since April and it's now August and the left clicker is already sticking and difficult to push.
2.0,The fan fail after 5 months of the original purchase day.
2.0,It was good for a week till the rubber  starting falling off in big strips
2.0,I Wipl be reviewing my friends<br /><br />It is build like a tank<br />An lot con is the command key has to be corrupt glued
2.0,it shard to put on and it makes squeaky noises because the hard plastic is rubbing on the hinges.
2.0,Over all for music files it wasn't bad but once I started saving my video and pictures on it it created corrupted files. My whole Disneyland and six flags vacation  was unreadable. Huge disappointment
2.0,"It was very easy to set up, though the instructions could use some grammar fixes.  I do have quite a few problems with it keeping the connection to the main router.  I have to constantly unplug and re-plug it in to sometimes get it to work again.  Most of the time it says I have internet when I'm connected to it, but I don't.  When it is working, it works great, but it's spotty at best.  Even as I type this I have to change to the main router, for which I only have 1 bar of signal, which is why I bought this in the first place.  The other problem I'm having with it is once it is set up with the SSID and password, I can no longer access the GUID to change any settings.  The only way I can is to do a factory reset and do everything over again.  I've done this 3 times now just to see if there's a setting I'm missing so it will keep a connection to the main router.  Nothing seems to work.  I will try swapping it out with a new one and will update when I receive the replacement."
2.0,"I like the flat design, but this is not for use with video.  I bought this to use with a pair of  HDMI extenders for a projector. Dropped a lot of pixels, leaving white edges on video.  Replaced with a Cat7 cable and all is well.  7/3/17: Finally surrendered the long video run after the CAT7 failed within a few months. Rewired to put entertainment within 25ft of projector and we are back to working. No problems in the last 3 months."
2.0,"Bought this because new cable modem provided by Comcast seems to have a weaker WiFi output as I can no longer get a reliable signal from upstairs.  Put it in upstairs hallway, now I get a great signal in the hallway, but almost non existent in any of the rooms upstairs.  Looking to return this product."
3.0,"They work as they are supposed to. The ear area is a little smaller around than I would prefer. I like the Turtle Beach X12 better but I guess you get what you pay for. The mic is normal quality for a headset like this, I wouldn't say it is worse than the X12s. There should be a way to clip the wire to your shirt as the volume control block is really thick and big and gets in the way."
3.0,The Cruzer has very large secured capacity.  The negative is the speed - takes hours to securely delete trash ... way too long for an SSD.
3.0,"These speakers sound OK,  They are definitely lacking a mid range on sound.  The LED's look cool, but don't really pulse unless you turn the volume really high.  Also, both speakers are on one wire so you can't put the wires through grommets on your desk without minor modification.  The overall feel is a little cheap as well."
3.0,"Not what i wanted or expected from RAZER, felt like cheap plastic....price tooo high!!"
3.0,"It works ok, but for a cost to performance ratio I don't know if it was worth it. They increase on our back deck is negligible. I added this antenna as well as the version without the base so I was hoping for a bit more from the two of them."
3.0,"I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It's not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card."
3.0,Cord is shorter than original one. The adapter also gets extremely hot.
3.0,This product is ok I have problems with keeping charging my computor like if I move it to a certain spot it will charger but if I move it even a little it will stop charging. But it's OK it does its job sometimes there better ones out there probably
3.0,To heavy and not enough time to figure it out yet..will follow up
3.0,good
3.0,works well; but keeps dropping out of computer
3.0,none
3.0,The good news is that one of the tablets don't work & I got a full refund. Thanks to Paypal great customer service skills!!!!
3.0,"I've had this cable for about five months now, and every month I had it, it got slower and the connection got weaker. Just last night it failed and delivered a ping of 240ms and a download speed of 1.2 mbps. I thought my ISP was screwing me over but it was this cable the whole time. The months that it was functioning it out-performed my other Cat6 cables. It has CAT7 specs but poor quality control. I would steer clear and find a certified CAT7 on NewEgg or another website that doesn't just allow any brand to sell their products."
3.0,"This is a really nice, professional looking portfolio cover with a notepad at a great price.  BUT--there is NO protection or padding on the corners for your iPad.  I found this out the hard way.  Did not even drop it, just had it in my bag on a cold morning, put the bag down (gently--not dropped) while waiting, and the iPad was damaged on one of the outside corners--the corner of the iPad rests right on the zipper, so it's not only not padded, but on something rather hard.  So if you're putting it in a padded slot in a briefcase--GREAT, but don't expect this to really *protect* the iPad."
3.0,transaction was goo . But a friend had bought one and she told me she thought it very complicated to use. She is a computer teacher.  So I knew it wasn't for me and so I srnt it back.
3.0,"It fits, but there was a little damage on the edge and fingerprints leave smudges to look dirty. It looks nothing like the picture."
3.0,It stores data and does a good job at it. What else can you say about something that has become so common place in today's world?
3.0,"Best quality for the cost. Hands-down the most comfortable long-use headset I've had for gaming.<br />I use a 7.1 surround sound system for music with all the VoIP chatting on the headset.<br />This works fantastically!!!<br /><br />Edit after this 2nd pair decided to take a dump on me again. (5/26/16)<br />This is the 2nd pair that has not only shorted itself, but also shorted the USB in my 2nd unrelated motherboard that required me to reseat cables and power cycle the board praying that it didn't burn out the USB connector like my first mobo. I really really love the comfortable headphones, but it's severely disappointing to me that this is doing more damage than good at this point.<br /><br />Leaving this as 3-star since I may be an anomaly, but infuriating that I've gone through 2 now with the same issue on 2 different mobos."
3.0,Not gigabit
3.0,Not resistant to permormanse live or workof field
3.0,"After a great length of time using the Ceton card, it has been more of a miss than a hit. When it works, it's awesome. The quality of the video is better than that of the cable box recording for HD content as wel as standard definition. Also, being able to record 4 HD shows at the same time was a great feature. However, the card would tend to lose connection often. Despite all the support that Ceton provided and driver updates, it never really solved the drop in connections. Only by rebooting the computer does it seems to reestablish a connection."
3.0,"Tried to return to amazon, and I received a &#34;health and safety&#34; risk, no longer returnable.  That sounds kind of scary. The speakers seem ok, but they buzz out of the right channel sometimes."
3.0,made headphones sound tinny and seemed to have some potential shorts. Ya get what ya pay for! It was very cheap. I would advise paying a few bucks more to get a better quality product.
3.0,The tab on the front leaves a sticky residue. Why not have only the tab on the pull-off sheet.
3.0,"This keyboard is not a bad.  It does have a couple things wrong with it.  The letters on the keys are fading now after about 1 year of use.  Also, I didn't think the location of the question mark key would bother me that much, but I was wrong."
3.0,"The link to activate the router didn't even work anymore! I had to call their call center overseas in order to manually install the router. It works great now that it's set up, but what a pain!"
3.0,"However, SanDisk replaced it and didn't charge for shipping.  So I guess I'll wait and see how long this one lasts."
3.0,"I have been using these cables for 2 years now. At first, I would only need to buy a new replacement cable every 10-12 months. Just recently in June 2015 I purchased a replacement, but by August 2015, a mere two months, it was malfunctioning. My issue with the cables is the very common need to keep the cable at certain angle to get it to work, but it had never happened in just two months before. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me a free replacement, which I appreciated, but the problem was that the replacement was worse than the one I had complained about, needing an even more extreme angle of the cable to work. At this point I have just decided to switch to a different brand of charging cable.<br /><br />So overall:<br />~Points for being a usually very durable cable with good teeth on the micro usb that usually lasted me 10-12 months<br />~Points for the prompt customer service in getting me a replacement<br />~Reduction for the cable that was malfunctioning within 2 months and the replacement working even less"
3.0,"We've had it for a few weeks. It works. It has a background &#34;hum&#34; when there isn't anything being delivered. I'm not sure if it is the headphones or the computer I use them on, but I didn't have the hum with the other headphones I was using. Otherwise it sounds okay. We want some durability, and we won't know the answer to that issue for a while."
3.0,It does what it's supposed to. The base is heavy enough for normal wires. The unit I received looks a bit different from the picture so it is not quite as attractive as the display model. The only other issue was that it smelled terrible (like a strong industrial plasticy smell) for about a month after I opened it. The smell was strong enough that it filled whatever room the product was in and I had to leave it outside until the smell went away. Washing did not help at all.
3.0,"product arrived in good condition and appeared to be correct.  however, my wife found that this will not fit the Acer CB3-111 c670 that it is automatically suggested as an extra purchase with.<br /><br />returning... and have a disappointed wife."
3.0,too low of a profile for my taste..lower than it looks..and the pads on bottom are not the greatest..tracks roughly...otherwise it's good.
3.0,"DEFINITELY NOT WATERPROOF!  The off gassing is significant.  If I had known it was coming from so far away and take so long, I would not have ordered it."
3.0,Super cute!!!!! But only lasted 4 months before the sides starting tearing. Good for light users:) Fast shipping and delivery time:)
3.0,it makes a buzzing sound. it works though. i would recommend getting an original
3.0,"it needs more storage, kids like lots of games."
3.0,sometimes does not work
3.0,"The product protects the ipad nicely.  I hadn't considered its propping angle but having just one angle now instead of the 3 I had before I miss that option.  Although this one angle is more secure than the three I had before, so its a tradeoff you have to consider."
3.0,Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating.
3.0,wasnt able to use as its possible having issue with the hard disk supply unit
3.0,"Average product. Works as intended. The cover hides half the volume adjusting buttons on the ipad air, so that is a little bit of a pain."
3.0,not what i expected in sound quality
3.0,Been using for nearly a year and the smell is still overbearing.
3.0,"I purchased two of these tablets for my daughter. The first one functioned well but slow. The second one required you to hold the power button for ~12seconds to start and it frequently locked up. It worked well when it worked but I had to reinstall apps regularly. I also own two fire kindles, a Samsung Galaxy and an iPad so it was easy to see the difference in video quality.  It is a good starter tablet for a child."
3.0,Its o.k.
3.0,Good for the price. Loud at load.
3.0,The cord on it is too short and I am going to get another one with a longer cord
3.0,"Way too noisy, cooling is very good. If you are a heavy gamer with gaming headphone set, you can simply ignore the noise."
3.0,Upon hooking up the cable from my TV's USB port and my Firestick. I started up the unit while it did power up I kept getting a warning message of low. I then swapped the cable out with a longer micro USB cable and used the same USB port on my TV. Result is no warnings. Swapping back again I received the warnings again. I do not know why I am getting the warning but the Fire Stick appears to work just fine. It does(the cable) help on clearing up the clutter so that is why I marked it with three stars.
3.0,"The cover was not all red. The corners were black. I didn't like the way it looked.  I returned this item, but kept the black version. It does allow it to stand on the landscape side, but not the portrait side. I've had for about one month. It feels a little flimsy now. Still works."
3.0,Cheap but looks nice. One of the ears stopped working after a few weeks from the day I purchased it. Most likely loose contacts.
3.0,Nice bag. Good layout and and lots of internal and external compartment areas. Two complaints.  One is the out side zipper sticks in one area but has not jammed. Two the strap is fixed and you must untwist it before throwing it over your shoulder.
3.0,Works properly but has been harder to get used it.
3.0,"The only thing that I don't like about this case is, I don't think it's for an iPad Air 2. In order for me to get my volume to work I had break off a part of the case ."
3.0,Doesn't last as long as original battery
3.0,"The board is a cute idea. However the magnet is totally useless.<br />At first I thought the whole board itself is a magnet on the back so it could stick on the fridge. But it actually is for little magnet stick on the four corners of the board and after only one day, the board came off on the floor. They are not sticky enough to hold the weight of the board."
3.0,Received a defective one that did not want to format.  Returned it.  Bought a different brand instead although from past experience Sandisk has been fine.
3.0,"Does the job.<br />Pretty loud fan though, you can get better for the same price elsewhere."
3.0,"It worked well for only 3 months, and stopped charging.<br />Update: the seller replaced this item. I am now on my second charger. It is working fine. Will update in a few months if this one doesn't last."
3.0,After a few months of use the plastic broke. A little super glue fixed it but how long will it last.
3.0,Split screened as said for xp. Lags a lot.
3.0,interfers with wifi signal
3.0,"Bought to play Game of War on it, which of course would not run on it.  Otherwise might have been great, just not what I wanted it for."
3.0,While the drive is great the CyberLink that comes with it will not load onto my Windows 10 computer!
3.0,1 Faulty controller but they replaced quick. However batteries die very quickly. Analogs don't respond right away. And triggers already started going bad. Not bad for a cheap back-up. But would recommend buying an official ps3 controller for quality. This just enough to get by.
3.0,"For casual users, I think they will be ok with this modem. That said, I personally had an issue with this one. If you are a gamer, toss it to the curb. Every 5-15 minutes, my ping to, say Google, would go from 35 to 560 for about 3 seconds. ISP confirmed there were no issues with my connection. Crippling for any online gaming. Range isn't great either.<br /><br />I just replaced it with a Motorola modem. No more issues."
3.0,I'm having concerns about  the volumn  It goes all the down to a faint whisper after a short time in use. I'm going to use it to watch something at length and see if this continues.  If so I will return it for a new one. If this is necessary I will need a return label sent to me as I don't have a printer. Will be in touch.
3.0,"First the good:<br />The board was shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. It functioned exactly as described.<br />Now, the not so good:<br />As noted by others, there is absolutely no documentation included. Not even a marking on the board to tell you how to attach wiring to the relays. You have to completely rely on the Internet to get any info at all. Even direct inquiries to the Sainsmart website are met with days of silence followed by cryptic requests for more information. Useless.<br />I'm sure it's a great board for light duty in robotics projects, as long as the relays are activated slowly.<br />I intended to use it in a virtual pinball project to control feedback devices. (Mostly solenoids). This board is not up to the task for this application. Rapid input such as fast activation of flippers or jet buttons cause the board to freak out and stop reacting to incoming signals. I stops activating the relays and the only way out is to exit and restart Visual Pinball. There are better solutions that are made specifically for Visual Pinball DOF."
3.0,It's ok
3.0,Good. Life is shorter than 3 hours
3.0,Only lasted two years (less than the original) and now I have to buy another one. Maybe I will buy an original because the generics are not making the cut.
3.0,REALLY GOOD DID EVERYTHING I NEEDED IT TO
3.0,"Even though I generally use android tablets, I wound up returning this and bought an Ipad Air 2. At the end of the day, I was pretty displeased with the premium price tag, but poor build quality. I actually went through multiple exchanges and found all sorts of issues. One unit had the loose rubber backing. Another one had huge amounts of screen bleed. Another one came damaged on arrival. All in all, I was very disappointed. Lollipop did seem promising however."
3.0,Great display.
3.0,"Well, it does work and glad that it is not fake as you would get if you bought from other online stores at $50 a piece. But their max transfer speed is only at 18mb/s not 30 as advertised and I have a very decent desktop with usb3 connector."
3.0,"Why is it Logitech makes awesome keyboards and mice, but their headsets are just okay? Logitech, if you're reading this, you guys can do better. I always buy Logitech brand gaming peripherals, and while these are decent, I've already run into my fair share of issues with them, specifically the sound cutting out, and coming back on randomly. If you want a quality gaming headset, look elsewhere, if you want a budget gaming headset, these aren't too bad, but don't expect the best."
3.0,"HDMI came broken, but it worked fine otherwise.  I would suggest checking all the video input types when you get it.  I returned this unit."
3.0,Did not last long. Got 1 year out of it before it was at 25% life at full charge
3.0,STOPPED WORKING 1ST WEEK... WOULDN'T CHARGE- FROZE... SAD PURCHASE
3.0,Shipped quickly and is a nice fit. The only problem I have is that the magnetic keyboard doesn't hold in place well at all.
3.0,Seems to have some problems.  Freezes u.p Deletes messages at random..  Just downloaded latest version of operating system.  If this does not solve the problem will try Apple store.
3.0,was nice the 2 weeks it worked turned it one one day to use it and the screen came up with only lines. Working on a return with amazon. I do not like that you have to plug in and un plug the key board if the tablet has blue tooth capabilities I would think the key board would as well. I am having them replace it but would not recommend it as it lasted only 2 weeks. When it worked it was nice and worked well.
3.0,"Nice design but the interior stiching is not done well, so be carful when taking out the &#34;removable&#34; padding. The Velcro will pull out the stitching immediately. Mine ripped out the first time. The zippers could be higher quality. Wish I could give a better review, I like the look and design."
3.0,It does not hold the charge as much as I expected. if it goes on like this I have to return it
3.0,"This thing is mostly plastic with a few wires inside; at 33% of the cost of a new Nexus 7 2013 tablet, it is outlandishly overpriced."
3.0,"Hi dear, it was a great experience and a lot more than a dream come true. I appreciate the offer."
3.0,"Purchased to replace wrist strap on cane. From Amazon product pictures appeared that clasp holding strap to elastic piece was similar to key ring similar to the previous wrist strap. However, clasp is a ring with abutted ends. Installation was a bit difficult as I had to pry open the ends, slip through the cane post, then crimp ends closed. The strap works (and perhaps elastic allows for easier installation) however if you are purchasing to easily loop ring through cane post this strap is a bit more labor intensive than the photos suggest."
3.0,300 screws and not a single one I need.  They are screws and they are tiny.  I have a Sony Vaio notebook and needed to replace a few screws that have fallen out over the last year.  The description says Sony so I ordered it.  Well none of the screws are long enough for the one I needed to hold the DVD drive in place.  I got screwed.  But there are a lot of them .
3.0,As described.. love the feel and color
3.0,"I like it comes in handy fits good with my Galaxy S5 smartphone, no problem with filing data on a computer."
3.0,"This kindle has a lot of nice features like dual cameras, but I am not at all impressed with the speakers. I hooked up the kindle to an auxiliary speaker to listen in the car and could barely hear the audio book. Couldn't turn up the volume any higher. I also had a terrible experience with support and was told there was NOTHING they could do for me and that I would have to purchase a new kindle (this one) and did not have any discounts.Left a bad taste, especially since I have purchased 4 previous kindles for family members."
3.0,Very nice i i wll buy it again.
3.0,There are no screws or tape as described. Also does not stay together well. The top falls off easy.
3.0,"Good product, quick delivery."
3.0,I'ts ok for the money.
3.0,stopped working after 5 months. asus rma process is hit and miss. if you get someone who speaks english it goes ok. if not then not so much. when it was working it worked very well.
3.0,"Ok it is USB 3.0 on the outside, data transfer and recognition of USB 3.0 devices .... i better don´t start to curse here .... kept it because cheap and the buttons are great to switch on/off attached equipment like headset/camera etc. when needed. DON´T by tu use it for your USB 3.0 HDD or USB drives LOL!!!"
3.0,"It was great having a long cable and worked great for 2 months. I bought this June 17 and now on August 29 i am getting an error reading &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34; on my iPhone 6, and it stops charging.  I had the same problem with non-apple charge cords in the past so I was careful to check that this was 'Apple Certified' but now it stopped working again."
3.0,ok
3.0,I gave it 3 stars since it is a nice cable but it does have flaws. The actual connection is to long so it fits awkwardly into the micro usb port. Also it DOES NOT SUPPORT QUICK CHARGE. If your phone features the qualcomm quick charge 2.0 don't get this cable since it will only do a standard charge. Spend a little extra and get one from a brand called anker.
3.0,In my opinion it's difficult to use.
3.0,Chemical smell is too dense.
3.0,"I was excited by the prospect. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The instructions were less than clear, so I could not tell if the device was actually recording. I did get one recording from it, but since it is limited to 2 GB of output, about thirty minutes, it proved to be too difficult to be of real use.<br />The support staff was attentive, and really tried to help overcome the deficiencies, but, for me, it just didn't deliver as advertised.<br />Perhaps the use of their software would have mitigated the deficiencies, but it is only for PC, and not compatible with my Mac."
3.0,Not the best quality but the price isn't bad either
3.0,"It isn't as fast as the class10 I used before, and the file structure only allows 29.7G free to put data on.  I can see SOME loss, but I'm very displeased with losing over 2G of space!  That's a big waste percentage."
3.0,good price bad qaulity image.
3.0,NO COMMRNT
3.0,Works well enough so far but the slide just runs loose unless you snap it in place which is not as easy as it looks.  Could be a lot better designed
3.0,"As other people on here have mention, the separators in between some of the pockets started shredding a few months after I got this thing. It's great how much space and compartments it has for the price, but it doesn't hold up for very long. Also the little side mesh pockets are too small to fit water bottles into"
3.0,I just got it Let u all know if it works ...in 6 hrs to full charge
3.0,"The mouse is alright; clearly a cheap Logitech clone; vastly inferior build quality - which is fitting for the price point to a certain extent.<br /><br />Mine works alright for now, but shipped with a broken internal part - an internal clip of some kind that snapped off (Image: http://bit.ly/1LFh0mu), that I had to shake down to the butt of the mouse and out through the open battery cover.<br /><br />So, I'm giving it 3 stars because it's \\""okay\\"" - it seems to work well enough; but the build quality is immediately disappointing. The broken clip I had to shake out of the mouse's innards put me over the edge here. That's immediately shoddy."
3.0,"windows10 is annoying, HUGE CALCULATOR to take up an entire screen...like who needs that? what happened to the simple straight to point calculator? why the flamboyance? yuck!!"
3.0,"I ordered this a while back for my husband. He's a die-hard Fate Zero fan. He absolutely loved it. It's the perfect size for phones, which is where he put his. My only complaint about it is the adhesive wore off after a bit, and he kept slicing his fingers on the decal as it was peeling from his phone. Other than that, it was totally rad."
3.0,Works good
3.0,"Original battery holds up to 7 hours, but this only holds up to 3 hours..."
3.0,U can hear but can't see anything
3.0,Destroyed to easily
3.0,"The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn't, and it's forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple."
3.0,Fits the computer. Would not keep it safe if the computer were to fall on concrete but protects against scratches.
3.0,It good but it falls out unfortunately.
3.0,"It was OK, but it didn't suit my needs."
3.0,"Material feels durable, but not confident that the screen will stay protected since my child can touch the bare screen through the case, instead of the case having plastic to avoid fingerprints and having something drop on the screen. May be returning this item."
3.0,"Well even though it is exactly the same part number as the old dvd it doesn't fit, physically different.  I wonder if the old one was modified and this is entirely the wrong part. Eventually the old DVD failed entirely. I tool this to the basement and modified the sheet metal to match the other also modified DVD and installed it. It is not a perfect match still but it plugs in and works. Up to 3 stars from 2 since I shouldn't have to modify a part that was supposedly made for the computer."
3.0,I love this mouse but the usb adapter is bigger than it should be and got bent in my backpack (i connect it to my work laptop). Now my keyboard and mouse don't work!
3.0,"Surely it generally does what it claims to do.  Although, beware: if you have intentions of plugging your keyboard into it, the USB ports on your keyboard basically become useless.  All-in-all, it's a nice, handy product but it definitely doesn't fit in seamlessly with the iMac and/or its accessories such as the optical super-drive.  Apple products are indeed metallic but they are matte-finished with a higher-end look while this product is glossy with a plastic look.  Oh and it won't lay flat on your desk if you have a 27&#34; iMac like me -- you'll have to put something like the optical super-drive under it."
3.0,"I don't get too worked up about memory cards, usually try to buy at least class 10. I am sure this is a fine card, just the one I purchased was defective.  Replaced it with another brand, not wanting to try twice."
3.0,"It's a good product, and inexpensive enough to buy more than one. The plastic screen cover is too rigid and makes it difficult to use portions of the screen. The stand never wanted to stay on, and after putting it back on ten times, it just gave up altogether.<br /><br />Otherwise, my kids have dropped the iPad and it has survived those spills. It does what it's supposed to do."
3.0,"If you're never going to be more than about 10 feet from the receiver, then you may never have a problem with this little unit. It should work exactly as advertised. However, once you get about twelve feet away, or worse, about 15, then you're looking at annoyingly intermittent reception of telemetry. I have this plugged into my HTPC, and if I need to click on something that doesn't take up 10% of the screen, I have to use my Logitech wireless mouse, because the &#34;airmouse&#34; is so ridiculously buggy at the distance my couch is from my computer. The rest of the features on this thing work well enough, especially at close range, but the airmouse feels like something better suited to a knock-off of a Nintendo Wii. Additionally, the hotkeys for the controlling media functions, like pause/play, fast forward, reverse, require pressing 2 keys, which are on opposite sides of the keyboard. If you have 2 free hands, that's not a problem, but if you're trying to be slick, and use it like a fancy, new-aged, next-gen, intuitive remote control, then you're out of luck. Maybe the next iteration of this decent device will see an additional Fn key situated on the side, where you could press it with a finger, while you hit the media function keys with your thumb."
3.0,its not working as well as i hoped
3.0,This didn't provide me with the distance I needed. My neighbor and I share our internet (there is a bout a 15 ft distance between our houses) and the router was positioned next to the window. I can pick up the internet just fine with my laptop and download 1-2mb's easy. My PS4 would keep disconnecting and it would go in and out even when hardwired in the Nighthawk. Just can't justify spending this about of money in when it's not giving the boost it describes.
3.0,"Softwear freezes repeatedly.  It doesn't interact with other apps. Otherwise, great size."
3.0,"When I first inserted the card in my computer it wouldn't recognize it.  Had to &#34;jiggle&#34; it around in the card reader, and then it took a long time for my computer to finally recognize something was there.  When I tried to read and/or format the card it kept telling me &#34;There is no disc installed in removable drive E&#34;.  I wasted a lot of time trying to find a cause/fix before I tried a different SD adapter.  As soon as I changed adapters the card worked perfectly."
3.0,Great at first but didn't last long. The teeth that connects to your phone wouldn't stay in the phone after a couple of months.
3.0,Met expectations but quite noisy.
3.0,"I really love the color and it fit really well on my MacBook Pro,  and the price was really great it just didn't last very long before it broke"
3.0,So far it's works good
3.0,No comments
3.0,Does' it's job but chord is too short
3.0,A lot bulkier than I expected.
3.0,"when it did work it worked well, one day it just died 3 months after I bought it. I know these thinks happen with any memory card, it happened to me on another card I had, but that is another story. luckily sandisk has decent customer service, and will send me a new card, they were actually easy to work with, I contacted them through email, hopefully all goes well that ends well"
3.0,I bought a white one and a black one. The white one works perfectly but I'm having problems out of the black one.
3.0,Awesome lights and I love the color.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the switch placement is terrible for use with most motherboards.
3.0,Fyi my pc has bsod alot since i got these a few months back. I dint think of returning them becouse i dint think it happened enough but oh boy was I wrong. I shoulda stuck with my old RAM and not look for bargain stuff. I cant say 100 percent but ive reasearched the Bsod NS Hd mem dumps and 80 % have been RAM issues. Only thing that changed was the RAM.Been using my old ram for close to two maybe three months not a single BSOD. done goofed up
3.0,It's ok. It's a lil slower than I expected.
3.0,good
3.0,It's a nice tablet. I got it for school and it works OK so far. The only thing is that it glitches sometimes and will randomly bring you to s voice which is annoying. Also the on and off button works only when it wants to making it difficult when you want to turn it off. Lastly it takes crappy pictures by that's not super important.  All in all its ok especially for the price.
3.0,"I just received this product and I was delighted. Although my Kindle Fire HD 7 fits in this case it doesn't seem as if this keyboard is compatible. But I do still think that this case is of good quality. I will try to get a refund and by looking at the other reviews, It seems as if the customer service of this product is reliable."
3.0,I must say I was shocked at how fast I was able to unlock a lock easy to use and cheap it's a very simple tool
3.0,delivery time is perfect.quality is good eventhough not perfect.
4.0,"I have a love-hate relationship with screen protectors.  I cannot help but get frustrated when installing them.  They attract dust, yet the goal is to avoid dust getting under the screen protector.  I swear that is why they always sell you more than one at a time.  The first one just collects all of the dust so that the second one has a chance.  I was very frustrated after the first one, but with the second one there was only one speck of dust and the usual air bubbles.  I was able to work out most of the bubbles right away and thought I could live with one bubble around that spec of dust.  To my surprise, all of the bubbles in the display area are gone, a few minor ones near the edges, and the bubble around the dust is so small I have to strain to find it.<br />Pros:<br />You get two so that hopefully one of them makes in on without too much dust under it<br />Does reduce glare<br />Only marginally affects tactile response of touchscreen<br />Appears to work bubbles out on its own<br /><br />Cons:<br />You'll be cursing at how much dust it attracts.<br />I'm not an expert and I can't do a side-by-side comparison, but I think there is a little loss in clarity, but I knew that going into it and I think the glare reduction is worth it (glare was a distraction for me).<br />The cloths that came with it are poor. Use others<br />Don't use the tape they provide to try to pull dust off of anything - it left adhesive marks on my screen and failed to remove the dust from the protector.<br />Don't keep pulling up the screen protector to try to remove dust, see point above<br /><br />Oh, and shipping only took like 2 weeks from China, so not bad and well ahead of the planned delivery date."
4.0,"Nice, fast little &#34;phablet&#34;.  The screen is bright and crisp compared to other low cost Android tablets.  I used it as an HUD display for my car and worked perfectly."
4.0,for my son
4.0,Love the look and feel of this case.  Very slim profile.  Maybe it's just new and stiff but the standing feature is a challenge for me to get positioned correctly.
4.0,Wonderful for kids.
4.0,"This is a decent laptop fan. The build quality is basically feels really flimsy and not all that great, but it looks cool and I like the blue LED accent. There's 2 rotary dials in the back, one for the top two fans, and the other for the bottom two. However, if either dial is cranked all the way, all 4 fans will turn on and light up. I prefer to run fans like this at full power, so I don't mind the wonky power dials. The fans are powered by a full sized USB cable, which is included. Bonus - there's a USB port on the back so I don't lose a port just because of these fans. They function quietly and give decent air flow. There's two feet that angle the fans and my laptop, but the angle feels far too extreme to be of use to me. I think the price is a touch too high for what it is. I was given this free in exchange for an honest review."
4.0,We live in a small ranch and needed the wifi to get from the furthest point.  It works.
4.0,I wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so I chose this SanDisk microSD card.  The card has worked perfect so far in my HTC One M8 for several weeks so far.  The performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate.  The performance is likely limited by the phone's USB 2.0 interface so I haven't done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated SD card reader.
4.0,Does its job.<br />Kinda tight until broken in but it is good.
4.0,"A bit expensive, but does what it should. I run two Zyxel access points off these and they work with no problems."
4.0,For the price gets the job done. Ended up tossing the keyboard cover- it smudges my screen.
4.0,Very good product at a good price and I had it in my hands in no time flat.
4.0,My husband bought this and said he likes it. He likes the clear window panel and fits his needs for mid size gaming tower.
4.0,"Works great in my Samsung S4 phone. Being class ten it is designed to write quickly, but somehow my phone's internal storage is faster: minus one star.I have been using this for about a month with zero data loss or other problems."
4.0,"I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!"
4.0,good value
4.0,Great Product. Easy to clean and keeps my computer cool!
4.0,"its not 5 stars because the battery life sucks. once in a while i have problem connecting while wireless. mine is still in perfect condition after 1 whole year of use and i game a lot, but its just the connection issue and battery life issue."
4.0,Works just fine in my tablet
4.0,I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.
4.0,"A good quality memory for smartphones and tablets,  comes with adapter for pc too"
4.0,Have had this for a few weeks now and it's worked perfectly so far. For the price you can't beat it!
4.0,"This a great card with lots of storage for the money. Don't hesitate in buying this, it's a steal for the amount of storage you get."
4.0,"I like this screen cover, but it was impossible to get all of the bubbles out. Again, it is a great looking screen cover, you just might have to get a bit creative to get it completely smooth."
4.0,works good.
4.0,great deal
4.0,"perfect fit,but does not stick"
4.0,Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven't had any data loss or other issues.
4.0,"While the class 10 speed is excellent (it's amazing when files will initially transfer at 200MB/s before settling down to ~19), you do need to use a reader with proper SDXC support, and manually format the card in a good partitioning program, like minitools or easeus. That alone should disqualify it from 5 stars, for lack of user-friendliness. But if it weren't for that, the fast, roomy card is a wonder to own."
4.0,Very quiet.<br />Moves the air nicely.
4.0,good
4.0,Very quiet and it keeps my cpu cool even under loads like gtaV
4.0,It took a week to get it delivered but it kit was new and worked great.
4.0,"Great service and quick delivery.  However the product itself, though compatible with my laptop, can only charge to 95% and does not seem to provide the same charge life as the OEM.  Suits my purposes though."
4.0,Nice product. Relatively easy to install although the instructions are not intuitive.  Also there it is difficult to tell direction to physically place the screen protector.  The material seems very sturdy although have only had it for 5 days.
4.0,fit well as others have said connector is a little bit to long but other than that pleased with product
4.0,What I was expecting
4.0,"I like this mouse it works well, but is smaller than I would have prefered"
4.0,"Perfect for your needs if you don't require much. Holds charge well, great display, ads aren't too invasive."
4.0,"This is a nice keyboard, but it is extremely small and won't work as easily for people with bigger hands."
4.0,Good except no on /off when using the cover.
4.0,"Like the tablet and what it does, but its quirky and that is frustrating.  Especially concerning startup."
4.0,Great bag set. I get so many compliments. Few people also made a purchase. It's durable. But compact.
4.0,"Does what it should do. Packs a lot of features and reasonable screen quality in a very attractive price. Not very fast but hey, what do you expect for 40 bucks."
4.0,"Once I got less powerful batteries in the mouse, it worked great. I'd recommend buying cheap batteries (no big brand names). The mouse doesn't work with the more powerful batteries, for example, it didn't even turn on with Duracell. I like that it's small and light enough to pack in my work bag and turns off when it's collapsed."
4.0,good product
4.0,I bought these for my wife's computer.  She is Russian and it helps her when she types using some of the Russian language programs on her computer.  I had purchased these before for an older computer and she used it for a couple of years without any of these coming off or wearing out.  But when we replaced it she now has a new wireless keyboard.  They show up nice on black keys; they come in other colors for gray or light keys.  A nice item that makes life better for the wife; and you know that helps!
4.0,Worked as advertised.
4.0,"The price was right,  I bought two of them,  Of course i'm wishing they'd last longer but in reality i'm not complaining.  They came quickly three day delivery was plenty fast enough."
4.0,"The case fits perfectly and has protected my phone from several small drops. I don't think it would survive a serious impact or a toddler, but for the average mildly clumsy adult, the case provides great protection. The textured side makes it easier to keep a grip on the phone.<br /><br />This case is an excellent value. I wish it came in other colors, but I appreciate that it doesn't have a window on the back to show the Amazon logo like so many of the other cases that are compatible with my fire phone. Because seriously, Amazon - let's dial down the neediness a little, shall we? I don't need to advertise your product every time I use it."
4.0,Heats up. But works perfect for the price
4.0,"been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it's a memory card."
4.0,This works great and has kept the screen free of scuffs and scratches.
4.0,Works well however it seems to come out of the socket very easily so if bumped it goes flying.  Luckily I am using it as a power hub sitting in my basement to jacks that I installed in my kitchen.
4.0,"They worked with me and price matched the product, which I greatly appreciated. I really like the look and feel of the case. I ordered the mint green. It doesn't look cheap like some of the other cases that I ordered and then returned. The only thing that bothers me is that it picks up fingerprints very easily. My case has a lot of smudges on it now, and it's a hassle to constantly have to clean it. Even so, I would recommend this case."
4.0,its on
4.0,Works great.  I'd recommend it.  Easy to install.  No issues using it for about 2 months.
4.0,"Can't be beat for the price. A lot of claims about being under powered but I can run GTA V in full 1080P with mixed high and normal graphic settings. The only flaw, and is common for budget cards, is the fan is a little loud."
4.0,"I bought this SD card for my android phone thinking that a class 10 will be faster and more reliable than others. it turns out, the difference in class doesn't really matter at least for Android phones. didn't really worth the price difference"
4.0,A+ purchase...can't beat the price!
4.0,"First off, companies need to mark these right, they consider 1000mb to be 1 gig, when 1 gig is actually 1024 mb.That means you will end up with 62 gb &#60; and in all actuality it will read as 59 gb in your device &#62;other then that this card works awesome. I would highly recommend it!one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data."
4.0,Love this 32gb micro sd card. I put it in my Samsung Galaxy Note phone. I just returned from a 3 day trip where I used it as my camera/video recorder. I kept it on HD quality the whole time. No problems at all. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. If that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance!
4.0,"Relative needed a new sd card, an upgrade from her 8gb and this did the trick. Great for any phone."
4.0,"Very nice cover for the ipad air, great product."
4.0,"handy little flash drive, but the hinge doesnt seem like it will last forever... to be clear it hasnt broken on me, but I wouldve liked the hinge to be more substancial"
4.0,good product
4.0,"You guys literally brought my S3-391 back to the road!.<br />Although the instruction manual has no instructions at all, and its limited to warnings about avoiding nail the battery ( I still wonder the reasons behind someone would like to pierce a lithium container after all). I've never changed an internal battery, but that's not a real problem, just being careful and half and hour and it's done.<br />Also, the packaging is not that great, just foam and soft paperboard. I expected something more secure to transport a laptop component, it's not a critic, just a suggestion, maybe some bubble wrap and anti-static bag would be better.<br /><br />Finally, I had to ask a good friend of mine who made a business trip to the US to recieve the battery, cause BTExpert does not supply this product as international shipping item. This made some issues to set a specific adress and I was a little concerned because the product became disappeared a few days at the location, and my friend had to contact to USPS to ask for the person that received and signed to the delivery. I'm not against paying for int. shipment, but BTExpert even does not allow the option.<br /><br />In spite some issues, I recomend the product."
4.0,DID NOT NEED IT
4.0,Great tablet but speakers are very quiet and not Loud
4.0,I never used this cover as gave the tablet to granddaughter. But it looked O.K.
4.0,Works well
4.0,"I got this for my Galaxy Note 3, as it accepts add on storage.  Works perfectly, and I use it to store all my music and files so I dont junk up the phones memory."
4.0,"Works well, is about the size of your hand, if not smaller. Works well but I wouldn't use it to play games."
4.0,Worked great. At the beginning one was a bit sticky in opening but it come around.
4.0,"Love it!! Very seldom does it give me any problems but, it was definitely a good buy. I can't seem to put it down because I am constantly reading. The apps I downloaded are great and work perfectly. I highly recommend it. *Be warned that it is small but don't let that defer you from purchasing one."
4.0,Very good option for the IPad for the price. Every one should have one of these.
4.0,Charger arrived very quickly and works just as advertised
4.0,"A fine product.  I've been using mine for over a year now, and it's never punked out on me.  I just bought another one, to use as a spare.  Delivered on time, reliable, priced fairly."
4.0,Wel made.
4.0,"The quality of the keyboard and mouse overall is great. The shape definitely helps your wrists and the keys have a god tactile feedback without being noisy. However the biggest negative with this is that the wrist pad starts turning white after a few months of use (possible due to skin oils) and doesn't really go off easily. There is no easy way to clean it and no instructions either. I used one of the alcohol wipes and that did a reasonable job, but for a keyboard at this price I would expect it to have a better quality pad."
4.0,GREAT ITEM
4.0,Easy use....self explanatory.
4.0,Its a little bit smaller than expected. But it is a child's back pack after all.  My grandson thought it was cool.  It appeared to be manufactured well.  Ask me i6 months.
4.0,"Got the card, took it out of the package, dropped it in my Samsung S4, rebooted and it detected it immediately.  No need to format or anything.  Haven't done any speed tests, but I haven't noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them, either."
4.0,"Good product, works great, and I like the holder for the charging cable underneath."
4.0,Works very well.  Would be nice if it had a hole in it to make it easier to charge while closed.
4.0,good product
4.0,Still working well after 2 months.
4.0,"Works very well for a non-power user.  Plenty sufficient for browsing, viewing videos, etc.  No need to spend more."
4.0,its nice...
4.0,This is the third one of these I've bought. Dog enjoyed eating the first two. The best value I've found for this item. No complaints at all.
4.0,Easy to use. I debated between this and the paperwhite. I read the most in bed so now I am wishing I had purchased the back lit paperwhite. I'm sure I will find a case for this one which has a light included or a separate light that will actually fit into the case.
4.0,smooth operation and handles detail work for Photoshop very well.
4.0,Nice product I recommend
4.0,"I did a ton of research before purchasing this. I had an ipad that just stopped working, and wanted to get a replacement --with a little more umph. Something I could use for more stuff, etc.  The apple laptops would have been ideal, but couldn't shell out the bucks. So looked for a windows alternative.<br />Overall very happy with this; have had it a couple months. They major (only really) issue that I have is that it indeed does drop a wifi signal a little too frequently. I saw that on previous reviews, and figured it was probably a local wifi problem--and maybe it is, but it is a problem. Upgraded to windows 10 thinking that might help, but not really.  It's not a deal breaker, as all you have to do is sign off wifi and sign right back on, but it is annoying.  (If there is a fix to this problem Id love to know it!)<br /> Aside from that, love how you can use the touch screen or mouse pad. I'm not a super-user, using it mainly for browsing, occasional documents, etc .  Fix the wifi issue and this is a VERY good small portable laptop."
4.0,it will perfect if come with 1 more dust filter at bottom
4.0,Just what i liked
4.0,"The technical side of the monitor is fine. It works well, everything goes as it should. My main issue is that the monitor does not sit parallel to the desk as cannot be repositioned in an easy way.<br /><br />When using two of these monitors in a dual-display setup, I have to work ridiculously hard to align them properly because of this positioning issue."
4.0,I bought this to use I'm my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet. So far so good. Simple put into microsd slot and began storing data on it
4.0,"I still recall the day I upgraded my 20GB Xbox 360 HD with a 100GB HD and thinking, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34; Fast forward 4 years, lots of Rock Band DLC and the ability to store full games to the HD and I find myself at about 90% full. Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process."
4.0,It does the work as supposed to
4.0,Tried this in my Gopro Silver camera. So for seems to work.Put card in Adapter to transfer files and had a very hard time removing it again. Will not try the adapter again with this card.
4.0,I bought this card for my Phone. It gave me the extra storage for my pictures and video that I needed.
4.0,"This does a very respectable job cooling, it keeps my i5-6600k nice and cool even at full load without having to spin too fast or make much noise.<br /><br />The downside is that it is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE to install in a confined space. If you are building a new machine with this I would strongly recommend installing this before anything else and probably before mounting your motherboard, otherwise this is a fantastic cooler for the price."
4.0,"Works well, as advertised. I like the Class 10 speed. Price was right. Would recommend this product to others. Thank you."
4.0,"This is really a 4.5 star review. Fits the new Macbook very well and looks like wool. It does add a little bulk to the Macbook, as the seams take up about 1/2&#34; more room side-to-side in a purse than a naked Macbook. Still, it is lightweight, attractive, and affordable. I have no plans to use anything else."
4.0,No problems so far.
4.0,"I had to return this and get another one, as the first was faulty. I hear this is semi-common.Must not have enough testing, i might suggest buying two and returning one if you are in desperate or sudden need of one of these chips, no matter what size."
4.0,"This card reader gets pretty good performance compared to the nominal ratings for the cards I tried in it.<br /><br />I was hoping that the part that swings around would act as a cover for the USB side when it was not plugged in.  It fails there -- the swinging part does not stay in position at all.  When in use, the part that swings around just gets in the way, and since it won't stay in place protecting the USB connector when the reader is not in use, I really don't know what good it does.<br /><br />At least the lid over the slots protects the cards.<br /><br />However, because the card is completely enclosed in this, high-performance cards tend to run quite warm.  I have not seen card failures from this yet, so I do not know how much it affects the cards.  The device itself gets warm too, even with lower speed cards.<br /><br />I do like that the light indicates activity."
4.0,all good!
4.0,Very useful when in the office or traveling. I just wish the cord were a wee bit longer.
4.0,Good price.
4.0,Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn't let me down yet and no errors.
4.0,"I am charging an iphone 5s with an apple adapter and it takes several hours to get a full charge. I am very disappointed in this charger.  Great customer service. They reached out to me and after expressing the issue I had with it not charging right, offered to replace it no problem. I am impressed with the service and feel better about trying another product."
4.0,"Perfect for someone with a small hand. Just plug in the remote sensor to the USB port and pair the mouse with mouse. Remember to press one of the buttons to wake it up after pairing.  I have this for a week now, it saves battery by automatically turn off the unit after a period of inactivity. (I did not time it.) You wake it up by pressing any of the buttons. Appears to be well built."
4.0,"First off, I've always bought Sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and Sandisk's lesser lines. I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer. I now kind of think if these things work 30 days, they'll probably work 5-10 years until they are obsolete. FYI:The Sandisk and Sony are both made in China."
4.0,Nice
4.0,"Like it a lot, however, the wrist portion isn't holding up as well as I thought it would.  Has gotten pretty squished down but I've had it almost a year.  Still like it."
4.0,I purchased this product for a discounted price in order to give an honest review.  I have a 2015 Macbook Pro and it works with it.  It easily connects ethernet cables to my usb port!  My Macbook doesn't have an ethernet port so this product is very handy!  I definitely recommend it.
4.0,"Totally satisfied with display right out of the box -- color, brightness and contrast are great.  Will probably play with customization later, then again may not bother.<br /><br />Installation was annoying.  Comes with the now-common 1-page sheet with pictures on it and no written instructions.  I disconnected old monitor and plugged in new one, the background graphic popped right up.  But that was all.  No icons or taskbar.  Put in installation CD and nothing happened.  Opened File Explorer to try to manually run set up but still nothing on screen except the background.  Fortunately had a laptop handy so was able to access the User Manual on the CD.  Its install instructions mentioned that it was important to turn on computer AFTER turning on the monitor, something the simplistic pictures on the Quick Start Guide didn't even hint at.  But that was the solution, this time screen came up normally with icons and all.<br /><br />Running the Viewsonic setup went smoothly until last step.  Got message that drivers couldn't be automatically installed, needed to do it manually.  Going into manual setup though, only option it gave me was to install Windows 7 & Vista drivers.  I'd recently upgraded to Windows 10, suspect this was the reason.  As everything seems to be working fine with whatever default drivers it's using, not a problem.<br /><br />Checked Viewsonic website to see if I really needed Win 10 drivers.  Couldn't get into their drivers download page, kept getting sent to a page-not-found screen which even mentions one reason you're there might be because they moved the content somewhere else.  Now hoping I never need to deal with their Tech Support."
4.0,"The case is what I expected.  Very similiar to my Otterbox for my Samsung Cell phone.  Gives the Kindle Fire 6HD a little more heft to it, and makes it easier to handle.  Also has the protective screen, which works well with the Kindle's touch screen."
4.0,"stil not getting the write speed as I need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card!"
4.0,Holds up well. Using in car for 7inch tab 4
4.0,The charge doesn't last quite as long as advertised but the light works well & clips onto my book making reading in bed enjoyable without disturbing my spouse asleep next to me.
4.0,"This is the first real tablet I've used with any success. I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected."
4.0,I've used Sandisk cards for as long as they have existed. These cards are fast and have the solid quality I expect from Sandisk. Recommend.
4.0,Very good
4.0,The only drawback that I can assign to these SD cards is the limit of a 5 year warranty unlike Kingston.
4.0,Pretty solid tablet thus far. Only about a week old and only freezes up a little bit every once in awhile. But everything mechanical seems to work fine. Especially for the price.
4.0,It's a good keyboard but there trackpad seems touchy and the keys slightly lightweight for my taste.  Also the range wasn't enough for cross room distances for the build I did - s0 it went back.  Replaced with MacAlly (Hackintosh build).
4.0,My fiance has had this in his tablet for almost a year now without a single issue. I feel that it's one of the best quality memory cards we've ever had. Make SURE you get the retail packaging and not the &#34;frustration-free.&#34; The retail packaging only requires one quick clip of the scissors and it's worth it to get one that is sealed in a package and not at risk to be damaged.
4.0,Good product
4.0,Does the job
4.0,Works better than expected.
4.0,Works great. Only problem is that if i put the card in a multi car reader it does not read the car. Has to be put in a SD CARD ONLY reader to work and be read by computer
4.0,It works in my Note 2 smart phone. I don't think there is much else you can say about it.
4.0,It has all worked as expected
4.0,Bought this for my new Samsung Galaxy S4.  It worked right away with no troubles.  Only time will tell. :)
4.0,Used it in an android phone. Worked fine and is decently fast. It did not quite reach the rated speeds but came close (could just be the controller that I am using).
4.0,Excellent
4.0,The M1210 doesn't see this unit as  producing sufficient power to charge the batter and produces a bios message indicating a 65W Dell charger is needed - but you can ignore the message and it works fine though it doesn't show that it is charging the batter (which I don't use anyway).
4.0,"I purchased this backpack for myself since I enjoy hiking often and my current bag isn't waterproof. The backpack had great straps for carrying lots of heavy stuff. I threw a bunch of water bottles in it, food, clothes, shoes, food for my dogs and more and there was still tons of room. It has a wonderful amount of pockets.  The bag was so heavy, yet still very comfortable to wear. It is indeed waterproof and rugged.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that the inside label has  a mistake on it. On the place where you put your personal info, there are marks on it for the number area, so that's no help if I happen to leave it somewhere. You can see that in my photos. This is why I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, I love this! I'll be using this backpack for a long time. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
4.0,"love the neat size and legibility. i do wish it had colour though. bought it thinking it would be good for graphic novels, books with art illustrations etc.  So less than six months later I've got a damaged screen, probably my own fault because i placed it in my bag without pulling the cover down. Something probably pressed against the screen and now i've got a blank area in the top left corner which basically makes it unreadable. Sigh. I need a new screen now."
4.0,"Really enjoying this system for what i bought it for, Basically email, social media, streaming Netflix to my TV.  I am NOT using it for any real business applications.  It seems lightning fast, simple and easy to use for what I am doing with it.  I did notice that on some TV shows that had a lot of dark clothing and backgrounds that the Black looked a little weird.  A backlit keyboard would be nice, but I knew it didn't have one going into the purchase so I can't ding it for not having one.  I would absolutely recommend, in fact I already have recommended it to some friends, and bought a second unit for my girlfriend."
4.0,"Works great with the RK3288 Android TV Stick and lets me plug in multiple USB items to it.  However, it did not work with the new Remix Ultratablet.  Not sure if it would work with other Android based tablets or not."
4.0,"Solid fit for automotive (bouncy) use, and perfect length for my application."
4.0,I have been playing with the Fire and seem to know how to do what I want it to do.<br />I really like my Fire.
4.0,Works great!
4.0,"I like it. I had a Kindle fire which lasted several years, so my expectations are high. So far it's been fine. I have noticed playing games it has a tendacy to not respond to touch at times. It passes seconds later but could cost you the game depending on what game you're playing. I have no other issues with it."
4.0,Product good but for someone who'snever used a screen saver before the iinstructions are very vague and I wasted two of them trying to figure it out
5.0,"Purchased my first iPad & ordered several different cases from Amazon to decide on the one I preferred best.  I was interested in this case, but after reading the reviews was concerned it might be a little too thick & clunky.  As a result, I ordered a thin smart cover case (Khomo Dual Super Slim) and another rotating case (Fintie) that looked very similar but for considerably less money.<br />My observations:<br />Khomo Dual Slim Case -- for me this was just to thin & did not provide the added protection of the Targus or Fintie. It was a Smart Cover & did put the iPad Air to sleep. If you don't want any bulk & no features except putting your case to sleep, this may work well for you. It has over 10,000 reviews & is well rated, but it's not for me.<br /><br />Fintie 360 Rotating Case -- looks very similar from the outside but clearly did not feel or behave like the Targus rotating case. It felt a bit less heavy and the grooves that allow the tablet to sit in landscape mode were not as deep, not as many grooves, & did not feel as stable in the groove when compared to the Targus. In portrait position, both the Targus & the Fintie are less secure in position when compared to landscape mode. The Fintie  tablet seemed a bit more wobbly in Portrait position than the Targus.  I use Portrait mode mainly for Face-Time.<br /><br />Targus case -- I have used this case for 6 weeks now & am certain I made the best decision for my needs!<br />Sleep mode does not hesitate when you close the cover. I appreciate the elastic band that keeps the case closed. I use a stylus touch pen that has a clip & leash (Friendly Swede available on Amazon) & I clip the pen to the band instead of using the provided sleeve because it's quicker & easier.  I could take or leave the business card holder. I probably would prefer if this feature was omitted and one more groove added.  Since it's there, I find that a business card tends to bend when you try to insert one. My work around is to insert an oldplastic (like credit card) gift card and then put in a couple of business cards on top. It slides easier. I can also insert a small microfiber cloth in- between these cards so it's there when needed.  No difficulty in rotating, although I do steady the tablet when in Portrait mode.  The stitching seems well done, no loose threads noted inside or out.  The corners seem well protected & it's easy to access the volume & power switches as well as charging port.<br />I primarily use Landscape mode & LOVE the fact that the tablet will stay in this position securely while I tap on the keyboard or use gestures on the touch screen. It is rock steady.  For my purposes, it is neither too thick, heavy, or cumbersome.  I appreciate the extra protection for this expensive device!<br />I would not hesitate to recommend this case & would certainly look to Targus for any future cases I may need to purchase."
5.0,"Decent price on 16 GB. Works as it should, no problems. Not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices. Maybe for transferring media to PC faster actually helps. Either way, it works great."
5.0,"I have been using it for over a month now, works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Excellent speed, Do recommend it."
5.0,"Excellent. Love the size, weight & speed. The swipe is a great bonus.  Haven't used the camera at this point, but trust it will be satisfactory. Have already recommended this Fire HDX to others."
5.0,This product works fast and is very reliable. The capacity is huge. I use it in my tablet and in my phone and can carry lots of pictures and videos. Highly recommended.
5.0,the best machine ever!
5.0,"It is as advertised, is in my Tab at the moment and have it about 75% full with no problems!"
5.0,"All i can say for now since i have yet to use them is, they showed up on time very fast, as well each came wrapped in a small paper packet that is small enough to fit in your pocket. Secondly If these are the right ones i believe they will be excellent since based on the info and exp. i know from other ones i have used. I got them as gifts for other people so i have not had a chance to notice much. Hope this helped."
5.0,I got 2 of these for training room displays. They look good and work great.
5.0,"Still working...fast. It's almost a mind-fart to think we can put this much (much more now of course) storage in such a tiny little space. Come on, I remember in the 90's when a 3 Gigabyte hard disk was $300!!! That was soooo expensive even considering inflation.This card, is much, much, much faster than my first 3 GB hard drive...sad...but cool...wait....ouch, headache!"
5.0,lots of memory and it come with the adapter that makes it easer to connect to your computer or other devices.
5.0,"I worried that I wouldn't like a smaller Kindle Fire, but I love it and the improvements that have been made."
5.0,I have always been pleased with the SanDisk products and this one is no exception. It works as advertised. I would purchase it again.
5.0,"it is an almost required piece for my Samsung tablet.  it was at a good buy. :-)it is easy to use, and easy to install."
5.0,"I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card."
5.0,Love it.
5.0,Works like advertised!
5.0,I have been using this cover for nearly 2 months and until now I have no any problem. It’s thin and besides the port for charging is easy to use. Great for the cost.
5.0,"I needed to get more space on the SD card in  my phone, so naturally! I turned to a product I know for its quality and attention to details.  I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again."
5.0,good~~
5.0,Edit: Changed my one star review to a 5 star review. Plugable support is unreal. They sent me two new working units to replace my two units that ended up being defective. Incredible. OUTSTANDING!
5.0,very happy w/product would buy again
5.0,"As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk!"
5.0,"I installed these on my Samsung Note 3 and S4 and have not had a single issue. Plenty of space for music, photos, videos, and apps."
5.0,"Works great, Plug & PlayLoads of room for whatever your needs are.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.Great card, Great price!"
5.0,What can you say? Intel is always solid. Great cpu.
5.0,"As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0."
5.0,"Samsung Galaxy Note can't read this card, have to be format in Fat32. Just Google the small program to do the trick. Work perfect."
5.0,"As stated above, and not a bad price.  Bought this thing in hopes of using it with my Ztpad C93 tablet, and it works like a charm.  The card is very fast for what it is and I have not had any problems with it to date."
5.0,"simple, easy and effective. great adapter"
5.0,Works well for the iPhone.
5.0,Bulletproof memory card!  Fast and decently priced.
5.0,"Purchased this item for a LePan TC970 tablet. All I can say is, &#34;Works great!&#34;Okay, and so I have to type 5 more words on this review so that I can post it."
5.0,"Inexpensive and works fine, almost no noise at all, I like the big and quiet fan that have, runs fine with my MSI Pc-Mate, i5 Intel, GTX 960 SSC, 1 optical drive and 3 HDD..."
5.0,Memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed.  I was very happy with the price.
5.0,"Great computer.  Pricey, but top notch."
5.0,"Had had this for about 6 months now and it's in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven't had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn't all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last."
5.0,good price for a 64gb card. purchased it to go along with the Hero3 camera. Just what I needed to complete the set
5.0,Solid high speed cables delivered quickly.
5.0,"Some people complain about SD cards:1) Not working fast enough2) Some android devices are acting slow3) Rooted phones do not boot from SD cards.This card is fast about 28 MB/s, removed all the lag from Android device. HDR video recorder have no delays between video recordings (Which usually happens with most of the cards on the market) and all android rooted phones I tried booted and worked.I really recommend this card for price and performance!Good luck and enjoy you purchase."
5.0,"One of the benefits of having an Android phone is being able to have external storage. I popped this in my phone, moved my apps over, and added some FLAC, movies, and more.I added a selection of movies, and then never watched them. Then I was on a flight across the Atlantic and everyone fell asleep around me, and I remembered that I had added all these HD movies! That alone justified the purchase.Do yourself a favor and add some extra storage to your phone/whatever."
5.0,I use this in my Canon digital SLR.  Has lots of memory and the quality of images are great.  No disappointments.
5.0,"With the adapter I can easily use it in my camera, tablet, desktop P.C. & &#34;Smart&#34; T.V. &#34;Es muy bueno&#34; !"
5.0,good quality cable
5.0,"Works great, have this connected from my Thinkpad X1 Carbon OneLink Docking Station to an Asus 27&#34; LCD running at 2560x1440.  No issues, image quality is perfect."
5.0,Replaced another brand Class 10 32 GB micro SD card for my phone.  I didn't know how bad I had it before I put this in and started transferring files.  It was so much faster than my previous one. I am pleased.No issues with delivery or description.
5.0,I take lots of pics with my phone (Samsung 4S) and this helps free up space on my phone. I've not had any issues with it so far.
5.0,"Did the job!! Very nice would purchase again, and would recommend it as well."
5.0,"Very nice, lightweight case. Did not want a heavy case after buying the nice, lightweight Air 2 iPad. Like that it turns off the iPad just by closing the case. Also stands up nicely. Did think it on the pricey side, though."
5.0,great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon
5.0,"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase."
5.0,"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend."
5.0,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
5.0,Works great with my Surface RT tablet.  Transfers to and from are very fast.  Great price for the size and speed.
5.0,Worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 perfectly. I finally have the space to take all my current digital content with me when I am on a plane.
5.0,"We have 4 of the 32GB cards in our cell phones and love them.  They offer plenty of room for pix, music, and videos and are fast to save and load from..  Someday, when I get my desired tablet PC, I will be getting another one of these for it!"
5.0,"Do you need memory? This is 32GB of it in a MicroSDHC package. If that is the format you need and if this is selling at a price you like, then just get it and get on with your day. You've probably got better things, like that old episode of Gunsmoke you've been meaning to get to, or a nice walk along a cliff face. Possibly even something else. The point is that memory shopping shouldn't take you a long time. You should just do it. The amount of time it's taken you to read this is way more time than one should ever have to invest in considering a memory purchase. Have a lovely mid-to-late-morning, whenever that might next occur in your vicinity. Cheers."
5.0,"I just received this device and put it through its paces. So far it's excellent! It is essentially the same shape as the Logitech MX 510 and Performance MX mice that I have used for years in a slightly smaller form factor. Even so, it fits my paw of a hand very comfortably. But the smaller size makes it easily stowed in a laptop bag. It uses one AA battery and a USB nano receiver which stores neatly and securely in the battery compartment when traveling. There is power button on the bottom for battery conservation when not in use. The scroll wheel is clicky, which I prefer, and there are side buttons for backward and forward paging in browsers.The sensitivity seems perfect to me but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Installation was trivial. Insert the battery, power on the mouse, insert the receiver,  and the drivers install automatically (Windows 10). It did not install any bloatware or additional crapware that must be manually disabled or uninstalled, as Logitech loves to do. Very clean and minimalistic.<br /><br />Time will tell if it stands up to moderate use or there are other warts. I worry that the battery cover compartment may be flimsy for repeated open/close to remove/store the receiver. However, so far this is flawless and the price is unbeatable. Exactly what I wanted. Recommended!"
5.0,I have a Samsung Note 8 tablet and by adding this 64 GB SD card it saved me quite a bit as I did not have to move to 32 GB internal disk - - Simply just slipped the 64 GB into SD slot and off we go.
5.0,"it's very fast micro sd card i use it for my mobile and gopro camera , sandisk is the best ever"
5.0,I love this card and it is super fast. Great for putting it in a tablet to keep it from slowing up. And it was $15 reg $70 gives me something to brag about too.
5.0,best cast ever
5.0,I got this card to supplement the built in 32GB in my Galaxy Note 3.  This card provides superb internal xfer speed on the phone as well as to the PC using the Note 3's USB 3.0 port.
5.0,"Can't beat the price and quality for the capacity. I always buy these chips from Amazon. SanDisk chips have worked well for me. No problems with read/right, no lost data."
5.0,Amazing how 64GB now fits on a micro card.  I added this to the ASUS Vivo Tablet to extend the memory and am very glad that I purchased it.  Working great and have always trusted ScanDisk!Great item......Great purchase!
5.0,Popped them In our Phones and they worked as expected.
5.0,Works great! Thank u! Great price too def be coming back!
5.0,Very happy with product
5.0,"Grate and fast memory, SanDisk is just top of the line."
5.0,"The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it's a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it's a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it!"
5.0,I got a note 2 and needed more memory  well this is the one to get. I have had no problems with it. Recommended
5.0,Great case! Would recommend.
5.0,"Simply works, what else matters?  Why does Amazon insist on a minimum number of words?  This is a simple product that works.  That' s all that needs saying."
5.0,"Twice the speed of the TWC WiFi and nearly twice the distance in reception. Remember to place it in a high location, in the middle of the house will work best. I run 2 AppleTVs I watch Netflix on 3 devices and best of all, I have the lowest tier internet speed. That's how good it is."
5.0,"This chip replaces my previously fried out offbrand microSD.  So far it has performed flawlessly.  If it fails, I will update the review.  I have a Droid RAZR M smartphone."
5.0,Thanks
5.0,This is a wonderful case
5.0,"I only use the Targus stylus.  I like the feel of it, the rubber tip glides smoothly and it has a title thing at the other end so I can clip my skinny lanyard type thing to it."
5.0,Works good!!
5.0,"So far so good, this card works fine in my LG Optimus L9. Its been about 5 days, and I've added 20gb's of music on it. I will update if this card fails me in the future."
5.0,"Good quality. I've been using it several devices (phone, tablet, and computer) with no troubles at all. Glad I chose this one."
5.0,"Works as desired. Received On Time, Perfect Packaging, Flawless.<br /><br />Only thing to note for customers, If you are having troubles, Upgrade your bios. It worked for me after upgrading my bios. No Issue with the unit itself.<br /><br />My First Purchase at Amazon, Fully Satisfied."
5.0,"I picked this SD card to add some more memory to my phone. This works great and transfers data quickly. If you are in the market for a new SD card, I highly advise you to buy this one."
5.0,"Works great in my Samsung phone. Fast Enough to not really notice it is here.Came with an app that  shows disk usage both on card and internally, as well as Drop Box. Slightly useful.===Update: 1 year later it's become completely unreadable by any device. I was about to throw it out until I noticed that the warranty on this is pretty good. Contacted SanDisk, sent the old one back, and received a new card in a week. Bugs me that it stopped working -- it went from working to completely unfunctional in about 2 days. During that time the devices were complaining about corruption every couple of times."
5.0,"Bought this for my Nook HD and it works perfectly without any problems.  I already used about 80% capacity with HD movies, and my Nook HD plays them flawlessly.  Very happy with the product."
5.0,"Plugged this little gem into my 1520 and now have a huge amount of memory for video, kindle downloads, and music."
5.0,"Could not be happier.  It's fast, works great, and I didn't have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I've been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product."
5.0,"What can I say? This card just works. I'm honestly not a fan of Sandisk since their 64GB Ultra MicroSD died on me soon after my baby was born. I lost several weeks of photos, and I was quite angry.To be fair, they did send a new one after I sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half."
5.0,"// , Works."
5.0,"As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great."
5.0,I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great!
5.0,"only can use 29g after formatted butwhat can you do, i still like it for my psp, works great fast!"
5.0,"32 GB SD Card works well, and the price was reasonable, very happy with purchase so far! Worth a try!"
5.0,Used this in my GoPro camera.  Works great.
5.0,This little SD card is pretty amazing.  It is really fast and there was no issues when installing it.  It even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular SD card.
5.0,"Cloned a 350GB, 7200 RPM laptop hard drive to a 1TB Seagate Hybrid SSDHD in slightly less than an hour.<br />Ran the software right from the enclosed CD.<br />I was able to seamlessly swap the new hard drive for the old afterwards and the system fired right back up.<br />This was done to upgrade the hard drive for a Dell i7 laptop running Windows 8 with 8GB of RAM.<br />Simplest and quickest cloning product I have used thus far."
5.0,Purchased for school district.  I haven't heard any complaints (which I would) so I can only assume that everything is okay.
5.0,Product as described.  Fast Shipping
5.0,Works great! My son loves being able to set farther than 2 ft from the outlet.
5.0,Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones.
5.0,Great deal
5.0,"Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference."
5.0,"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints."
5.0,It takes a few tries to figure out how to fold it correctly to stand up but it has grown on me as a light weight easy to use cover. It weighs a lot less than my old book style cover and is not so clunky when I am reading in bed.
5.0,The sd card works perfectly. I use a samsung galaxy s3 lte and the sd was recognized without problems. I did not need to format sd. Just plug and play.Ups sent me the shippment in 3 days. I recommend the product and the provider.
5.0,I am using this item to extend the Memory Capacity on the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet. Very good price with free shipping(Order &#62;$35) and it works as advertised!
5.0,"This  micro SD is very fast, I use it in a Samsung Galaxy Note II and I don't have any problem regarding low speed."
5.0,"This arrived quickly and was the actual product that was described, unlike what others committed about this item.  It works and does just what I needed it for.  Thanks."
5.0,Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!!
5.0,works fine
5.0,"We always come straight to Amazon for our memory card needs, and SanDisk is one of the reliable names in this category.  Lots of usable memory for minimum cost outlay so there is no downside to this product. Max out storage on your compatible devices!"
5.0,"Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all."
5.0,"awesome, fits macbook air 13&#34; perfectly"
5.0,Perfect size for all of our portable paperwork.  We keep everything in it that we'd need if we had to leave the house quickly.  It carries it all.
5.0,"PROS.1.-Bigest memory in a microSD card (64 GB).2.-You have to FORMAT it with a modern device, if not you'll have only 32GB. If you format it with a modern device you'll have 60GB (the 64GB is impossible, or at leats I couldn't).3.-Even if your device says ""maximum microSd memory 32GB"", this memory 64 GB card can works. I tested on Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0, Galaxy SII and SIII, Galaxy Note II (phone), Galaxy Note 10.1 (Tablet) and on all Asus Transformer. It works fast and perfectly in all of them.CONS.1.- Just the price but you already have plenty of offers. I waited patiently and finally I bought it for $49.9 (incredible!)"
5.0,"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it"
5.0,"Buying two of the 32GB cards is even cheaper than buying one 64GB, too. It's a really is a solid value."
5.0,"with games being 1-2 gb now a days this card is great for storing all my high graphic games on my note 2 and with the extsd2intsd mod it all goes to my sd card, but thinks its my internal storage which is exactly what i needed."
5.0,"Great product, bought it for a mini oscilloscope"
5.0,Great network adapter. Does 5 GHZ speed and works on Windows10
5.0,I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.
5.0,Good transfer speed
5.0,"I am using sanDisk SD card for all my devices. Cellphone, Tablet and PC. What can I say, this product is one of the best!"
5.0,"I had been using a 'regular' SanDisk 32GB Micro SD card that came included with my HTC Thunderbolt I bought in 2011. The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed... Anyway, bottom line on this product: AWESOME."
5.0,"All I can say is that if you need a new SD card, dodn't hesitate to buy this one.  Great deal and it works perfectly."
5.0,I forgot I had I a SD card in my device. It's a seamless part without hesitation. Micros are hard to remove but that is a device flaw
5.0,"I purchased this product to install in my Garmin GPS unit, since it was full and couldn't handle the new map updates. Easily and securely installed, this memory card promises to provide a long life to my GPS unit."
5.0,exactly as described and works GREAT on our Surface Pro's.  Excellent product!  Have never lost any data on one.  TARDIS
5.0,its a good Book its working fine.
5.0,Made well. Like looks and style
5.0,Works as it should and have not had any issues with it so far. I also was able to purchase it here for much less then Wal-Mart.
5.0,Speed of processing the photo or video to be saved is good.
5.0,I love this Micro SD Card. I'm glad I bought it and I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I have never gotten any errors with it so far or failures.
5.0,"32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time."
5.0,"I like the cool sound it makes when your computer starts up.  This mouse has stood the test of time, nearly 4 years after I bought it, still works flawlessly.  I like the length of the cord and the fact that it's fabric wrapped makes it really tough yet flexible."
5.0,"I really like these SanDisk Ultra microSDHC Class 10 cards.  I have several and when I see huge price drops I pick them up for phones, cameras, GPS' as well as tablets, on which I store video files for traveling.  I've never had a problem with a SanDisk."
5.0,"Put in the lumix camera and it works fast and great, no complaints, never had any issues, highly recommended, this brand always comes through  ."
5.0,it was a gift for my mother in law and she said she loves it!! so win win
5.0,"Fast little memory card. Affordable, good quality. Will be quadrupling my storage space on my device. I never seem to have enough of these"
5.0,This item is what it is; I've been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems.
5.0,Great buy and cheaper than most stores. Fits my Galaxy S3 perfect for my music and photos. Fast speed and functionality.
5.0,Actually was better than I had expected.  Very functional.
5.0,"great card, haven't had one crash yet.  for $20 you can't go wrong with the 32 gb sandisk memory card."
5.0,"Yes they are ugly, but these are the best fans out there. Great static pressure fans for my case"
5.0,Great product with enough capacity and it delivers performance. I am happy with this product on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone.
5.0,Gives me more time and memory when I'm riding with Shiftn Steel Sport Riderz and want to get some great footage
5.0,"I've never had a problem with Sandisk memory products (I use their &#34;ultra&#34; compact flash for my other camera), and this one is cut from the cloth. A great product with no problems... I will continue to demand Sandisk!"
5.0,Just what I needed for more storage on my phone. Don't know why but I've always bought the SanDisk brand and always been happy with the product. I have a few of these in varying sizes.Deb
5.0,"works great,no problems whatsoever.thanks."
5.0,"Good value for the money, shipping was a little longer than I expected, but it was worth the wait considering the price.  works great with my go pro hero 3 black edition."
5.0,Great product at a great price - working perfectly.
5.0,Bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works perfectly.  Price was better than anything I could find in the stores locally.
5.0,"What is this thing? Oh, yeah. A memory card!It does what it says and nothing else.Keep remembering things even when you forget. Like my last girlfriend!"
5.0,great one i like it
5.0,"Perfect card.  I have it in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and its fast.  no delay in pictures/video writing, and I think I may get a second just to keep on hand."
5.0,"Hard to believe that 10 years ago you would have needed a big hard drive to have this much room. I use this card in my Samsung Y Duos Smartphone and it provides more than enough room for my entire music library, a bunch of movies, and all of the apps for my phone and I still have more than 3/4 of the space left.Works perfectly and I've always had good luck with SanDisk products."
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT
5.0,I found this mouse very comfortable under my hand. This is what I was looking for at a good price..
5.0,The cards have had no reliability issues at their required tasks  so I did not put them under any data transfer time observations
5.0,Still works like a champ in my Pfsense box.
5.0,Works as expected.  High transfer speed.  Nice to have extra microSD adapters lying around since I always seem to misplace them.  Mainly bought it to use in my Nikon DSLR since I can put the card directly into my (CM modded) Nook HD+ tablet in the field and view my images on a larger screen.
5.0,"Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you'll like it!"
5.0,I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly.
5.0,"Love this case, this is my second on I purchased for my kiddos :)"
5.0,I've purchased 3 of the 32gb cards now. One each for my Galaxy S3 and my wife's. Also one for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.The cards are super fast and there have been no problems. The one in my S3 has been in it since they came out last year no issues at all.I purchased a 16gb for our Roku2.You can't beat the quality and price.
5.0,great
5.0,Not all memory cards are the same.  Class 10 means faster transfers.  This one is even faster.  Works as promised.
5.0,Works great and is very fast.
5.0,"I have tried to copy out the files and it is an astonishingly 40MB/s  Not sure why others are getting such low speed read but it think it is the computer.  Mine is running Core i7, SSD and 16GB ram.  Probably it is why so.  Nevertheless, will see how durable is this microsd card."
5.0,"I always like to have reliable, high speed memory, and this is exactly what I needed for my smartphone."
5.0,"Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple!"
5.0,Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user!
5.0,in my Samsung note 2. fast no delays. transfers data in fon and to pc immediately. Good value for a top rated card.
5.0,"Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps."
5.0,when I got my phone I didn't know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it
5.0,Very nice product. The memory works perfectly and it is exactly what i was waiting for. I recommend it 100%
5.0,Easy to setup and install. Only concern is my past history with Netgear products which use Coax. They are very sensitive to power surges. Fingers crossed they've fixed that issue. Never once had a problem with Motorola/Arris modems.
5.0,"Came in very handy for the trip i was taking the week that I bought it. Nice size for travelling. I honestly need to sit down and read more about how to use it, but have not done that in the 3 months I've owned it because it was very easy to charge it up and start using it without any instruction. I do find that the charge runs down very fast, much faster than on my 4 year old IPAD. But I simply just plug it into the charger each night and have no problem. The price was great , $165 , no tax no shipping, and I see that it currently is down even from that low price."
5.0,What else to say about this Sandisk Ultra 64 GB micro SD XC ? just perfect as all Sandisk cards
5.0,"Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Fast and dependable, no problem with viewing videos from it on the Note 10.1.  Try it you will like it!"
5.0,"I bought this 64 GB unit for my new Samsung Galaxy S IV. I wanted the maximum size for music and the copious number of pictures i take of my kids and other things.I like the read and write speed on this card. I like the size but would have been happier with a bigger card but this is the max for my phone.Always happy with SanDisk, you will not be sorry you paid a little more.Edit: Should not have put ""they have never let me down"" in the title! 3 months in, I have been having problems with the SD card slot on my Galaxy S4. Not sure if it is the phone or the SD card moving in the slot. T-Mobile have sent me a new phone so we shall see.Edit 2: 4 Months in and I am having more problems with the same card. I received a new phone from T-Mobile and the same problem continues to occur. I have formatted the card twice and this gives a little time before the problem reoccurs. I have spoken to SanDisk and will call them again to have this card replaced. I will let you know how this goes."
5.0,"Good price, good quality. Put it in my phone for some extra storage, and it's held up very well since I got it."
5.0,"Can't comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I'll update."
5.0,These work great in a GoPro Hero 3+ Black.
5.0,Sh.. do yo hear that? No? Exactly! Great fan.
5.0,"Got this for my girlfriend for the tablet I bought her, she love this as she can now put all the music and pictures on her tablet that she wants and doesn't have to worry about running out of space anymore."
5.0,"Very satisfying purchase.Needed to increase  the storage capacity  of my Core i5 Samsung Series 7 Slate PC which was EM equipped lwith a 128GB SSD.  This 64GB memory card fit the bill perfectly. Did my research. Cconfirmed a Micro SDxc card and  64GB capacity can  work in the memory card slot of my Windows 7 Pro slate device.  Purchased  the memory card at a very attractive price. ( Amazon was offering a daily deal at the same time period I needed the product)  Memory card arrived without delay.  Packaging was very siimple (worry free...for real).  Plugged  SD card in my slate. PC card slot.  Formatted card to exFAT  vs  NTFS ( after more research ).and I was ready to go.  Transferred my photos and music from SSD  to the SD card.  Freed up valuable  SSD real estate for OS use and my Slate PC is again  humming  with lot more  SSD space available. Plays back  music, video & photo slideshows smoothly from the card. Delivers on function.  Very  satisfied with purchase ..and highly recommended 5 stars no hesitation !..."
5.0,"I really dont have much to say about SanDisk's cards. They work as intended, I never had a problem with them."
5.0,This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd's and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks' are amazing. I've bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I've had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I've had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product.
5.0,good with low pricethankssandisk ulttra i used it for my dash cam. and its works. i can record unto 32g but as user i regularly formatting 1or 2 times amonths to keep memory in a good conditionthanks
5.0,This item stopped working about a week after I got it. Not the best product
5.0,I have bought two of these for both computers because they are easy to install and operate without a hitch!
5.0,"I was surprised to see the main drive in my Dell Venue Pro 8 was almost completely consumed by the Windows OS.  I added this card to create some space for myself.  The tablet recognized it as an additional disc with 29GB available.  That gives me plenty of breathing room for what I do with the tablet, and the speed is incredible.  I am very pleased with this product, and will purchase another one when I upgrade the card in my GoPro this summer."
5.0,Excelent
5.0,Have always had good experiences with SanDisk products.  This was priced well.  I have installed it in my wife's cell phone and it was immediately  recognized.  Not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal - extra features or not.
5.0,A coffee shop must
5.0,"Nothing bad to say, great product, great price. Works excellently in my video camera. One won't go wrong with this card."
5.0,Utilizing for my GOPRO Hero3 Black....no issues at all filming and transferring to my computer.  Good transfer rate and glad I got the 64GB for all the filming / photos done.
5.0,Got here fast and it worked
5.0,"I have no issues with this card. It works great and now I have a ton of storage space for music and what not. Bit overkill, but that's how I like it."
5.0,"I've only had it for about a week but so far I love it, it's small and I am able to put it on a lanyard or any keychain - this i exactly what I was looking for. For the price the amount of space it can hold is unbelievable, I recommend this product to all those looking for a cheap, small USB."
5.0,"Added space for movies, games, books, pictures, and music. Also great to relive the carrier's stock S4 for space. All major US carriers only supported the 16GB version of the S4"
5.0,Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I've always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone.
5.0,Love my Kindle.  It is so small and so easy to carry in my purse.  Holds a charge for days.  Highly recommend this item.
5.0,"This is the SD card you need for your smart phone. I bought this for my S3 and been using it for over a year and it works perfect. I don't think ill ever have to worry about running out of space. Plus the price on Amazon, you cant beat it."
5.0,"Works great. Adapter makes it easy to load music, ebooks, pictures and movies onto card for use on a phone or tablet."
5.0,Data in and data out seems to be nice and fast. It was a quick ship. If I needed more I would order the SanDisk.
5.0,Used this card in my Galaxy S3 and have had no problems.  Tons-o-room for what ever you want and more.
5.0,Formated to FAT32 using Easy Partition Home Edition (free on the web) and it works on both my Samsung Galaxy S ii phone and Asus TF101 tabletAm gonna buy another one so each can have one
5.0,"Fast computer for my cnc, works great."
5.0,"This product arrived in two days (Prime), it was exactly what I ordered and it works great in my Galaxy S3. I know a class 10 is not exactly needed in a cell phone but it cannot hurt, right? I'm very happy with this purchase."
5.0,Wonderful card and performs fast and efficient. I use it with my Samsung Galaxie S3 with no problems. Love the hjgh caparcity it offers and reliability of SanDisk
5.0,works as advertised. Using this with Q10 which supports only 32gb. So far no issues. totally happy with the purchase.
5.0,Correctly priced. I bought it to use with my surface pro. Works great out of the box and transfer speeds are excellent.
5.0,doesn't seems to be some chinese crap... looks like it's the original one... works fine with my galaxy s4 and also with my tablet... 100% recommended...
5.0,Used this in my S4 and in my new S5. Transfer speed is good and it is still performing well after almost a year. I haven't been disappointed with a SanDisk product yet.
5.0,Great
5.0,"Works well with the tablet and htc phone, it doesn't need to do formatting. The devices recognized immediately with no problem. Recommended!"
5.0,"This is the card that solved the problem with three dash cams that would not operate properly, the problem was the cheap wrong type SD Card, use this card and it works!!!"
5.0,"I bought the 64GB MicroSD card at Best Buy because I needed one for my Microsoft Surface Pro. It provides all the space I need and for people who need a lot of space (videos, Quick Books, picture editing, games, etc.) this card is the one for you. If you don't need that much space, consider buying one for cheaper with a little less memory.NOTE: Be aware that this is a MicroSDXC format card. While most new computers support this format, many of the older computers do not (This includes all but a few tablets and smartphones). Before buying this, MAKE SURE your computer, tablet, or smartphone is compatible. If it is not, it will not work, period. For others who claim that the card doesn't work no matter what they try, chances are their machine cannot support MicroSDXC format."
5.0,"Using this in a contout gps camera,  don't waste your time buying any other brand it will be a waste. Buy the best to start with."
5.0,"The read/write speeds are fantastic. Works great in my Galaxy Note 2. I absolutely love the space, it was worth every single penny."
5.0,Worked as promised.  Arrived overnight as required for scheduled presentation.
5.0,"As soon as I learned that my Nokia Lumia 1520 would gladly accept 128Gb MicroSD card, I sought one out. The $119 promo price on Amazon had evaporated along with the stock of the rare cards! The price had skyrocketed to nearly $200, AND THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK!? I pined. I whined. Then, one day, in early May, there it was! Back on Amazon, for the awesome price point of $119! I pulled the trigger immediately! Well, apparently the cards were on backorder, but in was a short wait. Four days later, I had my card. After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper. Read/write speeds are good, and the only really noticible lag is when taking photos, but that has a lot to do with my choosing to take photos with a 5Mp ""low rest"" version, and a corresponding 16Mp RAW version,, too. Other than that, this drive has allowed me to store >1Gb apps(games), (of which I have many), and tons of pics, and 1080p videos! I'd say, that if your phone accepts 128Gb cards, this is a no brainer!"
5.0,I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items.
5.0,Fits my Galaxy SIII and gives me lots of storage :] Should be just the thing that I was looking for
5.0,"SanDisk is all I use. These are the backup microSDXCs for my two pro Canon cameras. They always work, never had one fail, and will store thousands of JPEGS on this card. I shoot in RAW on my CF card but simultaneously have a JPEG backup onto this card. I've never filled one even though I shoot thousands of photos on photo shoots."
5.0,The recent map update on my Garmin GPS ran it out of memory.  Maps are getting more and more detailed.  I used this to up the memory and got back to the Full North America Map. It cam with the adapter to fit my PC SD slot too.
5.0,I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last!
5.0,"So far so good. I use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly. No issue as of yet. Overall, I'm happy with this product."
5.0,"What can I say, So far it came in and works. Can't complain till it fails, so only time will tell..."
5.0,it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.
5.0,This memory card works in both my Nook and my Canon camera.  I chose this disk because it will hold lots of pictures.  It was shipped earlier than expected.
5.0,"Brilliant design and excellent value for money, perfect for the job - very pleased."
5.0,I have been looking for a 64GB memory card and I found one at our local electronics store but it was over $100.  I logged onto Amazon.com and found this at a great price.  Why pay more when you can come to Amazon and get it for less.
5.0,Love it fits perfectly.
5.0,"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]"
5.0,"I have rip music from SACD and DSD to put on this microSD and it can playback smoothly on FiioX3 Digital Audio player, no matter how big the file is."
5.0,I have a Vostro 1540 this is a perfect fit.  My old battery was dying which was causing overheating and random shutdowns (when the computer got to hot).  This new battery fix both of those issues.  The battery has the Dell logo and a made in china sticker much better then getting the same battery from Dell for 4 times the cost.
5.0,This product is perfect for what I needed it for. Providing a ton of memory in my Samsung Note 10.1 in a small package.
5.0,Love at a great $!!!
5.0,"This is an amazing memory chip card. At less than half the size of a regular postage stamp, this card fits my Garmin GPS and allows me to take oodles of photos along for viewing. AND, it comes with an adapter to allow using it in my PC with one of the many multi-card readers. 32 Gigabytes in such a tiny card and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended."
5.0,I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0,I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC.
5.0,"This is my second order of this exact battery. The first one lasted me for 2.5 years before swelling up, which is exactly what my genuine apple battery did after a couple of years anyway, so that seems to be an apple defect that we all have to live with.<br /><br />This works great, fits great and the color matches the aluminum on my macbook pro perfectly. And considering that apple doesn't manufacture these anymore, this is a GREAT investment. And i's under $30."
5.0,got for my Cell Phone and this card works nice and fast on my cell phone as well as on my pc to load it.
5.0,Easy to install and works perfectly.
5.0,Works great to store my pics and videos!
5.0,Great price for a great product works great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4 why anyone [pays full price at the cell provider is beyond me! Keep up the good work Amazon love you guys!!
5.0,"My hubby is now complete and very happy that he has ths for his Go Pro. Haven't tested it out yet, but we will soon."
5.0,"Works exactly as you would expect it to. Sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality, highly recommended."
5.0,"The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to."
5.0,Bought this to go with my Samsung Galaxy S III. It is class 10 which means it is fast. Works well.
5.0,"With the smaller electronics we finally are able to save on a card, it has an adapter so it will fit in the larger bays.  There is a lot of storage in such a small space.  I have been looking for the small cards to fit in my pad."
5.0,I shopped several other places for a good deal on a quality memory card and found it at amazon once again
5.0,My local electronics store had no inventory for memory in Micro-SDHC format. Amazon fixed that problem.This came in quickly and was a breeze to install. It saved me $15 - and that was an added bonus.Now I can download all my music to my cell phone.Problem solved.
5.0,love this item....would recommend
5.0,Use this charger everyday. Love it.  I need to look for a longer one.
5.0,Is there any more I can say? No! I get it less than 30 bucks! You can use it in your cellphone or whatever support it.
5.0,Use it every day.
5.0,"Easy to install, works perfectly."
5.0,"Plenty of extra storage can load a lot of movies in high definition, music and a boat load of other stuff."
5.0,Got here within a couple of days of ordering.  Easy to install and works great.  I wanted extra storage and this was right size for me.
5.0,"as described. took 3 weeks to arrive from china but its the real thing, same as picture. Speeds are good, 30mb/s read, 10mb/s write."
5.0,Perfect fit for my Ipad 1st generation.
5.0,Device works exactly as expected.  Holds a lot of music videos.  Would recomment to anyone.  Great product!  What else can I say!
5.0,I almost got myself a 16GB but decided on the 32GB last minute.  I'm so glad I did - I filled up my Hero3 White edition with over 20k time-lapse images and a few hours of HD footage.  These things are solid and reliable.  I filled it up over a 6 day period doing some work in Haiti.
5.0,Works perfectly. I can take the microSDHC from my Galaxy Player and use the adaptor to plug it into my iMac with no problem at all.
5.0,"I made sure to get the one in the retail packaging when ordering. It arrived next day from Amazon. I tore open the packaging and inserted the card directly into my Note 10.1. The card was picked up right away, no formatting needed. I will say, I had updated my unit to 4.1.2 first so I am unsure if the update is what made the recognition so easy. Already crammed it half full with movies and music. Plays all of them smooth with no lag or speed issues whatsoever. I think I will get another."
5.0,"boost the mp3 player size thanks, more more if you have the music or video's can not go wrong with more memory"
5.0,"Needed a cable to finish a video install in a hurry, fast shipping made it all come together great"
5.0,Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.
5.0,Got a Samsung Galaxy note 2 7.0 I'm gonna use for a CarPC and found that you could install a 64gb microSD. Tried this one and it worked flawlessly. Pretty zippy too for a tablet (ugh....tablets read/write is stupid slow but just good enough for media I suppose)Plugged this thing right in and used the tablet to format it. Got 60gb out of it. Good good.
5.0,I purchased this memory card to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it worked right out of the box. I haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. I would highly recommend this or the 64GB version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.
5.0,The SanDisk memory card is awesome. I usually only buy SanDisk products because they are very reliable. Very good quality.
5.0,As to be expected this SanDisk works as advertised in my Garmin 850 GPS. I am satisfied with this product.
5.0,Lots of compliments on this case
5.0,Best case ever for a toddler
5.0,"So far so good. I've never noticed a difference in memory cards, I'm just very glad to have extra memory!"
5.0,Great replacement for my internal adapter that drops and doesn't even connect at times.
5.0,I use this memory card with my GoPro Hero 3 Silver Camera. I have had no issues recording 1080p video with this memory card. It provides sufficient write speeds. I bought the 16gb version. I wish I would have bought the 32gb version as 1080p videos become large files quite fast.
5.0,perfect
5.0,"The desk is great and works as advertised.<br />Suggestion for improvement: The edge of the legs should have a non-skid/non-slide surface. If you place the stand on a smooth table top, it keeps moving due to your pressure on the keyboard. The movement is very slow (the stand moves about an inch during 3-4 hours of working). A small rubbery sheath on the legs would make it much better."
5.0,Great little card. Will allow 1080p recording on my note 3 phone. Frustration free packaging is genius. Make sure your device supports the high capacity card before ordering.
5.0,This is the lowest priced 64 gb card I could find and it works great in my HERO go pro camera
5.0,"I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That's 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I'd throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I'd post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn't make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you're rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card."
5.0,"Great price for the chip, fastest speed on the market, and fast service good job. 16gb is a great amount of storage for the price, even better than 32 or 64gb, great for cameras, phones, tablets, etc."
5.0,Works great in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.Put the memory cards in and go to storage in the settings.  Click format card and off you go.I have not measured read or write speed but i can tell you i can copy over 1Gb video file in just a few seconds.
5.0,"great mouse, great price. I own this, as well as several friends and co-workers.  It's small, and performs perfectly. The small USB receiver is small enough that it can be left in all the time if you want."
5.0,Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues!
5.0,Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music.
5.0,"How do I praise extra memory? It fills my MP3 player with every song my heart desires, the sound quality is perfect. The ease of use is superb. It's great."
5.0,"I haven't done much to speed test this device, but it does everything I ask it to and the price was right."
5.0,It arrived on time as schedule. It was purchased on black Friday sale so the price was much cheaper than current listing price. I am now regretting not going with the 64GB as recommended by my coworker.  I purchased it for my new Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone.
5.0,"stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues."
5.0,excelent
5.0,"Worked out great, met all expectations"
5.0,Was exactly what my son wanted and was delivery very quickly! Very happy with the product!
5.0,"Love it, use it to store videos and photos on a Galaxy S3. Good stuff no problems yet like with my bootleg Transcend card."
5.0,Good value for product. I wanted 64 GB to put all my music on my phone.  Easily transferred from from hard disk to microSD via USB cable.
